WoS,Combination of photoactive hypericin and Manumycin A exerts multiple anticancer effects on oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cells,"The use of natural products as chemotherapeutic agents and tools for manipulation of apoptosis represent an attractive therapeutic concept. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activities of a combination of two natural compounds with different origin, hypericin (plant product) in its photoactive state and Manumycin A (yeast product) and explored the underlying mechanisms of their pro-apoptotic action using an oxaliplatin-resistant variant of human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29-OxR as the experimental model. CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the drugs. CalcuSyn software was used to identify the type of interaction between the two agents. BrdU incorporation assay and colony forming assay were performed to study the short- and long-term proliferation of cells. To evaluate the ability of the drug combination to induce apoptosis, PARP p85 fragment was detected using the ELISA method. Changes in apoptosis-related proteins were examined by immunoassays. Our results showed that a synergistic combination of photoactive hypericin and Manumycin A decreased viability, inhibited both short- and long-term cell proliferation, decreased levels of IAPs proteins (cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP and survivin), induced an apoptotic PARP cleavage associated with decline in procaspase-3 level, promoted phagocytosis of cancer cells, and restored chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin.",Chemoresistance; Oxaliplatin; Colorectal cancer; Natural products; Apoptosis; Chemosensitization,"Macejova, M; Sackova, V; Hradicka, P; Jendzelovsky, R; Demeckova, V; Fedorocko, P",2020.0,Journal,TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO,10.1016/j.tiv.2020.104860,"[Macejova, Maria; Sackova, Veronika; Jendzelovsky, Rastislav; Fedorocko, Peter] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Sci, Inst Biol & Ecol, Dept Cellular Biol, Srobarova 2, Kosice 04154, Slovakia; [Hradicka, Petra; Demeckova, Vlasta] Pavol Jozef Safarik Univ Kosice, Fac Sci, Inst Biol & Ecol, Dept Anim Physiol, Srobarova 2, Kosice 04154, Slovakia",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0887-2333,
WoS,Comprehensive analysis and manufacture of recycled aluminum based hybrid metal matrix composites through the combined method; sintering and sintering plus forging,"Recycled AA7075 aluminum alloy and pure electrolytic copper were used as the matrix to manufacture new aluminum-copper metal matrix composites (ACMMCs). Powder metallurgy methods were used and the green compacts were finalized by sintering only and sinter thorn forging. Experimental and numerical investigation of recycled hybrid metal matrix composites manufactured by the two methods was performed. Al-Cu matrix combined with the reinforcements ZnO, Nb2Al and SiC. Two basic formulations were used where the contents Nb2Al and SiC was kept constant and the content of ZnO were 15 wt% and 30 wt%, respectively. The effects of these reinforcements used in the hybrid metal matrix composite structure on the mechanical and physical properties were investigated. The Nb2Al, SiC ratios used in the structure (chemical interaction in the internal structure, the effects on static-dynamic compression and wear behaviors) were kept constant, in particular the ZnO component (interactions with other components and their effects on electrical properties) were investigated. Micro-hardness analyses, surface scratch tests, quasi-static and dynamic compression tests were conducted. Also, electrical conductivity of the composites were determined. The effect of the composite's formulations and production method on the results were investigated. It was found when ZnO content was reduced the yield stress and ultimate strength values increased, but their resistance to impact loading reduced. Also, sinter thorn forged samples exhibited higher yield stress and ultimate strength than the just sintered samples. The damage and microstructural analyses were performed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Moreover, a non-linear numerical model was utilized to simulate quasi-static compression and dynamic compression (low velocity impact) behaviors of the composites for both formulations and manufacturing methods. Finite element simulations were performed using the ABAQUS T/Explicit dynamic finite element software. It was determined that there was a satisfactory agreement between experimental and finite element model results.",Aluminum copper metal matrix composites (ACMMCs); Sintered-forging; Low velocity impact; Compression behaviour; Finite element method (FEM); SEM Analysis,"Enginsoy, HM; Bayraktar, E; Katundi, D; Gatamorta, F; Miskioglu, I",2020.0,Journal,COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.compositesb.2020.108040,"[Enginsoy, H.

WoS,High performance solution of skew-symmetric eigenvalue problems with applications in solving the Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem,"We present a high-performance solver for dense skew-symmetric matrix eigenvalue problems. Our work is motivated by applications in computational quantum physics, where one solution approach to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation involves the solution of a large, dense, skew-symmetric eigenvalue problem. The computed eigenpairs can be used to compute the optical absorption spectrum of molecules and crystalline systems. One state-of-the art high-performance solver package for symmetric matrices is the ELPA (Eigenvalue SoLvers for Petascale Applications) library. We exploit a link between tridiagonal skew-symmetric and symmetric matrices in order to extend the methods available in ELPA to skew-symmetric matrices. This way, the presented solution method can benefit from the optimizations available in ELPA that make it a well-established, efficient and scalable library. The solution strategy is to reduce a matrix to tridiagonal form, solve the tridiagonal eigenvalue problem and perform a back-transformation for eigenvectors of interest. ELPA employs a one-step or a two-step approach for the tridiagonalization of symmetric matrices. We adapt these to suit the skew-symmetric case. The two-step approach is generally faster as memory locality is exploited better. If all eigenvectors are required, the performance improvement is counteracted by the additional back transformation step. We exploit the symmetry in the spectrum of skew-symmetric matrices, such that only half of the eigenpairs need to be computed, making the two-step approach the favorable method. We compare performance and scalability of our method to the only available high-performance approach for skew-symmetric matrices, an indirect route involving complex arithmetic. In total, we achieve a performance that is up to 3.67 times higher than the reference method using Intel's ScaLAPACK implementation. Our method is freely available in the current release of the ELPA library. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Risk management in the software life cycle: A systematic literature review,"Risk management (RM) plays a key role in project management, as it allows identification and prompt management of threats that may arise during project execution. Furthermore, project management within the software industry is evolving rapidly nowadays, a fact that implies new challenges, because the emergence and use of fresh approaches has brought a greater degree of complexity to the RM process. The objective of this paper is to carry out a systematic literature review (SLR) in the field of software risk, in an attempt to characterize and present the state of the art of this field, identifying gaps and opportunities for further research. From the analysis of the results of this SLR it could be observed that interest on the part of the scientific community has turned away from the definition of research work that addressed an integrated risk management process, to pay attention to work that concentrates on specific activities of this process. It was also possible to see that there is a clear lack of scientific rigour as regards the process of validation in the different studies, and a deficiency in the use of standards or of de facto models to define these.",Software risk; Risk management activities; ISO 31000; Software life cycle processes; ISO 12207; Systematic literature review,"Masso, J; Pino, FJ; Pardo, C; Garcia, F; Piattini, M",2020.0,Review,COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES,10.1016/j.csi.2020.103431,"[Masso, Jhon; Garcia, Felix; Piattini, Mario] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Alarcos Res Grp, Inst Technol & Informat Syst, Paseo Univ 4, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Masso, Jhon; Pardo, Cesar] Univ Cauca, Elect & Telecommun Engn Fac, GTI Res Grp, Calle 5 4-70, Popayan 190002, Colombia; [Pino, Francisco J.] Univ Cauca, Elect & Telecommun Engn Fac, IDIS Res Grp, Calle 5 4-70, Popayan 190002, Colombia",ELSEVIER,English,0920-5489,
WoS,Inclusion of Functional and Non-Functional Parameters for the Prediction of Overall Efforts of Mobile Applications,"Size is a major and main parameter for the estimation of efforts and cost of software applications in general and mobile applications in particular and estimating effort, cost and time has been a key step in the life cycle of the software project. In order to create a sound schedule for the project, it is therefore important to have these estimates as soon as possible in the software development life cycle. In past years, many methods have been employed to estimate size and efforts of mobile applications but till now these methods do not meet the expected needs from customer. In this paper, we present a new size measurement method i.e., Mobile COSMIC Function Points (MCFP) based on the COSMIC approach, which is a primary factor for estimation of efforts in mobile application development. This paper analyzes the possibility of using a combination of Functional and Nonfunctional parameters including both Mobile Technical Complexity Factors (MTCF) and Mobile Environmental Complexity Factors (MECF) for the purpose of mobile application sizing prediction and hence effort estimation. For the purpose of this study, thirty six mobile applications were analyzed and their size and efforts were compared by applying the new effort estimation approach. In this context of a mobile application, few investigations have been performed to compare the effectiveness of COSMIC, FP's and the proposed approach COSMIC Plus Effort Estimation Model (CPEEM). The main goal of this paper is to investigate if the inclusion of Non functional parameters imposes an effect on the functional size of mobile application development. Upon estimating efforts using the proposed approach, the results were promising for mobile applications when compared the results of our approach with the results of the other two approaches",Mobile size measures; Functional size; Functional parameters; Non-functional parameters; Mobile technical complexity factors; Mobile environmental complexity factors,"Mushtaq, Z; Wahid, A",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES,10.1016/j.csi.2019.103404,"[Mushtaq, Ziema] Maulana Azad Natl Urdu Univ, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Wahid, Abdul] Maulana Azad Natl Urdu Univ, Sch Technol, Hyderabad, Telangana, India",ELSEVIER,English,0920-5489,
WoS,Factory Communications at the Dawn of the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"The fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) and its requirements impose radical changes to the underlying networking technologies that will be adopted in future factories. Most popular solutions in use today, in fact, are suitable for Industry 4.0 only in part, and new techniques and devices have to be developed to cope with demanding needs in terms of flexibility, communication bandwidth, real-time behavior, mobility, scalability, energy efficiency, reliability, availability and security. The goal of this paper is assessing the current situation of factory communication systems in the light of their evolution to support Industry 4.0 applications.

WoS,High cycle fatigue behavior and numerical evaluation of Alloy 690TT steam generator tube,"High cycle fatigue behavior of Alloy 690TT steam generator (SG) tube under different maximum stresses was investigated at stress ratio R = 0.1 through experimental and numerical evaluation. The morphology of fatigue fracture surface was observed by SEM, and the crack initiation and propagation mechanism of Alloy 690TT SG tube was analyzed. The fatigue crack of Alloy 690TT SG tube initiated at the intrados surface edge, then propagated along the direction of maximum shear stress and penetrated through the side of the specimen, and finally transient fracture occurred in the direction perpendicular to the loading axis. With the increase of maximum stress, the number of fatigue crack initiation sources increased, but they were all distributed on the edge of the intrados surface, and a large number of persistent slip bands (PSBs) were formed on the intrados surface. The fracture mechanism of the tubular specimen was different from that of the bar specimen, and its fracture mode affected the life evaluation of the tubular specimen. The finite element analysis software ABAQUS and advanced fatigue durability analysis software FE-SAFE were first used to evaluate the fatigue life of Alloy 690TT SG tube.

WoS,An experimental and practical study on the equivalent mutant connection: An evolutionary approach,"Context: Mutation testing is considered to be a powerful approach to assess and improve the quality of test suites. However, this technique is expensive mainly because some mutants are semantically equivalent to the original program; in general, equivalent mutants require manual revision to differentiate them from useful ones, which is known as the Equivalent Mutant Problem (EMP). Objective: In the past, several authors have proposed different techniques to individually identify certain equivalent mutants, with notable advances in the last years. In our work, by contrast, we address the EMP from a global perspective. Namely, we wonder the extent to which equivalent mutants are connected (i.e., whether they share mutation operators and code areas) as well as the extent to which the knowledge of that connection can benefit the mutant selection process. Such a study could allow going beyond the implicit limit in the traditional individual detection of equivalent mutants. Method: We use an evolutionary algorithm to select the mutants, an approach called Evolutionary Mutation Testing (EMT). We propose a new derived version, Equivalence-Aware EMT (EA-EMT), which penalizes the fitness of known equivalent mutants so that they do not transfer their features to the next generations of mutants. Results: In our experiments applying EMT to well-known C++ programs, we found that (i) equivalent mutants often originate from other equivalent mutants (over 60% on average); (H) EA-EMT's approach of penalizing known equivalent mutants provides better results than the original EMT in most of the cases (notably, the more equivalent mutants are detected, the better); and (Hi) we can combine EA-EMT with Trivial Compiler Equivalence as a way to automatically identify equivalent mutants in a real situation, reaching a more stable version of EMT. Conclusions: This novel approach opens the way for improvement in other related areas that deal with equivalent versions.",Mutation testing; Equivalent mutant problem; Search-based software engineering; Evolutionary algorithm,"Delgado-Perez, P; Chicano, F",2020.0,Journal,INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.infsof.2020.106317,"[Delgado-Perez, Pedro] Univ Cadiz, Escuela Super Ingn, Cadiz, Spain; [Chicano, Francisco] Univ Malaga, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Informat, Malaga, Spain",ELSEVIER,English,0950-5849,

Managing these things is still considered a challenge. One way to overcome this challenge may be by adopting the software product line (SPL) paradigm and the variability management (VM) activity. SPL engineering consists of mechanisms that provide identification, representation, and traceability, which may be helpful to things management supported by VM organizational and technical activities. Objective: This research aims to investigate how SPL engineering has been applied along with the IoT paradigm, as well as how VM is being carried out. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted considering papers available until March 2019. This systematic review identified 1039 papers. After eliminating the duplicated titles and the ones not related to the review, 112 papers remained. The number of papers was narrowed to 56 after applying the exclusion criteria.

WoS,LTRWES: A new framework for security bug report detection,"Context: Security bug reports (SBRs) usually contain security-related vulnerabilities in software products, which could be exploited by malicious attackers. Hence, it is important to identify SBRs quickly and accurately among bug reports (BRs) that have been disclosed in bug tracking systems. Although a few methods have been already proposed for the detection of SBRs, challenging issues still remain due to noisy samples, class imbalance and data scarcity. Object: This motivates us to reveal the potential challenges faced by the state-of-the-art SBRs prediction methods from the viewpoint of data filtering and representation. Furthermore, the purpose of this paper is also to provide a general framework and new solutions to solve these problems. Method: In this study, we propose a novel approach LTRWES that incorporates learning to rank and word embedding into the identification of SBRs. Unlike previous keyword-based approaches, LTRWES is a content-based data filtering and representation framework that has several desirable properties not shared in other methods. Firstly, it exploits ranking model to efficiently filter non-security bug reports (NSBRs) that have higher content similarity with respect to SBRs. Secondly, it applies word embedding technology to transform the rest of NSBRs, together with SBRs, into low-dimensional real-value vectors. Result: Experiment results on benchmark and large real-world datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method. Conclusion: Overall, the LTRWES is valid with high performance. It will help security engineers to identify SBRs from thousands of NSBRs more accurately than existing algorithms. Therefore, this will positively encourage the research and development of the content-based methods for security bug report detection.",Security bug report; Content-based filtering; Word embedding; Machine learning,"Jiang, Y; Lu, PC; Su, XH; Wang, TT",2020.0,Journal,INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.infsof.2020.106314,"[Jiang, Yuan; Lu, Pengcheng; Su, Xiaohong; Wang, Tiantian] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER,English,0950-5849,
WoS,Multiple fault localization of software programs: A systematic literature review,"Context: Multiple fault localization (MFL) is the act of identifying the locations of multiple faults (more than one fault) in a faulty software program. This is known to be more complicated, tedious, and costly in comparison to the traditional practice of presuming that a software contains a single fault. Due to the increasing interest in MFL by the research community, a broad spectrum of MFL debugging approaches and solutions have been proposed and developed. Objective: The aim of this study is to systematically review existing research on MFL in the software fault localization (SFL) domain. This study also aims to identify, categorize, and synthesize relevant studies in the research domain. Method: Consequently, using an evidence-based systematic methodology, we identified 55 studies relevant to four research questions. The methodology provides a systematic selection and evaluation process with rigorous and repeatable evidence-based studies selection process. Result: The result of the systematic review shows that research on MFL is gaining momentum with stable growth in the last 5 years. Three prominent MFL debugging approaches were identified, i.e. One-bug-at-a-time debugging approach (OBA), parallel debugging approach, and multiple-bug-at-a-time debugging approach (MBA), with OBA debugging approach being utilized the most. Conclusion: The study concludes with some identified research challenges and suggestions for future research. Although MFL is becoming of grave concern, existing solutions in the field are less mature. Studies utilizing real faults in their experiments are scarce. Concrete solutions to reduce MFL debugging time and cost by adopting an approach such as MBA debugging approach are also less, which require more attention from the research community.",Program debugging; Parallel debugging; Fault localization; Multiple faults; One-bug-at-a-time (OBA),"Zakari, A; Lee, SP; Abreu, R; Ahmed, BH; Rasheed, RA",2020.0,Review,INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.infsof.2020.106312,"[Zakari, Abubakar] Kano Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, PMB 3244, Kano, Nigeria; [Lee, Sai Peck; Ahmed, Babiker Hussien] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Software Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Rasheed, Rasheed Abubakar] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Abreu, Rui] Univ Lisbon, INESC ID, Lisbon, Portugal; [Abreu, Rui] Univ Lisbon, IST, Lisbon, Portugal",ELSEVIER,English,0950-5849,

During the two projected periods, there was a decrease in runoff & transpiration and an increase in evaporation. The maize yield projected to decrease by about 9% during both periods. The combined effect of tied ridges and increased fertilizer under elevated CO2 concentration increased the crop yield by almost 90% during the 2021-2050 climate projection periods.

WoS,The effect of airline passenger anthropometry on aircraft emergency evacuations,"This paper demonstrates the impact of passenger anthropometry on the emergency egress for both single aisle and double aisle aircraft. A demographic model of passenger anthropometry based on Body Mass Index (BMI) categories was developed building upon data retrieved from an online database. Knowing that the prevalence of obesity is becoming greater at a global scale, various obesity condition were simulated to explore the effects of an increased number of obese/overweight passenger on-board medium and large aircrafts. Verification of the software used in egress simulations was carried out by undertaking a trial mimicking a real-life evacuation. The simulated results show that for current levels of BMI prevalence the time to evacuate an aircraft is 76.6 s (95% CI, 76.2-76.9) for a narrow-body and 87.1 s (95% CI, 86.7-87.7) for a wide-body aircraft. Leaving current prevalence of BMI categories unchanged but increasing overall obesity by just 5% can lead to an increase of the egress time of approximately 2 s for the wide-body aircraft scenario. The egress time is significantly increased when greater percentages of obese passengers are considered. The results show that the egress time for a population with a demographic distribution similar to that expected in the next 30 years exceeds the current time limit of 90 s considered by aviation authorities for certification purposes of passenger aircraft.",Passenger anthropometry; Aircraft evacuations; Obesity; Emergency egress,"Melis, DJ; Silva, JM; Yeun, R; Wild, G",2020.0,Journal,SAFETY SCIENCE,10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104749,"[Melis, Damien J.; Silva, Jose M.; Yeun, Richard; Wild, Graham] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",ELSEVIER,English,0925-7535,
WoS,Do Not Disturb While Driving - Use of cellphone blockers among adult drivers,"Introduction: Cellphone blockers are an emerging countermeasure for limiting driver distraction. This study focused on Apple's Do Not Disturb While Driving (DND) application because of its unique rollout where owners were prompted to try it as part of a software update. Method: A telephone survey of 800 adult drivers who own smartphones was conducted to estimate cellphone blocker use. Logistic regression estimated relationships between cellphone blocker use and likelihood of reported cellphone use while driving. Results: Only 20.5% of respondents with DND-compatible iPhones had DND set to activate automatically when driving or when connected to a vehicle's Bluetooth. Among respondents with DND-incompatible phones, 18.7% of respondents reported having an alternative non-DND blocker, and only half of these reported turning it on while driving at least three quarters of the time. Thirty-nine percent of drivers with DND-compatible iPhones who had DND set to turn on when manually activated trip-by-trip said they would not be frustrated if they received another prompt to use the application, and 26.7% reported they would be likely to try it if they received another prompt. Respondents classified as using blockers were less likely to report cellphone use, although results varied between those with DND and other blockers. Conclusion: Cellphone blockers have potential to limit cellphone distractions, although it is uncertain whether differences in behaviors reported here are caused by blockers or are a result of drivers selecting to use blockers because they are averse to phone use while driving. Practical applications: Prompts to activate cellphone blockers from providers may increase their use.",Cellphone blockers; Cellphone use; Cellphone behavior; Driver distraction; Highway safety,"Reagan, IJ; Cicchino, JB",2020.0,Journal,SAFETY SCIENCE,10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104753,"[Reagan, Ian J.; Cicchino, Jessica B.] Insurance Inst Highway Safety, 1005 N Glebe Rd, Arlington, VA 22201 USA",ELSEVIER,English,0925-7535,
WoS,A classification framework for automated control code generation in industrial automation,"Software development for the automation of industrial facilities (e.g., oil platforms, chemical plants, power plants, etc.) involves implementing control logic, often in IEC 61131-3 programming languages. Developing safe and efficient program code is expensive and today still requires substantial manual effort. Researchers have thus proposed numerous approaches for automatic control logic generation in the last two decades, but a systematic, in-depth analysis of their capabilities and assumptions is missing. This paper proposes a novel classification framework for control logic generation approaches defining criteria derived from industry best practices. The framework is applied to compare and analyze 13 different control logic generation approaches.

WoS,Automated defect identification via path analysis-based features with transfer learning,"Recently, artificial intelligence techniques have been widely applied to address various specialized tasks in software engineering, such as code generation, defect identification, and bug repair. Despite the diffuse usage of static analysis tools in automatically detecting potential software defects, developers consider the large number of reported alarms and the expensive cost of manual inspection to be a key barrier to using them in practice. To automate the process of defect identification, researchers utilize machine learning algorithms with a set of hand-engineered features to build classification models for identifying alarms as actionable or unactionable. However, traditional features often fail to represent the deep syntactic structure of alarms. To bridge the gap between programs' syntactic structure and defect identification features, this paper first extracts a set of novel fine-grained features at variable-level, called path-variable characteristic, by applying path analysis techniques in the feature extraction process. We then raise a two-stage transfer learning approach based on our proposed features, called feature ranking-matching based transfer learning, to increase the performance of cross-project defect identification. Our experimental results for eight open-source projects show that the proposed features at variable-level are promising and can yield significant improvement on both within-project and cross-project defect identification.

WoS,A case study of agile software development for safety-Critical systems projects,"This study explores the introduction of agile software development within an avionics company engaged in safety-critical system engineering. There is increasing pressure throughout the software industry for development efforts to adopt agile software development in order to respond more rapidly to changing requirements and make more frequent deliveries of systems to customers for review and integration. This pressure is also being experienced in safety-critical industries, where release cycles on typically large and complex systems may run to several years on projects spanning decades. However, safety-critical system developments are normally highly regulated, which may constrain the adoption of agile software development or require adaptation of selected methods or practices. To investigate this potential conflict, we conducted a series of interviews with practitioners in the company, exploring their experiences of adopting agile software development and the challenges encountered. The study also explores the opportunities for altering the existing software process in the company to better fit agile software development to the constraints of software development for safety-critical systems. We conclude by identifying immediate future research directions to better align the tempo of software development for safety-critical systems and agile software development.",,"Islam, G; Storer, T",2020.0,Journal,RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY,10.1016/j.ress.2020.106954,"[Islam, Gibrail; Storer, Tim] Univ Glasgow, 18 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0951-8320,

WoS,"Comparisons of heuristic, general statistical and machine learning models for landslide susceptibility prediction and mapping","Commonly used data-driven models for landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) can be mainly classified as heuristic, general statistical or machine learning models. This study plans to compare the prediction performance of these data-driven models on the landslide susceptibility mapping, thus further to explore the inherently features of these data-driven models. As a result, a more accurate and reliable LSP can be realized through choosing an optimal data-based model. A heuristic model represented by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a general statistical model represented by the general linear model (GLM) and information value (IV) model, and machine learning models represented by binary logistic regression (BLR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM) and C5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT) are adopted in this study. Shicheng County in China is used as the study area. In total, 369 landslides identified through field investigation are classified as training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Next, 13 landslide conditioning factors (elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, relief amplitude, total surface radiation, population density, Normalized difference vegetation index, distance to river, topographic wetness index and rock types) are acquired from data sources of the free remote sensing images, Digital Elevation Model, field investigation and government reports. The correlations between these conditioning factors and the landslide locations are determined by frequency ratio analysis. Then, the landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs) calculated by the eight trained models are imported into GIS software to produce landslide susceptibility maps of Shicheng County. Finally, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the calculated LSIs are applied to assess the LSP performance of the present eight models. The testing results show that these eight models generate reasonable LSP results as a whole, further showing that the C5.0 DT is of the highest prediction accuracy with an AUC value of 0.868, followed by the SVM (0.813), BPNN (0.803), MLP (0.792), BLR (0.784), GLM (0.779), IV (0.774) and AHP (0.773). It can be inferred that the machine learning models have higher LSP performance than general statistical and heuristic models due to its high AUC accuracy and reasonable LSIs distribution features, while general statistical model is limited by its linear analysis and heuristic model is limited by subjective weighting process.",Landslide susceptibility prediction; Analytic hierarchy process; General statistical model; Machine learning model; C5.0 decision tree; Support vector machine; Back-propagation neural network,"Huang, FM; Cao, ZS; Guo, JF; Jiang, SH; Li, S; Guo, ZZ",2020.0,Journal,CATENA,10.1016/j.catena.2020.104580,"[Huang, Faming; Cao, Zhongshan; Guo, Jianfei; Jiang, Shui-Hua] Nanchang Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Nanchang 330000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Shu] Changjiang Inst Survey Planning Design & Res Co L, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China; [Guo, Zizheng] China Univ Geosci, Fac Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER,English,0341-8162,
WoS,Hysteretic dynamics inducing coexistence of attractors in a thin magnetostrictive actuator system with quintic nonlinearity,"This paper introduces and investigates the dynamics of a thin magnetostrictive actuator with quintic nonlinearity. The energy balance method is used to carry out the motion equation of the system. The analytical solutions and amplitude responses of the system are exanimated using the multiple time scale method. The dynamical behavior of the system is explored with the help of common nonlinear tools such as bifurcation diagrams with Lyapunov exponents, time series plots, phase portraits and basin of attraction. The bifurcation diagrams reveal that the system under study exhibits complicated dynamics including crisis route to chaos, multistability and antimonotonicity. To validate the theoretical and numerical analyses, an electronic circuit capable to describe the dynamics of the system is designed and implemented in PSpice software. A very good agreement is observed between PSpice based circuit simulations and theoretical/numerical results.",Magnetostrictive actuator; Quintic nonlinearity; Mathematical modeling; Bifurcation analysis; Multistability; Pspice based circuit simulations,"Nkeutia, SZ; Tamba, VK; Talla, PK",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS,10.1016/j.jmmm.2020.166858,"[Nkeutia, Sylvain Zango; Talla, Pierre Kisito] Univ Dschang, UFR DSST, UR Mecan & Modelisat Syst Phys UR 2MSP, BP 67, Dschang, Cameroon; [Tamba, Victor Kamdoum] Univ Dschang, UFR DSST, UR Mat Condensee Elect & Traitement Signal UR MAC, BP 67, Dschang, Cameroon; [Tamba, Victor Kamdoum] Univ Dschang, Fotso Victor Univ Inst Technol, Dept Telecommun & Network Engn, POB 134 Bandjoun, Dschang, Cameroon",ELSEVIER,English,0304-8853,
WoS,RMC/CTF multiphysics solutions to VERA core physics benchmark problem #8,"The Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications (VERA) Core Physics Benchmark Progression problems #1 to #10 based on the 17 x 17 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) Watts Bar Unit 1 designed by Westinghouse have been proposed by the Consortium for Advanced Simulations of Light Water Reactors (CASL) as core physics benchmarks. These problems were selected to assist nuclear software and methods developers to develop the capabilities needed to accurately model nuclear power reactors. These problems have 10 different conditions ranging from a simple 2D pin cell to the full core time-dependent depletion. VERA Problem #8, Physical Reactor Flux Maps, describes the first 48 h of a reactor startup with the power gradually increasing from 0% to 100% including the control rod movements which must be considered. This problem was solved in this study using the continuous energy Monte Carlo code RMC coupled with the subchannel thermal-hydraulics code CTF in a hybrid computational strategy. The effects of axial-layering on the solutions were studied with the model divided into 10 layers in the axial direction with the analyses considering both the cost and the accuracy with VERA Problem #8 simulated on the Tianhe II supercomputer. A large number of particles was simulated to get a reliable solution with the mean uncertainty in the power distribution reduced to about 2.6% for all the 526,640 burnup regions for each iteration between RMC and CTF. The eigenvalue trajectory of the critical boron concentration during the startup was provided with the predicted k(eff) which differs from the common continuous decline. The RMC/CTF code also gives a 3D view of the relative power density distribution and the relative uncertainty distribution at three typical time points and the subchannel outlet temperatures whose peak locations are consistent with the radial power distribution. The RMC/CTF solution is the first published coupled Monte Carlo neutronics/subchannel thermal hydraulics solutions for Problem #8. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Dynamic reliability framework for a Nuclear Power Plant using dynamic flowgraph methodology,"Passive safety systems are being considered in advanced reactor designs to provide inherent stability for the operation of the nuclear reactor. Passive shutdown is provided for guaranteed removal of decay heat under emergency conditions. The reliability of such systems should be very high. The static reliability assessment of such systems has been considered using various techniques such as fault tree analysis, failure mode effect analysis, and reliability block diagrams. Dynamic reliability methods are powerful mathematical frameworks capable of handling interactions among components and process variables explicitly. In principle, they constitute a more realistic modelling of systems for the purposes of reliability, risk and safety analysis. Although there is a growing recognition in the risk community of the potentially greater correctness of these methods, no serious effort has been undertaken to utilize them in industrial applications. The dynamic flowgraph methodology is an integrated methodological approach to modelling and analyzing the behavior of software-driven embedded systems for the purpose of reliability/safety assessment and verification. In the present work, dynamic flowgraph methodology has been used to analyze the Station Blackout Scenario for a Nuclear Power Plant. The benefits of the proposed method are brought out with respect to the traditional methods like fault tree analysis, which deteriorates in applicability with increasing system size and complexity and fails to accommodate the dynamics of the system. The proposed method has been validated on the passive residual heat removal system of pressurized heavy water reactor. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Application of high-order numerical algorithm for two-fluid two-pressure model: Hydraulic load analysis,"Hydraulic load analysis is of great importance in the design of pressurized water reactor. It provides load conditions for structural mechanics analysis of primary loop system and ensures the reliability of primary loop pipeline and main equipment. Currently common hydraulic load analysis software mainly includes RELAP5 and WAHA, both of which adopt the classical two-fluid six-equation single pressure model and the first-order differentiation algorithm. The single pressure model is not stable, and its numerical results are prone to oscillation under high-order precision schemes. Meanwhile, the low-order algorithm is not accurate enough, which is not conducive to the simulation of pressure wave problems. However, the two-fluid two-pressure model is unconditionally adaptive. In order to improve the accuracy of the numerical algorithm and ensure the stability of the numerical value, a high-order semi-implicit algorithm for solving the transient term and convection term is developed based on the two-fluid two-pressure model. Finally, the high-order algorithm is applied to the hydraulic load problems such as shock tube, water hammer and blowout. The results show that the algorithm can effectively reduce the numerical diffusion and improve the prediction accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,"Morphological, genetic and essential oil variation of Greek sage (Salvia fruticosa Mill.) populations from Greece","Greek sage (Salvia fruticosa Mill.) is an aromatic-medicinal plant, indigenous to Greece, rich in bioactive ingredients, henceforth in demand by the food, pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. Its use is hampered by the fact that Greek sage cultivars are not available at the moment which is a prerequisite for a sustainable crop production. Development of cultivars requires knowledge of the material's phenotypic range of expression, of the existing genetic diversity, and of the effects of the environment on the phenotypic expression. For this purpose, essential oil (EO) and morphological traits were measured in a hundred individual plant samples of ten populations, from different locations of the Peloponnese (Greece). Significant differences among populations, both in yield and composition of EO, as well as in the morphological traits were observed. In fact, the EO components could assign most of the samples to their respective population (80-100%). The EO yield and main components were consistent, in one of the populations within a three year period of sampling, showing predominance of genetic background. Morphological traits showed a wide range of variation related to altitude, latitude and microclimatic conditions of the collection site, but were not correlated to the EO profile. For the genetic analysis and assessment of the diversity of the populations nine microsatellite markers were used. STRUCTURE analysis revealed the formation of four genetic groups, while PCoA managed to separate all populations according to their location of origin. Correlation was found between the EO composition and genetic diversity by the Mantel test. The present results demonstrate the high variability of the morphological and EO traits, and the high genetic diversity of the Greek sage populations growing in the Peloponnese. This diversity serves as the background for the selection of genotypes towards the development of S. fruticosa cultivars with high EO yield, superior EO composition and desirable agronomic traits.","Salvia fruticosa; Greek sage; Essential oil; 1,8-Cineole; Morphological traits; Microsatellite markers","Leontaritou, P; Lamari, FN; Papasotiropoulos, V; Iatrou, G",2020.0,Journal,INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS,10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112346,"[Leontaritou, Peggy; Iatrou, Gregoris] Univ Patras, Dept Biol, Div Plant Biol, Patras 26504, Greece; [Lamari, Fotini N.] Univ Patras, Dept Pharm, Lab Pharmacognosy & Chem Nat Prod, Patras 26504, Greece; [Papasotiropoulos, Vassilis] Univ Patras, Dept Agr, Lab Agr Genet & Breeding, Amaliada 27200, Greece; [Leontaritou, Peggy] Greek Minist Rural Dev & Food, Dept Rural Dev & Controls Prefecture Achaia, Panepistimiou 334, Patras 26443, Greece",ELSEVIER,English,0926-6690,

WoS,Numerical analysis of the air flow in internal combustion engine intake ducts using Herschel-Quincke tubes,"The alternating movement of the inlet valve and the piston of an internal combustion engine generates pressure waves propagating along the intake duct. This phenomenon alters the admitted air mass flow inside the engine cylinder in some speed ranges. To mitigate the harmful effects of the wave phenomenon, acoustic elements are inserted into the intake system, such as Helmholtz resonators, plenums and Herschel-Quincke tubes. This paper aims to numerically evaluate the air flow in the intake ducts using Herschel-Quincke tubes. The numerical study was carried out using software based on the Characteristics Method, which, considering the one-dimensional transient flow, simulates the wave phenomena inside the ducts. As a result, it was observed that the Herschel-Quincke tubes reduce the pressure amplitude at the inlet valve port, increasing the air flow velocity and the intake air mass flow.

WoS,When facebook and finals collide - procrastinatory social media usage predicts enhanced anxiety,"In the digital age we live in, refraining from procrastinatory social media usage, particularly when conflicting with highly valued goal pursuit, can result in failure and subsequent negative psychological outcomes. Despite mounting interest, existing evidence remains correlational and restricted to mundane contexts. To fill these gaps the current two study investigation provides converging ecological and causal evidence for the influence of procrastinatory social media usage on subsequent anxiety. Study 1 used longitudinal unobtrusive measurement of actual procrastinatory Facebook usage (using designated software) together with experience-sampling, during real-life academic exam preparation period. Findings showed that enhanced procrastinatory Facebook usage predicted increased levels of anxiety over time. Further evidence provided inferences regarding the likely ordering of this association, by ruling out a reversed directionality between anxiety and subsequent Facebook usage. Providing direct causal evidence, Study 2 created a laboratory exam context conceived as highly predictive of academic success, that directly manipulated whether actual Facebook usage was procrastinatory or not, prior to examining its influence on anxiety.

WoS,Online Estimation of ESR for DC-Link Capacitor of Boost PFC Converter Using Wavelet Transform Based Time-Frequency Analysis Method,"Aluminum electrolytic capacitor (AEC) is one of the most age-affected components in ac-dc conversion, and its equivalent series resistance (ESR) is an important index for reflecting the healthy condition of AEC. In AEC-used boost power factor correction (PFC) converters, ESR of AEC causes a small jump in the switching ripple of output voltage at switching moments, especially at turn-off moments. This small jump is hardly observed at line-frequency scale, either using time-domain analysis or frequency-domain analysis. However using time-frequency analysis this jump is very prominent due to its singularity. In this article, an online ESR estimation method of AEC is proposed by using the wavelet transform (WT) based time-frequency analysis. The relationship between ESR and the jump amount of output voltage at turn-off moments is analyzed first, and then the ESR calculation model is derived using WT with the wavelet basis of the first derivative of Gaussian function. An appropriate sampling interval for the output voltage and the inductor current is determined. Besides, the online ESR estimation scheme is implemented including the hardware and software designs. Furthermore, a prototype of boost PFC converter with 220 V ac input and 360 V dc output is built, where an average current mode control chip UC3854 is used. Four factors are discussed for estimation accuracy in the experiment, and the estimated results are consistent with the results measured by LCR meter with a relative error less than 10%.",Aluminum electrolytic capacitor (AEC); equivalent series resistance (ESR) estimation; time-frequency analysis; boost power factor correction (PFC) converter; wavelet transform (WT),"Lu, WG; Lu, XM; Han, JX; Zhao, ZY; Du, X",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS,10.1109/TPEL.2019.2957027,"[Lu, Weiguo; Lu, Xuemei; Han, Jinxin; Zhao, Zhaoyang; Du, Xiong] Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Power Transmiss Equipment & Syst Se, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,0885-8993,

However, the SiC-based devices have different failure modes and mechanisms compared with Si counterparts. Therefore, a comprehensive review is critical to develop accurate lifetime prediction and extension strategies for SiC power converter systems. The SiC power device component-level failure modes and mechanisms are first investigated. Different accelerated lifetime tests and component-level lifetime models are then compared. Power converter system-level offline lifetime modeling techniques and software tools are further summarized. Besides, the SiC power converter condition monitoring strategies and health indicators are surveyed. The online measurement challenges are also studied.

WoS,A Reduced-Switch-Count Family of Soft-Switched High-Frequency Inductive AC-Link Converters,"This article introduces a new family of partial-resonance high-frequency ac-link converters with a reduced number of switches, which contributes to enhanced reliability and reduced size. The proposed family of converters can be configured to interface various number of single-/multiport dc and/or single-/multiphase ac systems of sources and loads through a partial-resonance parallel LC link. The LC link is composed of a small inductor and a very small ac capacitor without the use of bulky and short life-cycle electrolytic capacitors. The high-frequency ac link is responsible for transferring power between different ports of the system entirely or partially as well as realizing zero voltage switching for all the power switches/diodes over the full load range, which results in minimized stress over the switches as well as low electromagnetic interference (EMI). This class of converters, which only employs two-quadrant switches, is inherently bidirectional with voltage step-up/step-down capability. It allows variable frequencies and power factors between the input and output terminals in one stage of power conversion. The proposed converters can function in buck-boost, buck, and/or boost modes of operation to step up and/or step down the input voltage. Functioning in buck or boost modes of operation can significantly reduce the link peak current and voltage, contributing to reduced power loss, size of components, voltage/current stress of power switches/diodes, and EMI. Furthermore, the proposed converters are robust against the open-circuit/short-circuit problems of input, output, and link inductors/capacitors, which place emphasis on improved reliability of the system. They are also capable of minimizing poor recovery issues and related losses of the body diodes of switches by using external fast recovery diodes in series with the main switching devices. In view of these features, this class of converters is expected to exhibit improved reliability, efficiency, power density, functionality, and flexibility compared to most existing power converters. A current modulation approach is also developed for each function to regulate the input and output currents on a switching cycle-by-cycle basis. A detailed performance analysis to investigate the challenges of each function in terms of frequency, power factor, and voltage amplitude is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed configurations along with the modulation schemes is verified theoretically using simulation software and experimentally via a low-power laboratory prototype at different operating conditions.",AC-AC converter; ac-dc converter; ac-link converter; high-frequency ac link; inverter; reduced switch count; reliability; three-phase; zero voltage switching (ZVS),"Mozaffari, K; Amirabadi, M",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS,10.1109/TPEL.2020.2965582,"[Mozaffari, Khalegh] Enphase Energy Inc, Austin, TX 78758 USA; [Amirabadi, Mahshid] Northeastern Univ, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Boston, MA 02115 USA",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,0885-8993,
WoS,Design and Fabrication of Three-Dimensional Printed Air-Core Transformers for High-Frequency Power Applications,"This article presents various designs of toroidal air-core transformers utilizing a 3-D printing and electroplating fabrication methodology. For certain applications and switching frequency regimes, limitations in core-based magnetics force circuit designers to use air-core components, which are conventionally wire-wound, and thus, constrained to simple structures with poor copper coverage. 3-D printing offers a solution to this constraint and provides more flexibility for transformer designs. This article includes design calculations, finite-element method (FEM) simulations, and loss analysis for three different toroidal transformer designs: one which features nested toroids, coupling their N-2 flux, the second which uses stacked toroids, coupling the one-turn flux, and the third which interleaves two windings. Furthermore, the manufacturing procedure presented in this article allows for accurate modeling of the transformer's inductance matrix, which is advantageous over hand-wound air-core components. Additionally, we provide experimental demonstrations, including the implementation of these transformers in 100-W, 30-MHz resonant converters. Lastly, COMSOL FEM design automation MATLAB scripts for the various inductors and transformers discussed in this article are publicly available in the paper by Z.

WoS,Information sensing application of integrated trauma first aid measurement model under trauma scoring system software in severe multiple injuries,"The thesis makes a comparative study on the treatment effect of patients with severe multiple injuries by the traditional specialist treatment measurement model and the integrated trauma first aid measurement model, with a view to providing a theoretical basis for the treatment of clinical multiple injury patients with a fast and effective treatment model. The paper takes the pre- and post-establishment measurement model in our hospital as a dividing point, retrospectively analyses the clinical data of 221 patients with severe multiple injuries, and divides the patients into a control group and a research group. Before the establishment, 129 patients with severe multiple injuries were treated with a specialist treatment model. The study group was 92 cases of patients with severe multiple injuries treated with the integrated trauma emergency mode; Our hospital trauma scoring system software used injury severity score (ISS) for patients with multiple injuries. Observation of in-hospital emergency time, length of stay, mortality, incidence of MODS, and incidence of shock in the two groups. The study found that the incidence of MODS, the incidence of shock, and the mortality of the study group were significantly lower than those of the control group after receiving the respective rescue modes, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The in-hospital emergency time in the study group was longer than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the average hospital stay time between the two groups (P > 0.05). Therefore, the integrated trauma first aid model moves the first aid resources forward and implements injury control in the early stage, which can significantly improve the prognosis of patients, reduce mortality, the incidence of MODS and the incidence of shock. It is an efficient and rapid treatment method. The clinical value is worthy of promotion and application. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Bioconversion of hazelnut shell using near critical water pretreatment for second generation biofuel production,"The global energy deficiency and depletion of fossil fuels have raised concerns leading to a wide scale examination of alternative and renewable energy sources. Lignocellulosic biomass that is one of the renewable energy sources has major potential in the world and it has a wide variety of sources including agricultural residues such as cotton stalk, corn stover, wheat straw, etc. Including over 65% cellulose and hemicelluloses content, these materials can be hydrolyzed into monomeric sugars and then can be converted into biofuels and other industrial products. The main objective of this study is bioethanol production with bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass, namely hazelnut shell. In order to efficiently utilize this raw material for ethanol production by degrading the lignocellulosic structure, an effective pretreatment is required. LHW, a near critical water pretreatment method, is chosen for this particular research due to its unique environmental and economic properties. The experiment design was prepared with Response Surface Estimation Method (RSM) by Design Expert software. The experiment parameters were selected as temperature (100-200 degrees C), pressure (80-200 bar) and flow rate (2-8 ml/min). The optimum condition (OC) for the process was determined as 138 degrees C, 2 ml/min and 200 bar according to the Dinitrosaliclic acid (DNS) method. Additionally, in order to achieve maximum ethanol concentration, the condition producing maximum reducing sugar content is determined. Separated hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process was used for bioethanol production. Enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted with a part of solid residue obtained from the maximum ethanol condition (MEC) for bioethanol production. MEC is 200 degrees C, 2 ml/min and 200 bar. Under MEC, at the end of the fermentation process maximum ethanol yield was 44.89% with 0.5 g of solid loading. The main purpose of the study is to determine the effects of different solid loading rates in the enzymatic hydrolysis stage of SHF process to ethanol production as a result of fermentation. There are several pretreatment methods for this process. It is concluded that the superior qualifies of LHW pretreatment in means of environmental friendliness, non-toxic and non-corrosive byproducts, water usage instead of other chemical additives, degradation of lignocellulosic structure and low cost were suitable for the intended purpose of bioethanol production using hazelnut shell.",Lignocellulosic; Hazelnut shell; LHW; Bioethanol; Enzymatic hydrolysis,"Uyan, M; Alptekin, FM; Cebi, D; Celiktas, MS",2020.0,Journal,FUEL,10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117641,"[Uyan, Merve; Alptekin, Fikret Muge; Cebi, Dilvin; Celiktas, Melih Soner] Ege Univ, Solar Energy Inst, TR-35100 Bornova, Turkey",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0016-2361,

WoS,Effects of remote ischemic preconditioning on prognosis in patients with lung injury: A meta-analysis,"Objective: A number of trials have shown that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) could reduce lung injury of patients suffering cardiovascular surgery, pulmonary transplantation surgery and thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation. However, there is still a controversy over the lung protection of RIPC in patients who suffers different types of surgery. We undertook meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning on clinical outcomes of patients with lung injury. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting: Perioperative care areas. Patients: Adults and infants suffering cardiovascular surgery with lung injury. Intervention: Remote ischemic preconditioning. Measurements: The literatures were selected complying with the inclusive and exclusive criteria from the following databases as PubMed, Embase, Medline, Chinese Biomedical Literature and Journal Databases, Chinese Academic and VIP journal full-text Databases. Inclusion criteria includes: (1) Human clinical randomized and controlled trial; (2) the article we included is a clinical randomized controlled study; (3) the article discusses the effect of RIPC on lung injury of patients; (4) the primary evaluation indicators of the inclusive studies included postoperative intensive care unit stay time and mechanical ventilation time; (5) published in the form of full text, any language; (6) the type of operation is cardiovascular surgery; (7) there is no serious COPD, ARDS, respiratory failure and other lung diseases. Articles were excluded if they reported none of the outcomes as follows: postoperative intensive care unit stay time and mechanical ventilation time, human clinical controlled trails, pulmonary protection of RIPC, prospective clinical controlled trials.

WoS,Facial-expression recognition: An emergent approach to the measurement of tourist satisfaction through emotions,"Purpose: The employment of facial-expression recognition to analyse emotions constitutes a potential instrument for the measurement of customer satisfaction in the tourism sector. The study aims to assess the functionality of Artificial Intelligence to measure tourists' emotions and hence their satisfaction with the quality of the service provided on a guided tour when visiting a UNESCO heritage site. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology comprises the following stages. Firstly, the emotions are analysed through data recorded by using a software application on facial-expression recognition on a sample of tourists visiting a heritage site. Secondly, the tourists were asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the guided tour visit. Finally, a structural equation modelling approach is used to validate the strong relation between emotions and satisfaction. Findings: The results achieved confirm that the information obtained from facial-expression recognition demonstrated that it is as valid an instrument as that offered by the self-administered questionnaires for the measurement of customer satisfaction. The findings from the application reveal that a change in the scientific and professional field is emerging in the measurement of customer satisfaction focused on the emotions from a digital approach. Research limitations/implications: This research is mainly based on the use of specific software for facial-expression recognition with its intrinsic measurement of emotions with and in a specific heritage scenario. Other scenarios and software of a more sophisticated nature implemented in the tourism and hospitality industry are necessary for the in-depth comprehension of the significant role played by emotions in the improvement of service quality. Practical implications: The recent application of recording emotions in the Tourism Industry provides practitioners with useful insights for the detection of deficiencies in their services and therefore the means to boost their reputation and destination image. Originality/value: Artificial Intelligence presents a new paradigm in the measurement of satisfaction by substituting self-administered surveys with a method based on the use of innovative software that recognizes faces and detects emotions through facial expressions.

WoS,The prisoner transportation problem,"Prisoners often require transportation to and from services such as hospital appointments, court proceedings and family visits during their imprisonment. Organising daily prisoners transportation consumes a huge amount of resources. A large fleet of highly protected vehicles, their drivers and security guards must be assigned to all prisoner transports such that all safety and time-related constraints are satisfied while inter-prisoner (inter-passenger) conflicts are avoided. It is beyond human planners' capabilities to minimize costs while attempting to feasibly schedule all prisoner transportation requests. Whereas the prisoner transportation problem (PTP) bears resemblance with vehicle routing, common software systems for vehicle routing fail to address the intricacies associated with the PTP. A dedicated decision support system is required to both support human planners as well as reduce operational costs. The considerable computational challenge due to problem-specific components (inter-passenger conflicts and simultaneous servicing) also makes the PTP interesting from an academic point of view. We formally introduce the problem by providing mixed integer programming models. We implement exact iterative procedures to solve these formulations and evaluate their performance on small instances. In order to solve instances of a realistic size, we present a heuristic. Academic PTP instances generated and employed for experimentation are made publicly available with a view towards encouraging further follow-up research. The heuristic presented in this paper provides all the necessary components to solve the PTP adequately and sets initial benchmarks for the new public instance set. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Atmospheric heating rate due to black carbon aerosols: Uncertainties and impact factors,"This study investigates the impacts of black carbon (BC) properties (vertical concentration, shape, size, and mixing state) and atmospheric variables (cloud and aerosol loading, surface albedo, and solar zenith angle) on BC radiative effects. Observations from aircraft measurements, lidar, and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) are used to constrain BC and aerosol properties. The library for radiative transfer (Libradtran) model is used to calculate BC radiative forcing (RF). BC optical properties are obtained from numerical modeling with aggregate or spherical structures and different size distributions. By modifying the optical properties, different BC geometries and size distributions result in uncertainties in RF and heating rate less than 30%, while the uncertainty in heating rate due to different BC mixing states is as large as similar to 80%. The vertical distribution of BC concentrations explains less than 10% of the relative differences in RF and heating rate in the atmosphere, but can induce different heating rate vertical profiles, thus different planetary boundary layer (PBL) stabilities. Due to the significant influence of cloudy and aerosol conditions on incident solar radiation, atmospheric conditions play an important role in determining the BC heating rate. Meanwhile, the effects of surface albedo and solar zenith angle on the BC heating rate are most significantly near the surface. Taking the above factors into account, we introduce an empirical approximation of the BC heating rate to estimate its influence on the atmosphere. With the simple formula, the BC heating rate for a particular atmospheric layer can be approximated when the vertical condition is known, and this can be further applied to determine whether BC promotes or suppresses PBL development. Considering the importance of the BC vertical concentration in its heating rate, we suggest that light-absorbing aerosols and their vertical distributions must be better measured and modeled to improve the understanding of their radiative effects and interaction with PBL.",Black carbon; Radiative forcing; Heating rate; Vertical distribution,"Lu, Q; Liu, C; Zhao, DL; Zeng, C; Li, J; Lu, CS; Wang, JD; Zhu, B",2020.0,Journal,ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.104891,"[Lu, Qiao; Liu, Chao; Lu, Chunsong; Zhu, Bin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Lu, Qiao; Liu, Chao; Lu, Chunsong; Wang, Jiandong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Aerosol Cloud Precipitat China Meteorol A, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Delong] Beijing Weather Modificat Off, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Chen] Suzhou Meteorol Bur, Meteorol Disaster Prevent Ctr, Suzhou 215000, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Peking Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,English,0169-8095,

In the framework of the European DEMO project, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is dedicating several efforts to the development of a multiphysics analysis tool allowing the characterization of breeding blanket design points which are consistent from the neutronic, thermal-hydraulic and thermal-mechanical points of view. In particular, a procedure developed at KIT is characterized by the implementation of analysis software only. A preliminary step for the validation of such a procedure has been accomplished using a dedicated model of the DEMO Helium Cooled Pebble Bed Blanket 4th outboard module. A global model representative of nuclear irradiation in DEMO and two local models have been set up. Nuclear power deposition and the spatial distribution of its volumetric density have been calculated using Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code for the aforementioned models and compared in order to validate the procedure set up.

WoS,"Explaining Differences in the Acceptability of 99DOTS, a Cell Phone-Based Strategy for Monitoring Adherence to Tuberculosis Medications: Qualitative Study of Patients and Health Care Providers","Background: 99DOTS is a cell phone based strategy for monitoring tuberculosis (TB) medication adherence that has been rolled out to more than 150,000 patients in India's public health sector. A considerable proportion of patients stop using 99DOTS during therapy. Objective: This study aims to understand reasons for variability in the acceptance and use of 99DOTS by TB patients and health care providers (HCPs). Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with individuals taking TB therapy in the government program in Chennai and Vellore (HIV-coinfected patients) and Mumbai (HIV-uninfected patients) across intensive and continuation treatment phases. We conducted interviews with HCPs who provide TB care, all of whom were involved in implementing 99DOTS. Interviews were transcribed, coded using a deductive approach, and analyzed with Dedoose 8.0.35 software (SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC). The findings of the study were interpreted using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, which highlights 4 constructs associated with technology acceptance: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influences, and facilitating conditions. Results: We conducted 62 interviews with patients with TB, of whom 30 (48%) were HIV coinfected, and 31 interviews with HCPs. Acceptance of 99DOTS by patients was variable. Greater patient acceptance was related to perceptions of improved patient-HCP relationships from increased phone communication, TB pill-taking habit formation due to SMS text messaging reminders, and reduced need to visit health facilities (performance expectancy); improved family involvement in TB care (social influences); and from 99DOTS leading HCPs to engage positively in patients' care through increased outreach (facilitating conditions). Lower patient acceptance was related to perceptions of reduced face-to-face contact with HCPs (performance expectancy); problems with cell phone access, literacy, cellular signal, or technology fatigue (effort expectancy); high TB- and HIV-related stigma within the family (social influences); and poor counseling in 99DOTS by HCPs or perceptions that HCPs were not acting upon adherence data (facilitating conditions). Acceptance of 99DOTS by HCPs was generally high and related to perceptions that the 99DOTS adherence dashboard and patient-related SMS text messaging alerts improve quality of care, the efficiency of care, and the patient-HCP relationship (performance expectancy); that the dashboard is easy to use (effort expectancy); and that 99DOTS leads to better coordination among HCPs (social influences). However, HCPs described suboptimal facilitating conditions, including inadequate training of HCPs in 99DOTS, unequal changes in workload, and shortages of 99DOTS medication envelopes. Conclusions: In India's government TB program, 99DOTS had high acceptance by HCPs but variable acceptance by patients. Although some factors contributing to suboptimal patient acceptance are modifiable, other factors such as TB- and HIV-related stigma and poor cell phone accessibility, cellular signal, and literacy are more difficult to address. Screening for these barriers may facilitate targeting of 99DOTS to patients more likely to use this technology.",tuberculosis; medication adherence; mobile phone; mHealth; implementation science; qualitative research,"Thomas, BE; Kumar, JV; Onongaya, C; Bhatt, SN; Galivanche, A; Periyasamy, M; Chiranjeevi, M; Khandewale, AS; Ramachandran, G; Shah, D; Haberer, JE; Mayer, KH; Subbaraman, R",2020.0,Journal,JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,10.2196/16634,"[Thomas, Beena E.; Kumar, J.

WoS,Motion estimation using variable size block matching with cross square search pattern,"In recent decades, motion estimation is a major concern in video coding applications. Among all existing techniques, block matching is an emerging technique in motion estimation, because of its simplicity and effectiveness for both hardware and software implementations. In addition, the block matching technique helps in choosing the motion vectors for every macro block instead of utilizing a motion vector for every pixel. In this research article, Variable Size Block Matching (VSBM) with cross square search pattern is proposed for motion estimation in the videos. Compared to other block matching methods, the VSBM results in a low motion compensation error and also significantly speed up the motion estimation process. For reducing the illumination change effect in the video frame, cross square search pattern is developed that prevents macro blocks from over-splitting. In this work, the proposed algorithm performance is analysed by using some real time videos like container, Akiyo, Stefan, kristen-sara, foreman, Johnny, old-town-cross, Carphone, football and crowd-run. From the analysis, the proposed algorithm results in maximum of 14.9 dB improvement in peak signal to noise ratio value as compared to existing algorithms; dynamic pattern (square, diamond and hexagon) and harmony search with block matching.",Cross square search pattern; Motion estimation in video; Sum of squared distance; Variable size block matching,"Senbagavalli, G; Manjunath, R",2020.0,Journal,SN APPLIED SCIENCES,10.1007/s42452-020-03248-2,"[Senbagavalli, G.; Manjunath, R.] AMC Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Bannerghatta Rd, Bangalore, India",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,English,2523-3963,

WoS,"Effects of methadone, opium tincture and buprenorphine maintenance therapies on thyroid function in patients with OUD","Various types of medications are used as maintenance therapies for substance use disorder; However, the side effects of these drugs are shown to restrict their use and increase the risk of relapse in patients. As a result, alternative maintenance therapies are tested in the hope for optimum therapy. Since opium tincture is a new and innovative maintenance treatment in Iran, we attempted to compare the therapeutic and side effects of opium tincture with two standard therapies, i.e., methadone and buprenorphine. Hence, thyroid function was tested in three methods of maintenance therapies with methadone, buprenorphine, and opium tincture in a cross-sectional study. In this study, 150 patients with the mean age of 51.63 +/- 13.56 years and a history of opioid or opioid-derivatives use disorder, underwent the maintenance treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, and opium tincture at Bojnurd Addiction Treatment Centers in northeastern Iran. These patients were selected using convenience sampling. Then, they were placed into three treatment groups of methadone, buprenorphine, and opium tincture. The thyroid functionality was assessed with measuring TSH, fT4, fT3, T3RU, and Anti TPO, carried out in a reference laboratory. Finally, these data were analyzed by ANOVA using SPSS.16 software. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the average levels of TSH, fT3, fT4, and Anti TPO in these treatment groups; except for T3RU concentration, which was increased significantly in the opium tincture group as compared to the methadone treated group. Also, the frequency of fT3, and Anti TPO disorders demonstrated a significant change in three groups.

WoS,Economic feasibility analysis and optimization of hybrid renewable energy systems for rural electrification in Peru,"The majority of rural communities in developing countries (such as Peru) are not connected to the electrical grid. Hybrid energy production from available renewable resources (e.g., wind and solar) and diesel engines is considered as an economically viable and environmentally friendly alternative for electrification in these areas. Motivated by the lack of a comprehensive investigation dedicated to the techno-economic analysis of hybrid systems (PV-wind-diesel) for off-grid electrification in Peru, the present work is focused on determining the optimal configuration of these systems for remote Peruvian villages. Three small communities without access to the grid (Campo serio, El potrero, and Silicucho), which are located in different climatic zones of Peru, have been accordingly selected as case studies. Seven different configurations including single component systems (solar, wind, and diesel) and hybrid ones are considered. While taking into account the meteorological data and load characteristics of the communities along with the diesel fuel's price and the cost of components, HOMER software is utilized to determine the optimal sizing of the system [resulting in the lowest net present cost (NPC)] considering different scenarios. The obtained configurations are then compared considering other state-of-the-art economic indices [initial capital cost, total annual operating cost, and the cost of energy (COE)], the generation fractions, and the resulting CO(2)emissions. The obtained results have revealed that, for all of the investigated communities, the hybrid solar-wind-diesel system is the most economically viable scenario. Considering the latter scenario, the obtained optimal configuration leads to an NPC of USD 227,335 (COE: 0.478 USD/kWh) for Campo serio, USD 183,851 (COE: 0.460 USD/kWh) for El potrero, and USD 146,583 (COE: 0.504 USD/kWh) for Silicucho. Furthermore, employing the optimal configurations a renewable fraction (with respect to the total generation) of 94% is obtained for Campo serio and Silicucho, while the achieved renewable fraction for El potrero is 97%. Moreover, for the case of Campo serio, the resulting CO(2)emission of the obtained optimal system is determined to be 6.1% of that of a diesel-only unit, while the latter ratio is determined to be 2.7% for El potrero and 9.9% for that of Silicucho. The optimal configurations that are obtained and presented in the present paper can be utilized as guideline for designing electrification systems (with a minimized cost) for the considered communities and other villages with similar characteristics (population and climatic conditions).

WoS,HOSS: an implementation of the combined finite-discrete element method,"Nearly thirty years since its inception, the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM) has made remarkable strides in becoming a mainstream analysis tool within the field of Computational Mechanics. FDEM was developed to effectively bridge the gap between two disparate Computational Mechanics approaches known as the finite and discrete element methods. At Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) researchers developed the Hybrid Optimization Software Suite (HOSS) as a hybrid multi-physics platform, based on FDEM, for the simulation of solid material behavior complemented with the latest technological enhancements for full fluid-solid interaction. In HOSS, several newly developed FDEM algorithms have been implemented that yield more accurate material deformation formulations, inter-particle interaction solvers, and fracture and fragmentation solutions. In addition, an explicit computational fluid dynamics solver and a novel fluid-solid interaction algorithms have been fully integrated (as opposed to coupled) into the HOSS' solid mechanical solver, allowing for the study of an even wider range of problems. Advancements such as this are leading HOSS to become a tool of choice for multi-physics problems. HOSS has been successfully applied by a myriad of researchers for analysis in rock mechanics, oil and gas industries, engineering application (structural, mechanical and biomedical engineering), mining, blast loading, high velocity impact, as well as seismic and acoustic analysis.

WoS,A study of vectorization for matrix-free finite element methods,"Vectorization is increasingly important to achieve high performance on modern hardware with SIMD instructions. Assembly of matrices and vectors in the finite element method, which is characterized by iterating a local assembly kernel over unstructured meshes, poses difficulties to effective vectorization. Maintaining a user-friendly high-level interface with a suitable degree of abstraction while generating efficient, vectorized code for the finite element method is a challenge for numerical software systems and libraries. In this work, we study cross-element vectorization in the finite element framework Firedrake via code transformation and demonstrate the efficacy of such an approach by evaluating a wide range of matrix-free operators spanning different polynomial degrees and discretizations on two recent CPUs using three mainstream compilers. Our experiments show that our approaches for cross-element vectorization achieve 30% of theoretical peak performance for many examples of practical significance, and exceed 50% for cases with high arithmetic intensities, with consistent speed-up over (intra-element) vectorization restricted to the local assembly kernels.",Finite element method; vectorization; global assembly; code generation,"Sun, TJ; Mitchell, L; Kulkarni, K; Klockner, A; Ham, DA; Kelly, PHJ",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS,10.1177/1094342020945005,"[Sun, Tianjiao; Kelly, Paul H.

WoS,The effectiveness of computer-based simulations for numerical methods in engineering,"Problem-solving and critical thinking are critical skills that engineers need to develop to be competitive and meet the requirements of the future job market. The use ofActive Learning(AL) strategies allows instructors to develop these skills in the students while completing the academic program contents. The purpose of this study is to design and implementALself-regulated activities developed in Virtual Learning environments and supported by computer simulations for the instruction of numerical methods. Through the use of a real-life engineering problem, in this case, the analysis of a vehicle suspension system, the simulation-based activity provided an environment for the students to analyze the effect of the parameters of numerical methods used to solve a set ofOrdinary Differential Equations(ODE). Students compared the solution obtained with numerical methods of different order and different levels of accuracy, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A control group and an experimental group were used to compare and assess the impact of the proposed learning strategy on the instruction of numerical methods. Students who participated in these activities showed a more profound comprehension and obtained higher grades. Through the use of technological tools for guided activities, students acquired and practiced varied technical concepts, compared different solutions, and analyzed how numerical methods could be used to solve complex engineering problems.

WoS,Validation of PATHFx 2.0: An open-source tool for estimating survival in patients undergoing pathologic fracture fixation,"Treatment decisions in patients with metastatic bone disease rely on accurate survival estimation. We developed the original PATHFx models using expensive, proprietary software and now seek to provide a more cost-effective solution. Using open-source machine learning software to create PATHFx version 2.0, we asked whether PATHFx 2.0 could be created using open-source methods and externally validated in two unique patient populations. The training set of a well-characterized, database records of 189 patients and thebnlearnpackage within R Version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), was used to establish a series of Bayesian belief network models designed to predict survival at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Each was externally validated in both a Scandinavian (n = 815 patients) and a Japanese (n = 261 patients) data set. Brier scores and receiver operating characteristic curves to assessed discriminatory ability. Decision curve analysis (DCA) evaluated whether models should be used clinically. DCA showed that the model should be used clinically at all time points in the Scandinavian data set. For the 1-month time point, DCA of the Japanese data set suggested to expect better outcomes assuming all patients will survive greater than 1 month. Brier scores for each curve demonstrate that the models are accurate at each time point. Statement of Clinical Significance: we successfully transitioned to PATHFx 2.0 using open-source software and externally validated it in two unique patient populations, which can be used as a cost-effective option to guide surgical decisions in patients with metastatic bone disease.",Bayesian statistics; PATHFx; postoperative survival; prognostic model,"Overmann, AL; Clark, DM; Tsagkozis, P; Wedin, R; Forsberg, JA",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH,10.1002/jor.24763,"[Overmann, Archie L.; Clark, DesRaj M.; Forsberg, Jonathan A.] USU Walter Reed Dept Surg, Orthopaed, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Tsagkozis, Panagiotis; Wedin, Rikard; Forsberg, Jonathan A.] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Dept Mol Med & Surg, Sect Orthopaed & Sports Med, Stockholm, Sweden; [Forsberg, Jonathan A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Baltimore, MD USA",WILEY,English,0736-0266,
WoS,Integration of LNG Regasification Process in Natural Gas-Fired Power System with Oxy-Fuel Combustion,"Oxy-fuel combustion power systems can utilize the cold energy released during the liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification to reduce the power consumption of CO2 capture, but the specific LNG cold energy consumption of CO2 capture is still too large. To recover more CO2 with the limited LNG cold energy at a low energy cost, a novel natural gas-fired oxy-fuel power system with the cascade utilization of LNG cold energy is proposed in this work, where the LNG cold energy could be sequentially utilized in the air separation unit and the CO2 recovery process. The new system is evaluated with the Aspen Plus software. The results show that the net electrical efficiency and the specific primary energy consumption for CO2 avoided (SPECCA) of the new system are comparable to those of the chemical looping combustion cycle, and superior to those of the conventional O-2/CO2 cycles. Moreover, the specific LNG needed for CO2 avoided (SLNCC) of the new system is more than 67.2% lower than the existing oxy-fuel power systems utilizing the LNG cold energy. Furthermore, it is found that the O-2 purity of 97.0 mol.% and the CO2 capture ratio of 97.0% are optimal conditions, because the SPECCA, the specific exergy consumption for CO2 avoided (SECCA) and the SLNCC are at the minimum of 1.87 GJ(LHV center dot tCO2)(-1), 2.60 GJ center dot t(CO2)(-1) and 1.88 t(LNG)center dot t(CO2)(-1), respectively.

Measurements and weld quality evaluation were carried out on welded specimens using the Winteria (R) software qWeld. One hundred nineteen specimens were produced, scanned, and fatigue tested until failure. The fracture surfaces have been investigated in order to find the location(s) for most probable point(s) of initiation. These data were then used to fit the proposed model parameters used to predict the point of initiation. Local weld geometry measurements were extracted from the predicted fracture initiation location(s) to analyse the correlation between local weld geometry and fatigue life.

WoS,Global-scale genetic structure of a cosmopolitan cold-water coral species,"When considering widely distributed marine organisms with low dispersal capabilities, there is often an implication that the distribution of cosmopolitan species is an artefact of taxonomy, constrained by the absence of characters for delimiting either sibling or cryptic species. Few studies have assessed the relationship among populations across the global range of the species' distribution, and the presence of oceanographic barriers that might influence gene flow among populations are underestimated. In this study, evolutionary and ecological drivers of connectivity patterns have been inferred among populations of the cold-water coralDesmophyllum dianthus, a common and widespread solitary scleractinian species, whose reproduction strategy and larval dispersal are still poorly unknown. The genetic structure ofD. dianthuswas explored using 30 microsatellites in 347 specimens from 13 localities distributed in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Results clearly reveal genetically differentiated populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (F-ST= 0.16,F-SC= 0.01,F-CT= 0.15,P-values highly significant), and Chilean and New Zealand populations with independent genetic profiles.

WoS,Thyrotropin-releasing hormone axonal varicosities appear to innervate dopaminergic neurons in the human hypothalamus,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has a critical role in the central regulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary, and subsequently, thyroid hormone secretion from the thyroid gland. In addition to its role in the regulation of HPT axis, TRH is a potent regulator of prolactin (PRL) secretion by stimulating PRL secretion either directly from lactotrophs or indirectly via its action on the tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons. In rodents, the TRH neurons which regulate TSH and thyroid hormone secretion, called hypophysiotropic TRH neurons, are in the medial subdivision of the parvicellular paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In humans, the PVN also contains a large population of TRH neurons, especially in its medial part, but the location of hypophysiotropic TRH neurons is not yet known. In addition to regulating TSH and PRL secretion, TRH also functions as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. In rodents and teleosts, TRH axons densely innervate TIDA neurons to inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) biosynthesis, neuronal firing, and dopamine turnover which may contribute to increasing PRL secretion. No such connections have been reported in humans, although dopaminergic neurons express TRH receptors and TRH also regulates PRL secretion. The objectives of this study were to map TRH-IR and TH-IR structures in the human hypothalamus with single-label light microscopic immunocytochemistry and study their interaction with double-label light microscopic immunocytochemistry. We show that TRH-IR nerve terminals densely surround TH-IR neurons (perikarya and dendrites) in the infundibulum of the human hypothalamus. The micrographs illustrating these juxtapositions were taken by Olympus BX45 microscope equipped with a digital camera and with 100X oil immersion objective. Composite images were created from the consecutive micrographs if the neurons were larger than the frame of the camera, using Adobe Photoshop software. As no gaps between TRH-IR and TH-IR elements were seen, these contacts may be functional synapses by which TRH regulates the activity of dopaminergic neurons and subsequently TSH and PRL secretion.",TRH; Dopamine; TH; Juxtaposition; Immunohistochemistry; Human hypothalamus; Catecholamines,"Dudas, B; Merchenthaler, I",2020.0,JournalEA,BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION,10.1007/s00429-020-02120-8,"[Dudas, Bertalan] Lake Erie Coll Osteopath Med LECOM, Neuroendocrine Org Lab NEO, Erie, PA 16509 USA; [Merchenthaler, Istvan] Univ Maryland Baltimore, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth & Anat & Neurobiol, 10 South Pine St MSTF 977, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1863-2653,
WoS,Effect of heat and moisture transfer on the growth of mould on the inner surface of walls: A case study in Dalian of China,"Due to the influence of outdoor climate and indoor human activities, the moisture accumulation of building enclosure structure will lead to the growth of mould on the interior surface of the wall, damage the building structure and endanger human health. Taking an office building in Dachangshan Island of Dalian, a cold area in North China, as an example, the outdoor relative humidity is high, and the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is large during the heating period, which is easy to cause the increase of moisture content of the enclosure structure and the growth of mould. This study focuses on the influence of the heat and moisture transfer characteristics of the office building wall on the growth process of mould on the interior surface of the building. The dominant fungi of indoor air and wall surface werePenicilliumandCladosporium.WUFI software was used to simulate the heat and moisture transfer and the growth process of mould on the inner surface of the wall. The results show that the relative humidity of the air micro layer on the inner wall surface of the office building reaches more than 80% at the beginning of heating period in November every year, the mould hypha grows significantly in December and brings pollution risk. Finally, the relative humidity drops below 70% after the heating period is over in April, and the mould stops growing. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the condensation interface in the wall structure during the heating period leads to the accumulation of water in the wall, which is then transmitted to the wall surface through the wall pores, thus increasing the moisture content. This method provides a r eliable way for the numerical simulation of indoor mould growth risk.",cold area of China; mould pollution; coupled heat and moisture transfer; WUFI prediction model; risk prediction,"Lv, Y; Liang, JY; Wang, BB; Zhang, XY; Yuan, WJ; Li, YM; Xie, JC",2020.0,JournalEA,BUILDING SIMULATION,10.1007/s12273-020-0666-6,"[Lv, Yang; Liang, Jingyi; Wang, Beibei; Zhang, Xueyan] Dalian Univ Technol, Coll Civil Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Wenjie; Li, Yimin] Dalian Univ Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Xie, Jingchao] Beijing Univ Technol, Sch Construct Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China",TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,English,1996-3599,

Firstly, the mining conditions of the working face are systematically introduced, and the influence of the fully mechanized top-coal caving face with large mining height mining conditions on the roof is analyzed. It is obtained that the direct roof collapses and forms an irregular upper direct roof and a regular lower direct roof. Large massive fine-grained sandstone above the working face are extruded into each other to form a semi-arched rock-gangue structure. The UDEC software is used to conduct numerical simulation to verify the initial caving step distance of the direct roof of the top coal, mudstone and fine-grained sandstone, and the broken structure of the roof of the fully mechanized top-coal caving face with large mining height under different propulsion lengths and the plastic zone and stress distribution of the roof are obtained. The research shows that: the first caving step distance of top coal is 14.52 m, the first caving step distance of mudstone is 24.06 m, and the first caving step distance of fine-grained sandstone is 47.83 m; in the special case of failure and instability of rock-gangue structure, the reasonable support strength P(T)of the support shall be no less than 1.13 MPa to meet the requirements of roof support.

EG metabolites can cause acidosis, fibrosis, and eventually cirrhosis in the liver. This study aimed to investigate the effect of EG on rat liver and to determine the quantitative values of the disintegration of reticular fibers (RF) in the liver with the dose duration and to investigate the changes by digital image analysis (DIA). For this purpose, Wistar albino rats were divided into control, and five different daily experimental groups. The control group received saline, and the experimental groups received EG. At the end of experiments, liver tissues of all euthanized rats were removed, and sections were taken, and RF was shown by silver staining. It was observed that the RF fragments in the experimental groups were less than the control group. DIA of RF fragments was then performed with Olympus cellSensDimension 1.15 software and number, area, and ROI% values of the fragments were determined. Statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference between control and all experimental groups. RF fragments showed first-order disintegration kinetics, mean disintegration rate constant, and half-time values were 0.1 day(-1)and 7 days, respectively.

WoS,Effect of Cooling Rate and Slag Modification on the Copper Matte in Smelting Slag,"The amount of copper flash smelting slag has increased during the recent years along with an increasing slag-to-metal ratio. During slag tapping, some copper sulfide is mechanically entrained. As a result, it is necessary to recover copper matte from the slag by suitable methods. At present, the most common way is slow, controlled cooling in a transfer ladle. However, research on the detailed effects of slow cooling and the function of slag modification is rare. This paper described experiments that were performed at different cooling rates (0.5, 1.5, 3, and 7 degrees C/min), with and without additive. A detailed characterization of the copper-rich phase and its particle size was subsequently made using SEM-EDS micrographs and image analysis software. With a decrease in cooling rate, the particle size of the copper-rich matte phase became larger. The addition of gypsum and carbon as a slag modifier affected the size of the copper-rich phase slightly, and its chemical composition was modified compared with the experiments without additive.",Slag cleaning; Ladle cooling; Copper matte; Image analysis,"Gao, X; Chen, Z; Shi, JJ; Taskinen, P; Jokilaakso, A",2020.0,JournalEA,MINING METALLURGY & EXPLORATION,10.1007/s42461-020-00274-x,"[Gao, Xiang; Chen, Zhuo] Cent South Univ, Sch Energy Sci & Engn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Shi, Junjie; Taskinen, Pekka; Jokilaakso, Ari] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, Espoo, Finland; [Shi, Junjie] Northeastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol Met Multimetall Mineral, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,2524-3462,

Moreover, they may be used as a tool for attacks against targets located out of the native Home Area Network (HAN).

Symptoms of attacks can be detected as anomalies in traffic model and recognized by a software agent run on Home Gateway. Although these anomalies are detected locally, it may help network provider to protect his resources as well as other resources of his clients. For that purpose, network operator should be able to recognize anomalies and correlate them on the network level. In this way, the network operator has the ability to protect both its own network and HANs of its clients. This article shows that Smart Home security might be coupled with the providers' network security policy. For that reason, security tasks should be performed both in HAN and providers' data center.

Results indicated that although the effect of pressure is not significant on reaction's production rates, an increase in temperature favors oxygen production in reverse deacon reaction and magnetite production in hydrolysis and lowers hydrogen production in the hydrolysis step. On the other hand, steam to chlorine (Cl-2) ratio is directly correlated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and oxygen production in reverse deacon reaction and hydrogen production in hydrolysis.

WoS,Flow-field analysis and pressure gain estimation of a rotating detonation engine with banded distribution of reactants,"The flow-field structure and pressure gain performance of a rotating detonation engine with banded distribution of reactants have been studied using two-dimensional numerical simulations. The reactants are premixed H-2/Air mixture. An unsteady reacting flow solver named rhoHLLCFoam is developed based on the open source software OpenFOAM. Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are solved with second order accuracy in space and time with Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact (HLLC) Riemann scheme. The solver resolves the combustion phenomena through finite rate chemistry reaction model with Arrhenius form of reaction rate by using O Conaire scheme. After checking the reliability of the solver, two sets of cases with various inlet-area ratios (psi) and equivalence ratios (phi) are conducted. The result shows that with psi< 1.0, the reactants in front of detonation waves present a discretely banded distribution which causes a series of reverse compression waves in flow-field. This paper estimates the specific impulse and specific thrust of combustion chamber. It's shown that these parameters increase with the promotion of psi. By calculating the area-averaged stagnation pressure along axial direction of combustion chamber, the pressure gain ratio (eta) of the rotating detonation engine is estimated. The result suggests that eta decreases dramatically with the reduction of psi. In order to achieve pressure gain, psi must be greater than 0.60. Moreover, the equivalence ratio should be around unity to obtain higher value of eta. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Experimental and thermodynamic study on SO2 reduction to elemental sulfur by activated coke and pyrolysis gas: Influence of the reaction atmosphere,"To develop a new process of sulfur recovery for activated coke desulfurization, reduction of sulfur dioxide by activated coke and pyrolysis gas from powder coke fast preparation system was studied experimentally and theoretically. The distribution of gas products in the experiment was measured by GC-MS analyzer and refinery gas analyzer, while the thermodynamic equilibrium data was calculated by the Factsage software. The activated coke presented great catalytic performance for SO2 reduction by CO and H-2. The reactivity of CO reducing SO2 was higher than that of H-2, and the two gaseous reducing agents were independent of each other during the reaction process. The effect of CO2 on SO2 reduction was slight, while the participation of H2O resulted in a significant decrease in S yield. The unsteady state experiment shows that the catalytic ability of activated coke did not affect by reaction between carbon and SO2, CO2 or H2O. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Such BMS is quite different from those of solid-state batteries, e.g. Li-ion ecc., due to the different battery structure and operating principle. The BMS is built around a desktop computer equipped with LabVIEW software and NI (National Instruments, US) Compact DAQ (Data AcQuisition) device, which results in a flexible and expandable system, with advanced programming features. The BMS in-house software is designed to provide the test-facility with SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) functions, that is, it receives processes and logs all acquired data generated by the thermo-fluid and electric dynamic probes which are needed to perform the subsequent analyses. The BMS also generates the feedback signals for controlling the experiments evolution according to advances strategies such as efficiency maximization.

WoS,Comparison of the Snellen and Spectrum LogMAR visual acuity charts in schoolgoing children,"Background: This article is part of a doctoral study conducted by Dr T.I. Metsing under the supervision of Dr W. Jacobs and Dr R. Hansraj. Aim: To investigate the equivalence of a standard Snellen chart to that of the Spectrum LogMAR chart amongst children of school-going age. Setting: The study was conducted through the University of Johannesburg, with data collected from the district of Ekurhuleni in the province of Gauteng, in South Africa. Methods: Visual acuity (VA) data on uncompensated distance was collected from three randomly selected schools in Cauteng from 206 children aged between 6 and 17 years (mean age and standard deviation of 10.13 +/- 2.45 years). Unaided monocular and binocular VAs were measured using the Snellen chart (SC) at 6 m and the Spectrum LogMAR chart (SLC) at 3 m. Data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software. Results: The mean VAs of both eyes (BE), right eye (RE) and left eyes (LEs) obtained using the SLC of 0.84 minutes (6/5), 0.91 (6/55) and 0.96 (6/5.8), respectively, fell within the normal ranges of 6/6 or better. The mean VA scores of BE, RE and LEs obtained using the SC were 1.07 min (6/6.4), 1.11 min (6/6.7) and 1.18 (6/7.1), respectively, and fell below 6/6. The difference in the mean VAs scores for the SC and SLC of BE, RE and LE were found to be statistically significant (p = 0.00). Conclusion: Monocular and binocular mean VAs for the SLC were found to be one line better than that for the SC. The slightly better performance of the SLC could be attributed to potential theoretical advantages of the LogMAR chart.",Snellen chart; Spectrum Eyecare Software; LogMAR chart; visual acuity; children of schoolgoing age; optotypes; vision screening,"Metsing, TI; Hansraj, R; Jacobs, W",2020.0,Journal,AFRICAN VISION AND EYE HEALTH JOURNAL,10.4102/aveh.v79i1.531,"[Metsing, Thokozile, I] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Optometry, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Hansraj, Rekha] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Dept Optometry, Durban, South Africa; [Jacobs, Wanda] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Nursing, Johannesburg, South Africa",AOSIS,English,0378-9411,
WoS,Refinement of pairwise potentials via logistic regression to scoreprotein-proteininteractions,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are ubiquitous and functionally of great importance in biological systems. Hence, the accurate prediction of PPIs by protein-protein docking and scoring tools is highly desirable in order to characterize their structure and biological function. Ab initio docking protocols are divided into the sampling of docking poses to produce at least one near-native structure, and then to evaluate the vast candidate structures by scoring. Concurrent development in both sampling and scoring is crucial for the deployment of protein-protein docking software. In the present work, we apply a machine learning model on pairwise potentials to refine the task of protein quaternary structure native structure detection among decoys. A decoy set was featurized using the Knowledge and Empirical Combined Scoring Algorithm 2 (KECSA2) pairwise potential. The highly unbalanced decoy set was then balanced using a comparison concept between native and decoy structures. The resultant comparison descriptors were used to train a logistic regression (LR) classifier. The LR model yielded the optimal performance for native detection among decoys compared with conventional scoring functions, while exhibiting lesser performance for the detection of low root mean square deviation decoy structures. Its deployment on an independent benchmark set confirms that the scoring function performs competitively relative to other scoring functions.

WoS,Optimal resource allocation for stochastic systems performance optimisation of control tasks undergoing stochastic execution times,"The problem addressed in this paper is the optimal allocation of a CPU to a number of software control tasks. Each task is used to implement a feedback controller for a linear and time invariant system and is activated with a fixed period. On every periodic activation, the task executes a job, which collects the output of the system, and produces the control values after executing for a random computation time. If a job's duration exceeds a deadline, then the job is cancelled and the control values are not updated. The systems to be controlled are affected by process noise. Therefore the performance of each control loop can be evaluated through the steady-state covariance of the system's state, which depends on the probability with which the task implementing the controller drops its jobs. We show that by making a proper choice for the scheduling algorithm, this probability can be straightforwardly computed as a function of the scheduling parameters. This observation enables the construction of a very efficient procedure for finding the scheduling parameters that attain the optimal tradeoff between the performance of the different control loops.",Real-time control; stochastic systems; hybrid systems; optimisation,"Fontanelli, D; Greco, L; Palopoli, L",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL,10.1080/00207179.2020.1798024,"[Fontanelli, Daniele] Univ Trento, DII Dipartimento Ingn Ind, Trento, Italy; [Greco, Luca] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, Cent Supelec, Lab Signaux & Syst, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Palopoli, Luigi] Univ Trento, DISI Dipartimento Ingn & Sci Informaz, Trento, Italy",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,English,0020-7179,

Identification of code smell is a necessary step for improving the software quality and reducing the maintenance effort. In this study, we introduce a bad smell prediction technique based on object- oriented software metrics that use Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. An open-source project, namely JHOTDRAW, was used as our dataset, for which values of object-oriented software metrics were calculated. Two feature selection methods- Random Forest Importance (RFI) and Information Gain (IG) were applied to extract the most relevant attributes for the prediction of code smells, namely, Feature envy, Dispersed coupling, refused parent bequest, and God class. The random-search algorithm was used to tune the parameters of Random Forest and Decision Tree. Results show that the best classification accuracy for Decision Tree was obtained at 99.13% for refused parent bequest code smells. Results also show that after using the Random Forest classifier, refused parent bequest smell was predicted with the best accuracy of 99.14%.

Based on the experimental results, the vibration control performance of TMD and the effects of earthquake characteristics were analysed. The results showed that TMD had efficient control effects on the transmission tower responses, but the control performance varied. Moreover, the vibration control performance was related to the earthquake types and decreased with the increase in excitation intensity. The vibration control performance along the height was also analysed comprehensively. Finally, the dynamic responses of the transmission tower model with TMD were simulated using the finite element software, ANSYS, which agreed well with the shaking table test results. Based on the finite element model, the effect of the damping ratio of TMD on the vibration control performance was determined through a parametric study, indicating that adding the damping ratio can improve the vibration control performance within a specific range.

WoS,exCTF simulator: Simulation tool for phase contrast transfer function for aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy,"Background The contrast transfer function (CTF) is an important principle in the field of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. It provides information on how the electron wave that interacted with a sample (in frequency domain) in an objective lens is transferred to the imaging system (in real space domain) depending on the effects of lens aberrations. Based on the CTF calculation, various useful results, such as the TEM instrumental information limit and optimal imaging condition, can be estimated. Recently, aberration-corrected TEM (AC-TEM) has been widely applied in various research fields for imaging at the nanoscale or atomic scale. To use AC-TEM effectively, a deep understanding of the complicated CTF with an electron wave controlled via an aberration corrector is required. Unfortunately, this complicated CTF is difficult to understand for most microscopists without the use of computational tools. In this study, we develop the extended CTF (exCTF) simulator to perform the full as well as simple CTF calculation. Findings We successfully developed the exCTF simulator, which can obtain more information than previously reported software. The exCTF simulator not only calculates the CTF for basic optical information that can be obtained in conventional TEM, but also can calculate the extended CTF with various aberrations (up to fifth order) for more detailed information obtained in advanced high-performance AC-TEM in one-dimensional and two-dimensional formats. The user interface of the simulator includes CTF calculation, saving, and edit functions for five graphs for different conditions, allowing for detailed comparative analysis. Conclusion We confirmed that the exCTF simulator produced reliable calculation data for various applications. The exCTF simulator made it easy to obtain instrumental performance information and demonstrated the influence of optical aberrations on the actual resolution of AC-TEM. Consequently, the proposed exCTF simulator is expected to be useful to microscopists as a simulation tool for electron microscopy and as a training tool for electron optics.",TEM; CTF; Simulator; Optical aberration; Aberration correction,"Lee, SC; Jeung, JM; Lee, SG; Kim, JG",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,10.1186/s40543-020-00231-9,"[Lee, Sang-Chul; Jeung, Jong-Man; Kim, Jin-Gyu] Korea Basic Sci Inst, Ctr Sci Instrumentat, Daejeon 34133, South Korea; [Lee, Sang-Gil] Korea Basic Sci Inst, Ctr Res Equipment, Daejeon 34133, South Korea",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,English,2093-3134,
WoS,Computational modeling of viscoplastic polymeric material response during micro-indentation tests,"The computational modeling of instrumented indentation tests used to characterize material properties is challenging. It is mainly due to the computational techniques demanded to couple the complex physical mechanisms involved, such as, for example, the time-dependent inelastic material response to loads during contact. Therefore, this work aims to simulate the mechanical response of the poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) during a micro-indentation test considering a viscoplastic material model, and a prescribed load approach, using the finite element method. Further, model validation is performed based on experimental data measured during the contact between the indenter and the PVDF. Numerical analyses were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics finite element software considering the loading scheme of the experimental tests of 800 mN/min rate during loading and unloading, and a 400 mN constant load, held by 30 s. Finally, a viscoplastic Chaboche constitutive model is presented considering two cases: (1) a perfectly plastic behavior, and (2) a nonlinear isotropic hardening behavior based on Voce and Hockett-Sherby exponential laws. While the latter models exhibit some discrepancy in capturing the experimental behavior, the former one has shown excellent agreement with the load-depth curves obtained experimentally, achieving the best fitting for the set of Chaboche parameters: A = 1 s(-1), n = 4.62 and sigma(ref) = 132 MPa. Moreover, several phenomenological features of viscoplastic behavior such as rate dependence, plastic flow (or creep) and stress relaxation were accurately provided by the Chaboche model when describing the behavior of the PVDF material.",Viscoplasticity; Polymers; Microindentation; Finite elements,"O'Connor, J; dos Santos, BB; Borges, L; da Costa, MF; Castello, DA",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING,10.1007/s40430-020-02511-2,"[O'Connor, Joan; Borges, Lavinia; Castello, Daniel Alves] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ, Dept Mech Engn, PEM,COPPE, POB 68503, BR-21945970 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [dos Santos, Bianca Bastos; da Costa, Marysilvia Ferreira] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ, Met & Mat Engn Dept, PEM,COPPE, BR-21941598 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1678-5878,
WoS,"The effects of bush control methods on encroaching woody plants in terms of die-off and survival in Borana rangelands, southern Ethiopia","A study on the effect of bush control methods on encroaching woody species, namelyAcacia drepanolobium,Acacia melliferaandAcacia reficienswas conducted for a 2 years' time. A 3 ha of land was divided into two plots. Each replication with an area of 300 m x 50 m was again sub-divided into six plots (each 50 m x 50 m) to accommodate six treatments. Bush control treatments were assigned randomly to the plots and replicated two times across sites of similar topography. During the post-treatment period, responses of woody species to different treatments in terms of mortality and coppicing were monitored. Data was analysed using R software and Tukey's studentized range tests for comparisons of means. The applied treatments significantly influenced (P < 0.05) encroaching woody species. The finding showed that five out of the six bush control treatments greatly promoted woody mortality, however with species-specific differences. The stem-burning, tree cutting with fire-browse combination, cutting and fire, cutting and browsing, and cutting treatments greatly increased species mortality compared to the control treatment. Responses due to treatment effect also varied significantly (P < 0.05) among encroaching woody species. Accordingly, mortality was higher inA. reficiensthan in the other two species, indicating thatA. reficiensis greatly susceptible to the applied treatments.

WoS,Functional genetic diversity of domestic and wild American mink (Neovison vison),"The release of domestic organisms to the wild threatens biodiversity because the introduction of domestic genes through interbreeding can negatively impact wild conspecifics via outbreeding depression. In North America, farmed American mink (Neovison vison) frequently escape captivity, yet the impact of these events on functional genetic diversity of wild mink populations is unclear. We characterized domestic and wild mink in Ontario at 17 trinucleotide microsatellites located in functional genes thought to be associated with traits affected by domestication. We found low functional genetic diversity in both mink types, as only four of 17 genes were variable, yet allele frequencies varied widely between captive and wild populations. To determine whether allele frequencies of wild populations were affected by geographic location, we performed redundancy analysis and spatial analysis of principal components on three polymorphic loci (AR, ATN1 and IGF-1). We found evidence to suggest domestic release events are affecting the functional genetic diversity of wild mink, as sPCA showed clear distinctions between wild individuals near mink farms and those located in areas without mink farms. This is further substantiated through RDA, where spatial location was associated with genetic variation of AR, ATN1 and IGF1.",domestication; functional gene; introgression; mink; mustela; Neovison vison,"Morris, KY; Bowman, J; Schulte-Hostedde, A; Wilson, PJ",2020.0,JournalEA,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,10.1111/eva.13061,"[Morris, Kimberley Y.; Bowman, Jeff; Wilson, Paul J.] Trent Univ, Environm & Life Sci Grad Program, 2140 East Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9L 1Z8, Canada; [Bowman, Jeff] Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Wildlife Res & Monitoring Sect, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Schulte-Hostedde, Albrecht] Laurentian Univ, Dept Biol, Sudbury, ON, Canada; [Wilson, Paul J.] Trent Univ, Dept Biol, Peterborough, ON, Canada",WILEY,English,1752-4571,
WoS,Quadrotor UAV Position and Altitude Tracking Using an Optimized Fuzzy-Sliding Mode Control,"Quadrotors are one of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that have many applications in the aerospace industries which require a high level of accuracy and innovation in control and stability. In this paper, a hybrid control structure is proposed for this system. The sliding mode controller (SMC) is the foundation of this control structure. This controller, despite its high stability capability for nonlinear systems, has two weaknesses: chattering phenomenon and high vulnerability to noise. The proposed solution is to incorporate the SMC and the Fuzzy intelligent controller because of its high flexibility against the changes in the system model conditions. The new Fuzzy-SMC resolves the SMC weaknesses significantly, but it is not optimized due to a lack of access to the system model expert information. In order to optimize the Fuzzy-SMC, it is necessary to have accurate structural information and specification of the system model which are not available for this case. The final proposed solution is to synthesize the Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Fuzzy-SMC.

WoS,Latency estimation for chronic disease risk: a damped exponential weighting model,"Identifying the susceptible period when environmental factors affect disease risk is essential for understanding disease etiology. Most existing epidemiologic studies use oversimplified summaries of time-dependent exposures such as baseline or most current exposure, or the cumulative average of exposure over available follow-up periods. In this paper, we introduce a damped exponential weighting model for estimating optimal exposure weights for different time intervals. This model can accommodate flexible patterns of weights and can be fit using standard software. We applied the model to assess the latency of BMI and alcohol for post-menopausal breast cancer based on 30-year exposure history in the Nurses' Health Study. We have also performed a simulation study to assess the validity of the proposed hypothesis testing and estimation procedures in realistic conditions. We found that the type I error is close to 0.05; the bias in our parameter estimates is low and the coverage probability of interval estimates is close to 0.95. For ER+/PR+ breast cancer we found that recent BMI was a more important predictor of risk than more distant BMI; for ER-/PR- breast cancer, no latency was found and risk was characterized by cumulative high levels of BMI over a long period of time. For alcohol intake, we saw a strong positive association with cumulative intake for ER+/PR+ breast cancer; no significant association was found for cumulative intake or for any latency measure of risk for ER-/PR- breast cancer. Our results underscore the value of an easy-to-implement approach to latency analysis of exposure profiles for chronic disease.",Cancer; Damped exponential weights; Latency; Repeated exposure measurement,"Michels, K; Song, MY; Willett, WC; Rosner, B",2020.0,JournalEA,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,10.1007/s10654-020-00658-9,"[Michels, Karin] UCLA, Dept Epidemiol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Song, Mingyang] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Clin & Translat Epidemiol Unit, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Song, Mingyang; Willett, Walter C.; Rosner, Bernard] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Song, Mingyang] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Gastroenterol, Boston, MA USA; [Song, Mingyang; Willett, Walter C.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA USA; [Song, Mingyang; Willett, Walter C.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA USA; [Willett, Walter C.; Rosner, Bernard] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Channing Div Network Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rosner, Bernard] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA",SPRINGER,English,0393-2990,
WoS,Screening and evaluation of the stability of expression of reference genes in Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) using qRT-PCR,"The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) has rapidly become the most sensitive and accurate method for the quantitative analysis of gene expression. Normalization of gene expression to that of relatively stably expressed housekeeping genes is required to facilitate the study of gene expression and to obtain more accurate RT-PCR data. However, no studies of the stability of expression of housekeeping genes in Lymantria dispar have been reported. In the present study, BestKeeper, GeNorm and NormFinder statistical software was used to evaluate the expression of thirteen candidate reference genes in L. dispar under different conditions. The expression levels of candidate reference genes were determined for two biological factors (developmental stages and tissues) and four abiotic treatments (temperature, insecticide, CO2 and starvation). The results showed that the best candidate reference genes in L. dispar were TUB, AK, RPS15 for developmental stages, RPL32 and GAPDH for tissues, ACTB and EF1-alpha for CO2 stress, GAPDH and RPL32 for temperature stress, RPS3 and GAPDH for insecticide stress, and GAPDH and RPS3 for starvation stress. In summary, EF1-alpha and TUB are preferential housekeeping genes in L. dispar under various conditions.

WoS,Fumonisin B-1 induces toxicity in human leukocytes at low concentrations: Are computational studies effective to determine biosafety?,"Fumonisin B-1 is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium proliferatum found in various crops, particularly maize. Besides carcinogenicity, other manifestations have been registered in different animals and in humans. In the case of humans, epidemiological studies have reported high prevalence of esophageal cancer in populations exposed to fumonisins. This study aimed to evaluate the minimum concentration of FB1 capable of inducing cytotoxicity (cell viability test), genotoxicity (comet assay) and mutagenicity (micronucleus) in cultured human leukocytes and to evaluate the effectiveness of in silico tests to predict FB1 toxicity. All concentrations analyzed (200; 100; 50; 5; 0.5; 0.05; 0.005 mu g/mL and 300; 30; 3; 1; 0.1; 0.01 fg/mL) except the lowest demonstrated dose-dependent toxicity in all parameters analyzed (p < 0.05 to p < 0.0001). As for predictions, only the Lazar software showed carcinogenicity of FB1 for rats. Thus, it is evident that FB1 is able to induce dose-dependent damage at low concentrations, and that computational tests, although desirable for prediction, are not effective as biological tests to determine toxicity, at least of FB1 and within the experimental conditions tested.",FB1; Cytotoxicity; Genetic damage; Human leukocytes,"Kaminski, TFA; Dalla Lana, DF; Quintana, LD; Schmitt, EG; Kaminski, TA; Paula, FR; Fuentefria, AM; Machado, MM; de Oliveira, LFS",2020.0,Journal,TOXICON,10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.04.100,"[Andrzejewski Kaminski, Tais Fernanda; Fuentefria, Alexandre Meneghello] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Farmaceut, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Dalla Lana, Daiane Flores] Univ Fed Ciencias Saude Porto Alegre, Programa Posgrad Patol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Quintana, Luciane Dias; Schmitt, Elizandra Gomes] Univ Fed Pampa, Fac Farm, Uruguaiana, RS, Brazil; [Kaminski, Tiago Andre] Univ Fed Pampa, Itaqui, RS, Brazil; [Paula, Favero Reisdorfer; Machado, Michel Mansur; Souza de Oliveira, Luis Flavio] Univ Fed Pampa, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Farmaceut, Uruguaiana, RS, Brazil",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0041-0101,
WoS,Modified the smeared crack constitutive model of fiber reinforced concrete under uniaxial loading,"The addition of randomly distributed short fiber in the plain concrete can significantly improve the compressive and tensile properties. Herein, a modified smeared crack constitutive model for the fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) is proposed for the simulation of the mechanical behavior under uniaxial loading. In this model, the two-phase composite law is introduced to modify the elastic stiffness matrix. For the conditions of compression, the FRC is considered as the simple composite which follows the two-phase composite law and the smeared crack model. When the tensile crack occurs, the fiber-bridging plays an important role in the post-cracking behavior. The model considers the plastic deformation as the interfacial slip displacement of the fiber, and employs the bond-slip model to simulate interfacial debonding and fiber pullout. The constitutive model is achieved by the Fortran code in the user subroutines (Umat) of the finite element software Abaqus. The comparison between the numerical simulation results and experimental data under uniaxial loading shows that the model simulates the mechanical properties behavior of FRC with good accuracy.

WoS,Mechanical properties and meso-structure response of cemented gangue-fly ash backfill with cracks under seepage- stress coupling,"Seepage and cracks are two important factors affecting the stability of the cemented gangue-fly ash backfill (CGFB, a mixture of coal gangue, fly ash, cement and water). In this study, the CGFB samples with a 45 degrees single crack were prepared and the mechanical properties of CGFB with cracks under different seepage water pressures were studied. Based on the theory of damage mechanics, the damage variable which can evaluate the seepage effect and crack effect was introduced, and the damage evolution law of CGFB with cracks under the seepage-stress coupling was discussed. The research hat: The mechanical properties of CGFB with cracks under seepage-stress coupling are mainly determined by the seepage water pressure, prefabricated crack and their coupling effects. Seepage and crack aggravate the attenuation of the peak strength and elastic modulus of CGFB, but with the increase of seepage water pressure, the deterioration effect of the crack weakens. Seepage and crack have significant effects on the damage of CGFB. Finally, based on the discrete element software, damage mechanism of CGFB with cracks under seepage-stress coupling was analyzed from a microscopic perspective. The research results can lay a foundation for the long-term stability analysis and instability prediction of CGFB with geological defects such as joints and cracks in water-rich mines.

The results of the main measured material properties bricks, stones and lime plaster (taken from the envelope of the building in Cahors) are presented. The emphasis is on hygrothermal characterization. Structural characterizations are addressed as well as data on physicochemical and mechanical aspects. The results on the variations of the properties identified are discussed. The age, mineralogical composition, manufacturing process, moisture content and prevailing environmental conditions are all parameters that cause these variations and contribute to the state of preservation of ancient materials. The identified properties of the materials will serve as inputs to the software and models intended to characterize the behaviour of envelopes of ancient buildings.

WoS,Frontal lobe metabolic alterations characterizing Parkinson's disease cognitive impairment,"Background and purpose Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) cognitive impairment at early stages is challenging compared to the stage of PD dementia where functional impairment is apparent and easily diagnosed. Hence, to evaluate potential early stage cognitive biomarkers, we assessed frontal lobe metabolic alterations using in vivo multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI). Method Frontal metabolism was studied in patients with PD with normal cognition (PD-CN) (n = 26), with cognitive impairment (PD-CI) (n = 27), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 30) using a single slice (two-dimensional)H-1-MRSI at 3 T. The acquired spectra were post-processed distinctly for voxels corresponding to the bilateral middle/superior frontal gray matter (GM) and frontal white matter (WM) regions (delineated employing neuromorphometrics atlas) using the LC-Model software. Result Significant (post hocp < 0.016) reduction in the concentration ofN-acetyl aspartate (NAA) in the middle and superior frontal GMs and total choline (tCho) and total creatine (tCr) in the frontal WM was observed in PD-CI compared to PD-CN and HC, while that in HC and PD-CN groups were comparable. The NAA and tCr/tCho metabolite concentrations showed significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations with cognitive test scores in the frontal GM and WM, respectively. The receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis revealed significant (p < 0.05) area under curve for NAA/tNAA in the frontal GM and tCho in the frontal WM. Conclusion The frontal metabolic profile is altered in cognitively impaired PD compared with cognitively normal PD. Neuronal function loss (NAA), altered energy metabolism (Cr), and cholinergic (Cho) neural transmission are implicated in PD cognitive pathology.

WoS,Decoding incidental ovarian lesions: use of texture analysis and machine learning for characterization and detection of malignancy,"Purpose To compare CT texture features of benign and malignant ovarian lesions and to build a machine learning model to detect malignancy in incidental ovarian lesions. Methods In this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study, 427 consecutive patients with incidental ovarian lesions detected on contrast-enhanced CT (348, 81.5% benign and 79, 18.5% malignant) were included. The following CT texture features were analyzed using commercially available software (TexRAD, Feedback Plc, Cambridge, UK): total pixel, mean, standard deviation (SD), entropy, mean value of positive pixels (MPP), skewness, kurtosis and entropy. Three machine learning models were created by combining texture features and patients' age, and performance of these models was assessed using tenfold cross-validation. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were constructed to assess sensitivity and specificity. The cutoff value was picked using a cost-weighted method. Results Total pixels, mean, SD, entropy, MPP, and skewness were significantly different between benign and malignant groups (p < 0.05). With a selected 10 as a cost factor to optimize cutoff value selection, sensitivity 92%, specificity 60% in the random forest (RF) model, sensitivity 91%, specificity 69% in SVM model, and sensitivity 92%, specificity 61% in the logistic regression, respectively.

WoS,High-throughput field-programable gate array implementation of the advanced encryption standard algorithm for automotive security applications,"Connected smart vehicles in automotive industries have increased, resulting in high vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and vehicle-to-cloud connectivity. Increased data rates are required to achieve high bandwidth requirements to support such communication networks. Despite having numerous advantages, high connectivity between devices poses threats to vehicle and human security, rendering encryption critical before transmitting data across vehicular networks. Advanced encryption standard (AES) is commonly used for data encryption in automotive microcontrollers. Owing to modern digital design complexities, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are attracting attention for pre-silicon verification and software development. Owing to their parallel architectures, FPGAs are ideal for prototyping automotive designs running encryption algorithms, like AES at real-time data rates. Moreover, because they are reconfigurable, prototyping results of different implementation choices can be verified at an early stage, thereby helping architects and designers with forthcoming optimal designs. FPGAs also serve as platforms to develop software considerably before silicon arrives, thereby decreasing the time to market. Herein, we propose a high-throughput FPGA implementation of the AES algorithm for automotive microcontrollers using a 128-bit key created via Vivado high-level synthesis (HLS) tool. We use HLS design method based on application-specific bit widths to implement the design on FPGA.

After reviewing the mathematical model of the geometry, we present the formulation of hexahedral finite elements that represent a generalization of classical shell finite elements, in which also the thickness direction can be curvilinear. These finite elements are equivalent to the widely-used continuum mechanics based solid finite elements, but the adoption of local curvilinear reference system will allow in future works to apply mixed methods, such as the Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components (MITC), to contrast the locking phenomenon in the three spatial directions. For the assessment of the present elements, we consider different examples of curved geometries: cylindrical, conical, toroidal and spherical.

Comprehensive meta-analysis software was used for analysis. Results Twenty four eligible articles were included in the systematic review. Based on the baseline(18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging, the pooled hazard ratios of MTV, SLR, SUV/SULmax, SUV/SULpeak, and TLG for overall survival (OS) were 1.777 (95%CI: 1.389-2.275,p < 0.001), 3.425 (95%CI: 1.707-6.869,p = 0.001), 0.941 (95%CI: 0.599-1.477,p = 0.791), 1.704 (95%CI: 1.253-2.316,p = 0.016), and 1.755 (95%CI: 1.315-2.342,p < 0.001), respectively. The conventional and modified response assessment criteria exhibited a pooled sensitivity of 64% (95%CI: 46-79%) and 94% (95%CI: 81-99%) and a pooled specificity of 80% (95%CI: 59-93%) and 84% (95%CI: 64-95%), respectively, for the early(18)F-FDG PET/CT scan.

WoS,Teaching forward kinematics in a robotics course using simulations: transfer to a real-world context using LEGO mindstorms (TM),"Previous studies show that traditional teaching methods such as oral explanations and PowerPoint presentations can be complemented with the use of computer simulations in problem-solving sessions to teach robotics. Nevertheless, these previous works rest upon the assumption that the knowledge that is learned in virtual laboratories transfers to its equivalent real task. The main contribution of this work is to validate that the knowledge obtained by students in an undergraduate robotics course using computer simulations of 3D model robots can be applied to its real-world context. The experimental platform used to run the computer simulations was based on the Simscape Multibody library of the MATLAB (TM) software. Results show a satisfactory knowledge transfer because more than 75% of the students finished a forward kinematics problem using a physical manipulator built with LEGO Mindstorms (TM). In addition, the observation analysis of the professor reveals that students reinforced their knowledge previously learned, and their problem-solving and critical thinking skills also improved. In this way, this study demonstrates that the proposed methodology not only helps the transfer of knowledge to the real-world context but also helps to develop student competencies. Future work is needed to replicate the findings in other robotics topics, such as the generation of trajectories, the analysis of the dynamics of manipulators, and the design of various controllers for the actuators of the robot.",Educational platforms; Teaching strategy; Computer simulations; Educational innovation,"Gonzalez-Garcia, S; Rodriguez-Arce, J; Loreto-Gomez, G; Montano-Serrano, VM",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING - IJIDEM,10.1007/s12008-020-00670-z,"[Gonzalez-Garcia, Salvador] Tecnol Monterrey, Ave Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, NL, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Arce, Jorge; Montano-Serrano, Victor M.] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Toluca, Edo De Mexico, Mexico; [Loreto-Gomez, Gerardo] Inst Tecnol Super Uruapan, Uruapan, Michoacan, Mexico",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1955-2513,
WoS,Optimal design of compact microwave fractional order differentiator,"This paper presents a stable, accurate and wideband microwave fractional order differentiator (MFOD) based on infinite impulse response filter. The fractional order differentiator (FOD) design problem is formulated in the z-domain. This formulation alliances with the transmission line elements in cascading. Real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) are applied to determine the optimum values of the characteristic impedances of the transmission line elements. The performance measure criterion of CSA algorithm as compared with other nature inspired algorithms-based differentiator are carried by the magnitude response, absolute magnitude error, phase response, pole-zero response, percentage improvement graph and convergence rate. The simulation and statistical analysis clearly affirm that the proposed MFOD using CSA outperforms RCGA and PSO in all state-of-the-art. The absolute magnitude error for the designed fifth order is as low as 2.9022. The designed fractional order differentiator is implemented in the form of microstrip on RT/Duroid substrate with dielectric constant 2.2 and thickness 0.762 mm. that is eligible for wideband microwave differentiator.

WoS,The confined primal integral: a measure to benchmark heuristic MINLP solvers against global MINLP solvers,"It is a challenging task to fairly compare local solvers and heuristics against each other and against global solvers. How does one weigh a faster termination time against a better quality of the found solution? In this paper, we introduce the confined primal integral, a new performance measure that rewards a balance of speed and solution quality. It emphasizes the early part of the solution process by using an exponential decay. Thereby, it avoids that the order of solvers can be inverted by choosing an arbitrarily large time limit. We provide a closed analytic formula to compute the confined primal integral a posteriori and an incremental update formula to compute it during the run of an algorithm. For the latter, we show that we can drop one of the main assumptions of the primal integral, namely the knowledge of a fixed reference solution to compare against. Furthermore, we prove that the confined primal integral is a transitive measure when comparing local solves with different final solution values. Finally, we present a computational experiment where we compare a local MINLP solver that uses certain classes of cutting planes against a solver that does not. Both versions show very different tendencies w.r.t. average running time and solution quality, and we use the confined primal integral to argue which of the two is the preferred setting.",MINLP; Optimization software; Performance measure,"Berthold, T; Csizmadia, Z",2020.0,JournalEA,MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING,10.1007/s10107-020-01547-5,"[Berthold, Timo] Fair Isaac Germany GmbH, Takustr 7, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Csizmadia, Zsolt] Fair Isaac Europe Ltd, Int Sq,Starley Way, Birmingham B37 7GN, W Midlands, England",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,0025-5610,
WoS,Thrombin alters the synthesis and processing of CYR61/CCN1 in human corneal stromal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts through multiple distinct mechanisms,"Purpose: Previous research in our laboratory indicated that prothrombin and other coagulation enzymes required to activate prothrombin to thrombin are synthesized by the cornea and that apoptotic human corneal stromal cells can provide a surface for prothrombin activation through the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways. The purpose of the work reported here is to study the role of thrombin activity in the regulation of matricellular protein Cyr61 (CCN1) produced by wounded phenotype human corneal stromal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Methods: Stromal cells from human donor corneas were converted to defined wounded phenotype fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with fetal bovine serum, followed by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta-1), respectively, and stimulated with varying concentrations (0-10.0 units (U)/ml) of thrombin from 1-7 h. Cyr61 transcript levels were determined using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) while protein forms were analyzed using western blot data. Protease activities were characterized via protease class- specific inhibitors and western blot analysis. Thrombin activity was quantified using the fluorogenic peptide Phe-Pro-Arg-AFC. Protease-activated receptor (PAR) agonist peptides-1 and -4 were used to determine whether cells increased Cyr61 through PAR signaling pathways. The PAR-1 antagonist SCH 79797 was used to block the thrombin cleavage of the receptor. PCR data were analyzed using MxPro software and western blot data were analyzed using Image Lab (TM) and Image J software. Student t test and one- and two-way ANOVA (with or without ranking, depending on sample distribution), together with Dunnett's test or Tukey comparison tests for post-hoc analysis, were used to determine statistical significance. Results: Full-length Cyr61 is expressed by human corneal stromal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and is significantly upregulated by active thrombin stimulation at the message (p<0.03) and protein (p<0.03) levels for fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Inhibition by the allosteric thrombin-specific inhibitor hirudin prevented the thrombin-associated increase in the Cyr61 protein expression, indicating that the proteolytic activity of thrombin is required for the increase of the Cyr61 protein level. PAR-1 agonist stimulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts significantly increased cell-associated Cyr61 protein levels (p<0.04), and PAR-1 antagonist SCH 79797 significantly inhibited the thrombin stimulated increase of Cyr61 in fibroblasts but not in myofibroblasts. In the fibroblast and myofibroblast conditioned media, Cyr61 was detected as the full-length 40 kDa protein in the absence of thrombin, and mainly at 24 kDa in the presence of thrombin at >= 0.5 U/ml, using an antibody directed toward the internal linker region between the von Willebrand factor type C and thrombospondin type-1 domains. Although known to undergo alternative splicing, Cyr61 that is synthesized by corneal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts is not alternatively spliced in response to thrombin stimulation nor is Cyr61 directly cleaved by thrombin to generate its 24 kDa form; instead, Cyr61 is proteolytically processed into 24 kDa N- and 16 kDa C-terminal fragments by a thrombin activated leupeptin-sensitive protease present in conditioned media with activity distinct from the proteolytic activity of thrombin. Conclusions: In cultured human corneal stromal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, thrombin regulates Cyr61 through two mechanisms: 1) thrombin increases the Cyr61 expression at the message and protein levels, and 2) thrombin increases the activation of a leupeptin-sensitive protease that stimulates the cleavage of Cyr61 into N- and C-terminal domain populations in or near the thrombospondin type-1 domain. Generation of Cyr61 peptides during corneal injury stimulation may reveal additional functions of the protein, which modulate corneal wound healing activities or decrease activities of the full-length Cyr61 form.",,"Andreae, EA; Warejcka, DJ; Twining, SS",2020.0,Journal,MOLECULAR VISION,,"[Andreae, Emily A.; Warejcka, Debra J.; Twining, Sally S.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Biochem, 8701 Watertown Plank Rd, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Andreae, Emily A.] Marshfield Clin Res Inst, Marshfield, WI USA; [Twining, Sally S.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Ophthalmol, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA",MOLECULAR VISION,English,1090-0535,
WoS,Deformation Behavior of Superalloy Powder Compact under Hot Isostatic Pressing,"Herein, the deformation behavior of a superalloy powder compact under hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is investigated by implementing an elastic-plastic constitutive model into the finite element analysis software MSC Marc. The coefficients of the constitutive model are obtained from interrupted HIP experiments. Finite element calculation results for the shape change of the powder compact under HIP agree well with the experimental results. Isothermal HIP and containerless HIP, both of which are based on finite element simulations, are conducted to study the dependence of the deformation on the container and temperature gradient. The stress state in all of the regions in the powder body deviates from the isostatic state of the compact even under isostatic pressing, due to the introduction of von Mises stress under the strong influence of the container. The temperature gradient is affected by the characteristic thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of the porous powder body and container. Nonuniform temperature and stress distribution result in nonuniform densification, which eventually results in uneven powder compact shrinkage.",constitutive models; deformation; finite element analyses; hot isostatic pressing; superalloy powders,"Qu, ZH; Zhang, PX; Liang, SJ; Lai, YJ; Luo, C",2020.0,JournalEA,ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS,10.1002/adem.202000534,"[Qu, Zonghong; Zhang, Pingxiang] Northwestern Polytech Univ, State Key Lab Solidificat Proc, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Qu, Zonghong; Liang, Shujin; Lai, Yunjin; Luo, Cheng] Sino Euro Mat Technol Xian Co Ltd, Xian 710018, Peoples R China",WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,English,1438-1656,

The development of Hadoop is contemporary with the evolution of networks towards the new architectures Software Defined. To create our emulation environment, tailored to SDNs, we employ MaxiNet, given its capability of emulating large-scale SDNs. We make it possible to emulate realistic Hadoop scenarios on large-scale SDNs using low-cost commodity hardware, by resolving a few key limitations of MaxiNet through appropriate configuration settings. We validate the MaxHadoop emulator by executing two benchmarks, namely WordCount and TeraSort, to evaluate a set of Key Performance Indicators.

WoS,Soil erosion and flood hazard zonation using morphometric and morphotectonic parameters in Upper Alaknanda river basin,"In the present study, detailed morphometric, morphotectonic, statistical and hazard analyses have been carried out in the Upper Alaknanda river basin (UAB) located in Central Himalayas, Garhwal, India. The study area is bounded by the South Tibetan Detachment System in the north and by the Main Central Thrust in the south. The major river flowing in the area is Alaknanda which is a major tributary of river Ganga. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of active tectonics, flood hazard, and soil erosion on the basis of morphotectonic and morphometric parameters using the Cartosat-1 Digital Elevation Model and ArcGIS software. The study area is divided into 10 sub-basins, where 50 morphometric and 6 morphotectonic parameters were calculated. Bifurcation ratio and stream frequency show that streams up to third order is having steep gradient and rolling through highly dichotomized terrain, due to which high overland flow and less groundwater recharge takes places, whereas drainage density clearly indicates the high flood possibility in the region. Morphotectonic parameters indicate relatively young to an early mature geological stage of sub-basins and tectonically active region. The statistical analysis of morphometric parameters is carried out by using correlation analysis, hierarchal cluster analysis, and principal component analysis. Based on their susceptibility to soil erosion, morphometry and landcover classification is carried out to prioritize the sub-basins of UAB. The combined morphometric, morphotectonic and statistical analysis indicates that the area is tectonically active and highly prone to flood, flood induced landslide and soil erosion. The case study of the 2013 flash flood event at three locations Benakuli, JP HEP and Pulna also confirms that the study area is hydro-geologically active to flood and flood induced hazards.

WoS,Global and local diagnostic analytics for a geostatistical model based on a new approach to quantile regression,"Data with spatial dependence are often modeled by geoestatistical tools. In spatial regression, the mean response is described using explanatory variables with georeferenced data. This modeling frequently considers Gaussianity assuming the response follows a symmetric distribution. However, when this assumption is not satisfied, it is useful to suppose distributions with the same asymmetric behavior of the data. This is the case of the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution, which has been considered in different areas and particularly in environmental sciences due to its theoretical arguments. We propose a geostatistical model based on a new approach to quantile regression considering the BS distribution. Global and local diagnostic analytics are derived for this model. The estimation of model parameters and its local influence are conducted by the maximum likelihood method. Global influence is based on the Cook distance and it is compared to local influence, in both cases to detect influential observations, whose detection and removal can modify the conclusions of a study. We illustrate the proposed methodology applying it to environmental data, which shows this situation changing the conclusions after removing potentially influential observations.

WoS,A novel curation system to facilitate data integration across regional citizen science survey programs,"Integrative modeling methods can now enable macrosystem-level understandings of biodiversity patterns, such as range changes resulting from shifts in climate or land use, by aggregating species-level data across multiple monitoring sources. This requires ensuring that taxon interpretations match up across different sources. While encouraging checklist standardization is certainly an option, coercing programs to change species lists they have used consistently for decades is rarely successful. Here we demonstrate a novel approach for tracking equivalent names and concepts, applied to a network of 10 regional programs that use the same protocols (so-called Pollard walks) to monitor butterflies across America north of Mexico. Our system involves, for each monitoring program, associating the taxonomic authority (in this case one of three North American butterfly fauna treatments: Pelham, 2014; North American Butterfly Association, Inc., 2016; Opler & Warren, 2003) that shares the most similar overall taxonomic interpretation to the program's working species list. This allows us to define each term on each program's list in the context of the appropriate authority's species concept and curate the term alongside its authoritative concept. We then aligned the names representing equivalent taxonomic concepts among the three authorities. These stepping stones allow us to bridge a species concept from one program's species list to the name of the equivalent in any other program, through the intermediary scaffolding of aligned authoritative taxon concepts. Using a software tool we developed to access our curation system, a user can link equivalent species concepts between data collecting agencies with no specialized knowledge of taxonomic complexities.",Taxonomic names; Taxonomic concept; Data integration; Compatibility; Macrosystems analysis; Species monitoring programs; Species checklists; Citizen science; North American butterflies; PollardBase,"Campbell, DL; Thessen, AE; Ries, L",2020.0,Journal,PEERJ,10.7717/peerj.9219,"[Campbell, Dana L.] Univ Washington, Sch STEM, Div Biol Sci, Bothell, WA 98011 USA; [Thessen, Anne E.] Ronin Inst Independent Scholarship, Montclair, NJ USA; [Thessen, Anne E.] Oregon State Univ, Ctr Genome Res & Biocomp, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Ries, Leslie] Georgetown Univ, Dept Biol, Washington, DC 20057 USA",PEERJ INC,English,2167-8359,

Results A total of 19,881 workers were evaluated in 52 centers. Mean age was 41.1 years old, 43.9% men and 56.1% women. Mean duration of the test was around 2 min. Of the workers, 7.8% presented abnormalities in retinal fundus images, being the main findings choroidal nevus (2.4%), macular pigment abnormalities (1.5%), glaucomatous optic disc (1.2%), and macular signs of high myopia (1.1%). The presence of abnormalities was associated with greater age, being 5%, 7.9%, 12.6%, and 19.7% in workers less than 40 years, from 40 to 49, 50-59, and >= 60 years (p < 0.05), respectively. Men had more abnormalities in retinal fundus images than women (8.6 vs. 7.2;p < 0.05 RR: 1.2; CI 1092-1322).

WoS,Channel aware wireless body area network with cognitive radio technology in disaster cases,"Today, developments in wireless technologies and the increase in disaster cases reveal the necessity of various wireless technologies cooperation. Several technologies are able to cooperate with each other for eHealth, IoT, and so forth applications in disaster cases with the pros and cons of today's communications. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) and cognitive radio (CR) are promising technologies that can be used together to troubleshoot communication problems and make rescue operations successful in disaster situations. WBAN is a radio frequency-based wireless network technology that aims to monitor the functions and conditions of the human body through the sensor nodes that form a network. CR proposes solutions to current problems of wireless communications such as spectrum scarcity and inefficient use of the spectrum. In this study, CR-based WBAN architecture is proposed in disaster cases, and so the emergency, time-critical, and vital signs of WBAN users (endangered people and rescue team members) are able to reach the health unit or disaster management unit in an opportunistic way. CR technology is integrated with a WBAN architecture utilizing the CSMA/C-based IEEE 802.15.6 standard, and performance analysis is executed with the Riverbed Modeler simulation software. Furthermore, using the channel bonding technique, the throughput, the delay, the packet delivery ratios, and energy consumption ratios of the proposed architecture are investigated. According to the results, it was found that CR-based WBAN architecture was 25% more successful in energy efficiency and 5% more successful in packet delivery ratio with channel bonding technique than the traditional WBAN.",channel bonding; cognitive radio network; disaster case; IEEE 802; 15; 6; wireless body area network,"Cicioglu, M; Calhan, A",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS,10.1002/dac.4565,"[Cicioglu, Murtaza] Minist Natl Educ, Informat Technol Dept, Bolu, Turkey; [Calhan, Ali] Duzce Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Duzce, Turkey",WILEY,English,1074-5351,
WoS,DISCERN: Enhanced Dynamic noISe varianCe based EneRgy sensing for cognitive radio using USRP at Wi-Fi bands,"Spectrum sensing is one of the critical tasks in a cognitive radio system that allows a secondary user to use the spectrum while the primary user does not use it. The energy detection (ED) sensing is one of the most common techniques to identify the unused portions in the spectrum bands. In ED, threshold plays a vital role in signal detection, and noise is one of the significant factors in threshold calculation. However, ED efficiency is degraded by the noise uncertainty phenomenon caused by the random changes in noise level. The adverse effects of noise uncertainty are reduced by changing its detection threshold dynamically to the noise circumstances encountered during each sensing period. In the proposed method, received random samples are arranged inMblocks, applied strong Pearson correlation to separate and estimate the variance from the noise samples. The enhanced dynamic noise variance-based energy sensing is implemented in GNU radio processing blocks and tested on industrial, scientific, medical (ISM) 2.4 GHz frequency bands by using national instrument universal software radio peripheral (NI USRP-2932) device. The experimental results of proposed energy detction mechanism are compared with existing sensing techniques.",dynamic threshold; energy detection; GNU radio; noise uncertainty; USRP,"Reddy, AA; Battula, RB; Gopalani, D; Chaithanya, K",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS,10.1002/dac.4550,"[Reddy, Avuthu Avinash; Battula, Ramesh Babu; Gopalani, Dinesh] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India; [Chaithanya, Kurra] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India",WILEY,English,1074-5351,
WoS,Retinal Vascular Tortuosity and Diameter Associations with Adiposity and Components of Body Composition,"Objective The aim of this study was to assess whether adiposity or body composition relates to microvascular characteristics of the retina, indicative of cardiometabolic function. Methods A fully automated QUARTZ software processed retinal images from 68,550 UK Biobank participants (aged 40-69 years). Differences in retinal vessel diameter and tortuosity with body composition measures from the Tanita analyzer were obtained by using multilevel regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, clinic, smoking, and Townsend deprivation index. Results Venular tortuosity and diameter increased by approximately 2% (P < 10(-300)) and 0.6 mu m (P < 10(-6)), respectively, per SD increase in BMI, waist circumference index, waist-hip ratio, total body fat mass index, and fat-free mass index (FFMI). Venular associations with adiposity persisted after adjustment for FFMI, whereas associations with FFMI were weakened by FMI adjustment. Arteriolar diameter (not tortuosity) narrowing with FFMI was independent of adiposity (-0.6 mu m; -0.7 to -0.4 mu m per SD increment of FFMI), while adiposity associations with arteriolar diameter were largely nonsignificant after adjustment for FFMI. Conclusions This demonstrates, on an unprecedented scale, that venular tortuosity and diameter are more strongly associated with adiposity, whereas arteriolar diameter relates more strongly to fat-free mass. Different attributes of the retinal microvasculature may reflect distinct roles of body composition and fatness on the cardiometabolic system.",,"Tapp, RJ; Owen, CG; Barman, SA; Welikala, RA; Foster, PJ; Whincup, PH; Strachan, DP; Rudnicka, AR",2020.0,JournalEA,OBESITY,10.1002/oby.22885,"[Tapp, Robyn J.; Owen, Christopher G.; Whincup, Peter H.; Strachan, David P.; Rudnicka, Alicja R.] St Georges Univ London, Populat Hlth Res Inst, London, England; [Tapp, Robyn J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Barman, Sarah A.; Welikala, Roshan A.] Kingston Univ, Fac Sci Engn & Comp, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England; [Foster, Paul J.] UCL Inst Ophthalmol, Integrat Epidemiol Res Grp, London, England; [Foster, Paul J.] Moorfields Eye Hosp, NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, London, England",WILEY,English,1930-7381,
WoS,Computed tomography angiography as an adjunct to computational fluid dynamics for prediction of oxygenator thrombus formation,"Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit performance can be compromised by oxygenator thrombosis. Stagnant blood flow in the oxygenator can increase the risk of thrombus formation. To minimize thrombogenic potential, computational fluid dynamics is frequently applied for identification of stagnant flow conditions. We investigate the use of computed tomography angiography to identify flow patterns associated with thrombus formation. Methods: A computed tomography angiography was performed on a Quadrox D oxygenator, and video densitometric parameters associated with flow stagnation were measured from the acquired videos. Computational fluid dynamics analysis of the same oxygenator was performed to establish computational fluid dynamics-based flow characteristics. Forty-one Quadrox D oxygenators were sectioned following completion of clinical use. Section images were analyzed with software to determine oxygenator clot burden. Linear regression was used to correlate clot burden to computed tomography angiography and computational fluid dynamics-based flow characteristics. Results: Clot burden from the explanted oxygenators demonstrated a well-defined pattern, with the largest clot burden at the corner opposite the blood inlet and outlet. The regression model predicted clot burden by region of interest as a function of time to first opacification on computed tomography angiography (R-2 = 0.55). The explanted oxygenator clot burden map agreed well with the computed tomography angiography predicted clot burden map. The computational fluid dynamics parameter of residence time, when summed in the Z-direction, was partially predictive of clot burden (R-2 = 0.35). Conclusion: In the studied oxygenator, clot burden follows a pattern consistent with clinical observations. Computed tomography angiography-based flow analysis provides a useful adjunct to computational fluid dynamics-based flow analysis in understanding oxygenator thrombus formation.",oxygenator thrombosis; oxygenator flow; oxygenator imaging; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation thrombus; oxygenator clot,"Conway, RG; Zhang, JF; Jeudy, J; Evans, C; Li, TL; Wu, ZJJ; Griffith, BP",2020.0,JournalEA,PERFUSION-UK,10.1177/0267659120944105,"[Conway, Robert G.; Zhang, Jiafeng; Evans, Charles; Li, Tieluo; Wu, Zhongjun Jon; Griffith, Bartley P.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Surg, 10 South Pine St,MSTF 436, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Jeudy, Jean] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Diagnost Radiol & Nucl Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Wu, Zhongjun Jon] Univ Maryland, Fischell Dept Bioengn, A James Clark Sch Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,English,0267-6591,

Here we introduce a customizable and flexible workflow, designed with the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 in mind, as a means of reinforcing fundamental biology concepts using bioinformatics approaches. This workflow is accessible to a wide range of students in life science majors regardless of their prior bioinformatics knowledge, and all software is freely available, thus eliminating potential cost barriers. Using the workflow can thus provide a diverse group of students the opportunity to conduct inquiry-driven research. Here we demonstrate the utility of this workflow and outline the logical steps involved in the identification of therapeutic or vaccine targets against SARS CoV-2. We also provide an example of how the workflow may be adapted to other infectious microbes.

WoS,Application of chemometrics to prediction of some wheat quality factors by near-infrared spectroscopy,"Background and objectives Physical quality parameters of wheat include kernel texture and test weight, which affect classification, grading, and price. Physicochemical factors are associated with flour functionality. The objective of the work was to determine the effectiveness with which these factors could be predicted in early generations using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Wheat breeders need to know how their new genetic lines carry these factors, which carry no identifiable absorbers in the NIR region, can be predicted in early generations, by experts in the use of NIRS and its associated chemometrics. Findings With the exception of protein content, for which absorbers are plentiful, and was included to verify the spectral quality of the sample sets, none of the strictly physical factors could be reliably predicted with the most widely used chemometric options in the hands of experts in their use. Random forest algorithms were capable of prediction of all physicochemical factors, except Farinograph development time, with a reasonable degree of reliability. Conclusions Reliable predictions of quality factors in wheat that can be predicted by NIRS with satisfactory reliability are limited to chemical and physicochemical factors for which absorbers exist in the NIR region. Significance and novelty Chemical, physicochemical, and physical factors can be predicted with acceptable reliability by NIRS using a computerized spectrophotometer in association with Random Forest software.

WoS,Proportional adaptive algorithm to improve reception techniques and mitigate the multipath fading effect in sub-6GHz 5Gapplications,"This letter presents a proportional adaptive technique to mitigate the multipath fading effect in advanced wireless communication systems. The designed system consists of a realized ultra-wideband (UWB) dual antenna array and two universal software radio peripheral (USRP) platforms synchronized by a MIMO cable, with one digital RF phase shifter implemented in the reception chain of one of the two receiving antennas. Without requiring any statistical knowledge channel, the proposed approach adjusts the phase shifter in order to maximize the combined received power proportionally to the amplitude of its gradient. The used antennas operate in different frequencies in the fifth-generation (Sub-6 GHz 5G) wireless communication applications. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on a USRP that has been used to carry out experimental measurements on fixed and mobile receiving antennas, and it is compared with other approaches. The measurements reveal, that using the amplitude of the gradient of the received power rather than its sign, as it is proposed in the initial on-off algorithm presented in a previous published work, allows achieving better performance in combatting fading. The phase adjustment with the proposed algorithm is more efficient than in the other approaches allowing a better reception of the received signal with a higher received power level. The measured performances indicate that gain improvement of 8 to 10 dB can be achieved by using the proportional adaptive technique.",adaptive antenna; antenna array; fading channels; interference; LabVIEW; multipath; USRP,"Mosbah, A; Mansoul, A; Benssalah, M; Ghanem, F",2020.0,JournalEA,MICROWAVE AND OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY LETTERS,10.1002/mop.32547,"[Mosbah, Abdelkader; Benssalah, Mustapha] Ecole Mil Polytech, Lab Traitement Signal, Algiers, Algeria; [Mansoul, Ali] Ctr Dev Technol Avancees, Telecom Div, Cite 20 Aout 1956, Algiers, Algeria; [Ghanem, Farid] Cevital Ind Pole, Brandt Grp, R&D&I, Telecom Prod Direct, Garidi 2, Algiers, Algeria",WILEY,English,0895-2477,

We focus on three main challenges: 1) how to specify autonomous system behavior in the face of unpredictability; 2) how to carry out faithful analysis of system behavior with respect to rich environments that include hu-mans, physical artifacts, and other systems; and 3) how to build such systems by combining executable modeling techniques from software engineering with artificial intelligence and machine learning.",autonomous systems; autonomics; trustworthy systems,"Harel, D; Marron, A; Sifakis, J",2020.0,Journal,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.2003162117,"[Harel, David; Marron, Assaf] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel; [Sifakis, Joseph] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Verimag Lab, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,English,0027-8424,
WoS,The safety and efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided ablation therapy for solid pancreatic tumors: a systematic review,"Background and aims Recently, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided ablation therapy, as a minimally invasive technique, has shown its potential to substitute surgery in treating solid pancreatic tumors, such as small potential malignant pancreatic tumors, small insulinomas and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (LAPDAC). Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to assess the safety and efficacy of EUS-guided ablation therapy for solid pancreatic tumors. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of Science databases from inception to February 2020. The endpoints were clinical success and complications rates. The pooled event rate was calculated using Comprehensive Meta Analysis software. Results Fourteen studies with a total of 158 patients were included in our final analysis. The major types of solid pancreatic tumors were nonfunction pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (n = 78, 49.4%), LAPDAC (n = 48, 30.4%) and insulinomas (n = 26, 16.5%). Overall, the pooled clinical success rate was 85.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 75.4-92.4%,I-2 = 25.18%), pooled complications rate was 29.1% (95% CI: 18.6-42.3%,I-2 = 50.40%). Subgroup analysis was performed based on ablation methods, which showed clinical success rate for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was 83.5% (95% CI: 67.9-92.4%), and 87.9% (95% CI: 66.2-96.4%) for ethanol ablation (EA). In terms of complications rate, it was 32.2% (95% CI: 19.4-48.4%) for RFA, and 21.2% (95% CI: 6.8-49.9%) for EA.

Method: The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters of the previously isolated thirty eight compounds were predicted using SwissADME web tool whereas OSIRIS Property Explorer was used for toxicity risk assessment and drug- likeliness. Twelve compounds were selected for docking on human alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylaseenzymes using Autodock 4.0 software. Furthermore, the active extract wasin vivotested for the antidiabetic activity and then identified usingTLC bioautographic method. Results and Discussion: Eriodictyol was found to have the highest potential as an inhibitor against alpha-amylase with binding energy of -9.92 kcal/mol. Rutin was the most potent against alpha-glucosidase with binding energy of-9.15 kcal/mol. A considerable number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were computed between the compounds and the enzymes thereby making them energetically favorable and suggesting inhibition of these two enzymes as a plausible molecular mechanism for their antidiabetic effect.

WoS,Analysis of microstructural parameters and quantification of phases in a plasma-nitrided AISI 4140 steel,"It is well known that plasma nitriding improves the mechanical, tribological, and corrosion-resistance properties of low-alloy steels. Nitride formation on the surface of the material could be the cause of these changes. However, there is no information specifically regarding the analysis and quantification of microstructural parameters produced after a nitriding plasma treatment on AISI 4140 steel. This work aims to determine the microstructural parameters (crystallite size and microstrain) and to quantify the nitride phases formed on the surface of the alloy by the nitriding treatment in order to find a possible correlation with the values of microhardness. The microstructural parameters and phase quantification were calculated from a Rietveld analysis using Materials Analysis Using Diffraction (MAUD) software. The results indicate that characteristics, such as phase, composition and thickness, can be easily changed by varying the working parameters.

WoS,Earwig fan designing: Biomimetic and evolutionary biology applications,"Technologies to fold structures into compact shapes are required in multiple engineering applications. Earwigs (Dermaptera) fold their fanlike hind wings in a unique, highly sophisticated manner, granting them the most compact wing storage among all insects. The structural and material composition, in-flight reinforcement mechanisms, and bistable property of earwig wings have been previously studied. However, the geometrical rules required to reproduce their complex crease patterns have remained uncertain. Here we show the method to design an earwig-inspired fan by considering the flat foldability in the origami model, as informed by X-ray microcomputed tomography imaging. As our dedicated designing software shows, the earwig fan can be customized into artificial deployable structures of different sizes and configura-tions for use in architecture, aerospace, mechanical engineering, and daily use items. Moreover, the proposed method is able to reconstruct the wing-folding mechanism of an ancient earwig rel-ative, the 280-million-year-old Protelytron permianum. This allows us to propose evolutionary patterns that explain how extant ear-wigs acquired their wing-folding mechanism and to project hypo-thetical, extinct transitional forms. Our findings can be used as the basic design guidelines in biomimetic research for harnessing the excellent engineering properties of earwig wings, and demon-strate how a geometrical designing method can reveal morpho-functional evolutionary constraints and predict plausible biological disparity in deep time.",biomimetics; deployable structure; aerospace engineering; dermaptera; origami,"Saito, K; Perez-de la Fuente, R; Arimoto, KI; Seong, YA; Aonuma, H; Niiyama, R; You, Z",2020.0,Journal,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,10.1073/pnas.2005769117,"[Saito, Kazuya] Kyushu Univ, Fac Design, Fukuoka 8158540, Japan; [Fuente, Ricardo Perez-de la] Univ Oxford, Museum Nat Hist, Oxford OX1 3PW, England; [Arimoto, Koichi] Phylogeny & Evolut Lab, JT Biohist Res Hall, Takatsuki, Osaka 5691125, Japan; [Seong, Young ah; Niiyama, Ryuma] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Aonuma, Hitoshi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Inst Elect Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600812, Japan; [You, Zhong] Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford OX1 3PJ, England; [Arimoto, Koichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Kyoto 6068502, Japan",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,English,0027-8424,
WoS,"Meta-analysis of the Effect of Ginger (Zingiber officinale) on Health Status, Production Indices and Semen Quality in Chickens","Nutritional strategies that improve growth performance indices in chickens without increasing feed consumption are desirable considering the escalating feed cost. The use of spices to maintain health and increase productivity in livestock and poultry has been documented. However, a consensus has not been attained whether ginger, one of such spices, improves productivity in poultry. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to ascertain the effect of ginger administration on chicken performance. We searched AGORA, Scopus, Science Direct and Google Scholar for papers published in English using Boolean operators, proximity searching, wildcard and alternate spelling. Selected criteria were randomized and control trials with chickens, studies published in peer-reviewed journals, reported at least one presentation form of ginger and outcomes of interest and a measure of dispersion (standard deviation orpvalue). Twenty-one papers that satisfy the selection criteria were employed to determine the impact of ginger on feed intake, body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), organ weight, semen parameters and total serum lipid (triglyceride and cholesterol) content using Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution software. A positive relationship was found between ginger and semen quality in chickens. Ginger administration improved BWG (Hedges'd,d = 0.495; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.041-0.949;p = 0.033) and FCR (d = - 0.732; 95% CI - 1.195 to - 0.270;p = 0.002) taking cognizance of publication bias and heterogeneity. Restricted subgroup analysis showed there is a positive association between ginger powder and FCR (d = - 0.732; 95% CI = 1.195 to - 0.270;p = 0.002). Meta-regression revealed that covariates (duration of administration, dietary form, inclusion level and strain) explained most of the heterogeneity. The occurrence of variations and publication bias does not pose a major problem in this study since a relatively large number of unpublished studies will be needed to change significant impacts.

Reaction mixtures are prepared in array format using a fluid handling robot and spotted on a flat polytetrafluoroethylene plate at densities up to 6144 per plate. The reaction and analysis steps are performed simultaneously using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) to release microdroplets containing the reaction mixture from the plate for reaction prior to arrival at a mass spectrometer. Analysis rates are up to 1 reaction mixture per second and data are recorded in real time using an ion trap mass spectrometer. Beacon compounds are used to triangulate position on the plate and this allows tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to be performed on confirm products of interest. Custom software allows the user to control the system. It is also used to receive data from the DESI mass spectrometer to screen the spectra for compounds of interest, to perform MS/MS and to save data. This custom software also communicates with the software controlling the fluid handling robot (Biomek i7) as well as the Beckman software used to prepare reaction mixtures and also the software that controls the solvent used as the DESI spray.

WoS,AnisoDipFit: Simulation and Fitting of Pulsed EPR Dipolar Spectroscopy Data for Anisotropic Spin Centers,"Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance dipolar spectroscopy (PDS) allows to measure the distances between electron spin centers and, in favorable cases, their relative orientation. This data is frequently used in structural biology for studying biomolecular structures, following their conformational changes and localizing paramagnetic centers within them. In order to extract the inter-spin distances and the relative orientation of spin centers from the primary, time-domain PDS signals, a specialized data analysis is required. So far, the software to do such analysis was available only for isotropicS = 1/2 spin centers, such as nitroxide and trityl radicals, as well as for high-spin Gd(3+)and Mn(2+)ions. Here, a new data analysis program, called AnisoDipFit, was introduced for spin systems consisting of one isotropic and one anisotropicS = 1/2 spin centers. The program was successfully tested on the PDS data corresponding to the spin systems Cu2+/organic radical, low-spin Fe3+/organic radical, and high-spin Fe3+/organic radical. For all tested spin systems, AnisoDipFit allowed determining the inter-spin distance distribution with a sub-angstrom precision. In addition, the spatial orientation of the inter-spin vector with respect to theg-frame of the metal center was determined for the last two spin systems. Thus, this study expands the arsenal of the PDS data analysis programs and facilitates the PDS-based distance and angle measurements on the highly relevant class of metolloproteins.",,"Abdullin, D",2020.0,JournalEA,APPLIED MAGNETIC RESONANCE,10.1007/s00723-020-01214-0,"[Abdullin, Dinar] Univ Bonn, Inst Phys & Theoret Chem, Bonn, Germany",SPRINGER WIEN,English,0937-9347,
WoS,"Joint penalized spline modeling of multivariate longitudinal data, with application to HIV-1 RNA load levels and CD4 cell counts","Motivated by the need to jointly model the longitudinal trajectories of HIV viral load levels and CD4 counts during the primary infection stage, we propose a joint penalized spline modeling approach that can be used to model the repeated measurements from multiple biomarkers of various types (eg, continuous, binary) simultaneously. This approach allows for flexible trajectories for each marker, accounts for potentially time-varying correlation between markers, and is robust to misspecification of knots. Despite its advantages, the application of multivariate penalized spline models, especially when biomarkers may be of different data types, has been limited in part due to its seemingly complexity in implementation. To overcome this, we describe a procedure that transforms the multivariate setting to the univariate one, and then makes use of the generalized linear mixed effect model representation of a penalized spline model to facilitate its implementation with standard statistical software. We performed simulation studies to evaluate the validity and efficiency through joint modeling of correlated biomarkers measured longitudinally compared to the univariate modeling approach. We applied this modeling approach to longitudinal HIV-1 RNA load and CD4 count data from Southern African cohorts to estimate features of the joint distributions such as the correlation and the proportion of subjects with high viral load levels and high CD4 cell counts over time.",bivariate; joint modeling; longitudinal; penalized spline; random effects,"Zhao, LH; Chen, T; Novitsky, V; Wang, R",2020.0,JournalEA,BIOMETRICS,10.1111/biom.13339,"[Zhao, Lihui] Northwestern Univ, Dept Prevent Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Chen, Tom; Wang, Rui] Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care Inst, Dept Populat Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Chen, Tom; Wang, Rui] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Novitsky, Vladimir] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Immunol & Infect Dis, Boston, MA USA; [Wang, Rui] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA USA",WILEY,English,0006-341X,
WoS,Brain functional connectivity during storage based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging with synchronous urodynamic testing in healthy volunteers,"The aim of the study was to elucidate the correlation between spatially distinct brain areas with a full bladder from the perspective of functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with simultaneous urodynamic testing in healthy volunteers. The brain regions with full and empty bladders were reported via rs-fMRI using a 3 T magnetic resonance system. Then, we identified brain regions that are activated during bladder filling by calculating the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) values using brain imaging software (DPABI and SPM8) and empirically derived six regions of interest (ROI) from analysis of activation were used as seeds for resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analysis with the rest of the brain to examine differences in the two conditions. Statistical analysis was performed with a paired t-test and statistical significance was defined as aP < 0.01. Twenty-two healthy volunteers (11 men and 11 women) 35-64 years of age were enrolled. The rs-fMRI scans of 22 healthy volunteers were analyzed. After motion correction, two subjects were excluded. Meaningful data were obtained on 20 of these subjects. Compared with an empty bladder, functional connection enhancement was noted mainly in the right inferior orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral calcarine gyrus, the left lingual gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, right insula, right inferior temporal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, left insula, right lingual gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, superior parietal lobe, left calcarine gyrus, bilateral lingual gyrus, prefrontal cortex, including the middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, and right precuneus. The decrease in functional connection was mainly located in the right inferior orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, including the superior frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex, the left inferior orbitofrontal cortex, right insula, middle occipital gyrus, angular gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, right insula, middle temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, middle occipital gyrus, supplementary motor area, superior frontal gyrus, left insula, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral precuneus, middle occipital gyrus, and right middle temporal lobe. There were significant changes in the functional connectivity of the brain between full and empty bladders in healthy volunteers, which suggests that the central neural processes involved in storage needs brain areas with integrated control.

WoS,Forensic age estimation in living adolescents with CT imaging of the clavicula-impact of low-dose scanning on readers' confidence,"Objectives Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the clavicula displays the reference standard for forensic bone age diagnostics in adolescents and young adults. Consequently, highest efforts on radiation reduction are warranted. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of low-dose (LD) CT imaging of the clavicula for age estimation in living adolescents. Methods A total of 207 non-contrast chest CT of 144 patients born between 1988 and 2012, performed in 2018 due to various clinical indications, were included in this retrospective study. The mean patient age was 16.9 +/- 6.6 years. Patients were divided into a LD (n = 146) and standard-dose (SD;n = 61) group. Image quality, confidence levels, and ossification stages (using the 5-stage classification including the subgroups 2a-3c) were assessed by two radiologists independently. Radiation dose was determined via dosimetry software. Results Dose simulation withz-axis reduction to depict the clavicula only resulted in a median exposure of 0.1 mSv (IQR: 0.0) in LD compared with 0.9 mSv (IQR: 0.6) in SD (p < 0.001). The median image quality was rated by both readers significantly worse in LD compared with SD on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 with a median of 3 (IQR: 1) versus 4 (IQR: 0;p < 0.001 for both readers). There was an almost perfect agreement for the ossification stages between both readers with a Cohen's kappa of 0.83 (p < 0.001). Median confidence levels of both readers were not significantly different between LD and SD in the decisive subgroups 2a-3c.

WoS,Phylogenetic relationships between different raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) populations based on four nuclear and Y genes,"Background The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), endemic to East Asia, is classified as six subspecies according to their geographical distribution including a population introduced to Europe. Studies on phylogenetic relationship or population genetics in both native and introduced areas have been carried out recently. Lately, opinions that Japanese raccoon dogs should be classified as a different species were asserted based on several studies using karyotypes, morphometric characters, mtDNA, and microsatellites analysis. However, no data pertaining to the nuclear DNA (nDNA) or Y chromosome are available. Objective To estimate the relationship among the species using different genes is necessary in understanding of the history of this species. Method Therefore, we investigated nDNA and Y chromosomes in our study to define relationships: (1) between continental raccoon dog populations, (2) between original and introduced groups, and (3) between continental and Japanese groups. Results The analysis of four nuclear (CHRNA1,VTN,TRSP,WT1) andZFYgenes indicated that there had been no genetic differentiation among the continental populations. However, significant differences were observed between continental and Japanese raccoon dogs inVTNandZFYgenes implying genetic differentiation has been going between them.

WoS,"Why translational medicine is, in fact, new, why this matters, and the limits of a predominantly epistemic historiography","Is Translational Science and Medicine new? Its dramatic expansion has spelled a dizzying array of new disciplines, departments, buildings, and terminology. Yet, without novel theories or concepts, Translational Science and Medicine (TSM) may appear to be nothing more than an old concept with a new brand. Yet, is this view true? As is illustrated herein, histories of TSM which treat it as merely an old product under a new name misunderstand its essential architecture. As an expressly economic transformation, modern translational approaches are differentiated precisely by a set of semi-permanent architectures which render it an altogether different kind of object when compared to previous attempts by institutions to turn science into medicine. Powered by new software, embedded within campuses that now house companies, and with legal agreements that outline agreed-upon scientific activity, TSM is now powered by a set of robust and durable structures that differentiate it from previous approaches. Based on ethnographic research about translational neuroscience in North America, this paper suggests that the sense of TSM as not being new is a consequence of analytic modes that tend to see scientific enterprises in epistemic terms alone. Analyzing TSM as primarily a scientific object misses the fact that it is a principally a financial one.",Translational medicine; Translational science; Translational research; Commercialization; Finance; Political economy,"Robinson, M",2020.0,Journal,HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE LIFE SCIENCES,10.1007/s40656-020-00324-z,"[Robinson, Mark] Creighton Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies, Grad Program Bioeth, 2500 Calif Plaza, Omaha, NE 68178 USA",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,English,0391-9714,
WoS,A workflow for standardising and integrating alien species distribution data,"Biodiversity data are being collected at unprecedented rates. Such data often have significant value for purposes beyond the initial reason for which they were collected, particularly when they are combined and collated with other data sources. In the field of invasion ecology, however, integrating data represents a major challenge due to the notorious lack of standardisation of terminologies and categorisations, and the application of deviating concepts of biological invasions. Here, we introduce the SInAS workflow, short for Standardising and Integrating Alien Species data. The SInAS workflow standardises terminologies following Darwin Core, location names using a proposed translation table, taxon names based on the GBIF backbone taxonomy, and dates of first records based on a set of predefined rules. The output of the SInAS workflow provides various entry points that can be used both to improve coherence among the databases and to check and correct the original data. The workflow is flexible and can be easily adapted and extended to the needs of different users. We illustrate the workflow using a case-study integrating five widely used global databases of information on biological invasions. The comparison of the standardised databases revealed a surprisingly low degree of overlap, which indicates that the amount of data may currently not be fully exploited in the original databases. We highly recommend the use and development of publicly available workflows to ensure that the integration of databases is reproducible and transparent. Workflows, such as SInAS, ultimately increase trust in data, study results, and conclusions.",databases; Darwin Core; GBIF; invasive alien species; R software environment; reproducibility; standardisation; taxonomy; workflow,"Seebens, H; Clarke, DA; Groom, Q; Wilson, JRU; Garcia-Berthou, E; Kuhn, I; Roige, M; Pagad, S; Essl, F; Vicente, J; Winter, M; McGeoch, M",2020.0,Journal,NEOBIOTA,10.3897/neobiota.59.53578,"[Seebens, Hanno] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Clarke, David A.; McGeoch, Melodie] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Groom, Quentin] Meise Bot Garden, Meise, Belgium; [Wilson, John R.

WoS,Characterization of AZ91 magnesium alloy processed by cyclic contraction/expansion extrusion using the experimental and micromechanical cellular automaton finite element approach,"The feasibility to fabricate ultra-fine-grained AZ91 Mg alloy is investigated with a newly presented severe plastic deformation method entitled cyclic contraction/expansion extrusion. In this method, an initial cylindrical AZ91 Mg billet is placed into a die and the moving punch causes the large deformations by extruding the material in two different regions entitled contraction and extrusion. The evolution of AZ91 microstructure and mechanical properties during cyclic contraction/expansion extrusion was studied through different experimental observations. The microstructure observations showed the ultra-fine-grained structure of AZ91 at the end of the third pass where the average grain size of 600 nm obtained from the initial value of 130 mu m. The tensile tests showed that the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, hardness, and elongation of AZ91 cyclic contraction/expansion extrusion-processed samples are increased significantly. Discontinuous dynamic recrystallization has a main role in the grain refinement of Mg alloys during hot deformations. The evolution of grains in microlevel is analyzed by the cellular automaton finite element method in the DEFORM software environment. The macroscopic flow parameters including effective plastic strain, stain rate, and temperature were calculated in finite element. By tracing these data in defined domain of cellular automaton, the discontinuous dynamic recrystallization of material is analyzed through a devised cellular automaton finite element post-processing step. The imposed plastic strain and variation of dislocation density are the two main driven forces in discontinuous dynamic recrystallization of AZ91 samples during cyclic contraction/expansion extrusion processing. The experimentally observed grains and the cellular automaton finite element predicted microstructure were reasonably in good agreement.",Cyclic contraction; expansion extrusion; fine-grained structure; cellular automaton; discontinuous dynamic recrystallization,"Sadr, MH; Jafarzadeh, H",2020.0,JournalEA,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS,10.1177/1464420720944194,"[Hatami Sadr, M.; Jafarzadeh, H.] Islamic Azad Univ, Tabriz Branch, Dept Mech Engn, Tabriz, Iran",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,English,1464-4207,
WoS,Multimodal mimicry of hosts in a radiation of parasitic finches,"Brood parasites use the parental care of others to raise their young and sometimes employ mimicry to dupe their hosts. The brood-parasitic finches of the genusViduaare a textbook example of the role of imprinting in sympatric speciation. Sympatric speciation is thought to occur inViduabecause their mating traits and host preferences are strongly influenced by their early host environment. However, this alone may not be sufficient to isolate parasite lineages, and divergent ecological adaptations may also be required to prevent hybridization collapsing incipient species. Using pattern recognition software and classification models, we provide quantitative evidence thatViduaexhibit specialist mimicry of their grassfinch hosts, matching the patterns, colors and sounds of their respective host's nestlings. We also provide qualitative evidence of mimicry in postural components ofViduabegging. Quantitative comparisons reveal small discrepancies between parasite and host phenotypes, with parasites sometimes exaggerating their host's traits.

WoS,Gain-loss framing and patients' decisions: a linguistic examination of information framing in physician-patient conversations,"When discussing risks and benefits with cancer patients, physicians could focus on losses such as mortality rates and cancer recurrence or, alternatively, gains such as survival rates and curing cancer. Previous research has shown that the way health information is framed influences individuals' preferences and choices. We operationalized gain-loss framing as physicians' choice of words related to gains (cancer survival), or losses (cancer mortality). In an exploratory analysis, we investigated (a) whether physicians used gain or loss words as a function of their recommendation, (b) whether physicians' choice of words was associated with patients' treatment choices. We analyzed transcribed consultations with male patients who had intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Using an iterative process of gathering and evaluating words, we created gain- and loss-dictionaries. The loss-dictionary included words related to cancer death and cancer progression. The gain-dictionary included words related to survival and cure. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software, we calculated the number of words related to gains and losses in each transcript. We found that physicians who recommended immediate cancer treatment for prostate cancer (vs. active surveillance) used slightly fewer words related to losses and significantly fewer words related specifically to death from cancer. Further analysis showed that loss words were associated with the patient's choice of immediate cancer treatment. A novel method of automated text analysis showed that physicians' use of loss words was correlated with physicians' recommendations for cancer treatment versus active surveillance. Additionally, loss words in consultations were associated with patients' choice of cancer treatment.",LIWC; Decision making; Cancer; Gains; Losses; Framing; Prostate cancer; Active surveillance; Prospect theory; Health communication,"Fridman, I; Fagerlin, A; Scherr, KA; Scherer, LD; Huffstetler, H; Ubel, PA",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,10.1007/s10865-020-00171-0,"[Fridman, Ilona; Huffstetler, Hanna; Ubel, Peter A.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Fridman, Ilona] Duke Univ, Duke Margolis Ctr Hlth Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Fagerlin, Angela] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Fagerlin, Angela] Salt Lake City VA Informat Decis Enhancement & An, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Scherr, Karen A.] Duke Sch Med, Family Med & Community Hlth, Durham, NC USA; [Scherer, Laura D.] Univ Colorado, Div Cardiol, Adult & Child Consortium Hlth Outcomes Res & Deli, Sch Med, Aurora, CO USA; [Scherer, Laura D.] VA Denver, Ctr Innovat Vet Ctr & Value Driven Care, Denver, CO USA; [Ubel, Peter A.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC USA; [Ubel, Peter A.] Duke Sch Med, Durham, NC USA",SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,English,0160-7715,
WoS,Seismic and structural health monitoring of Cabril dam. Software development for informed management,"Nowadays, the management and safety control of large dams is generally based on automatic monitoring, including the so-called seismic and structural health monitoring systems (SSHM), using the latest technology for automatic data measurement, acquisition and transmission. These systems should include software for automatic management and analysis of continuous monitoring data and software for numerical simulation of the dam dynamic behavior using 3D finite element models. This software should be designed to provide useful and reliable information to meet the needs and expectations of stakeholders, and to support the studies of researchers and engineers responsible for structural health monitoring. This paper is focused on the experience gathered from the SSHM system of Cabril dam, a 132 m high-arch dam, in Portugal, that has been under continuous dynamic monitoring since 2008. The importance of the software specifically developed for automatic modal identification, automatic detection of seismic vibrations (distinct from vibrations due to the operation of discharge gates and power groups), and automatic comparison between experimental data and computed results from a reference finite element model of the dam-reservoir-foundation system, is highlighted. This software includes: (1) the generation of graphics with the evolution of the identified natural frequencies over time and the comparison with calculated frequencies using different hypothesis for concrete damage evolution; and (2) a service to automatically send emails summarizing key dynamic monitoring results to stakeholders to provide the necessary support for informed management and engineering decision making.

WoS,Hymenophore configuration of the oak mazegill (Daedalea quercina),"The complex hymenophore configuration of the oak mazegill (Daedalea quercina, Polyporales) is rarely quantified, although quantifications are important analytical tools to assess form and growth. We quantified the hymenophore configuration of the oak mazegill by manual counting of tubes and tubular branches and ends. Complementary measurements were made with the software AngioTool. We found that the number of tubular branches and ends varied substantially between specimens, with a positive correlation with hymenophore area (5-51 cm(2)). We then measured complexity as tubular branches and ends per area, and complexity was not correlated with the size of the basidiocarps. Basidiocarps from two locations were compared (Hald ege, N = 11; Hvidding krat, N = 7), and the prevalence of branches and that of ends were greater in the Hvidding krat hymenophores (P< 0.001 andP= 0.029, respectively). Additionally, lacunarity, a measure of complexity (gappiness), gave a higher score for the Hald ege hymenophores (P= 0.002). Lacunarity analysis of multiple species of Polyporales showed that the oak mazegill hymenophore is comparatively complex. Concerning factors that affect hymenophore complexity of the oak mazegill, we observed that greater hymenophore complexity was associated with abrupt boundaries between growth zones on the pileus surface. Several years of monitoring documented that basidiocarps can remodel to gravitational changes and heal from damage. In conclusion, intra- and interspecies differences of hymenophore configuration can be quantified. In oak mazegill, hymenophore complexity is not dependent on size per se, although abrupt borders between growth zones are associated with increased complexity. Some of the variation between basidiocarps may reflect aspects of the ecology of the individual fungus.",Complexity; growth; hymenophore; lacunarity; morphometrics,"Jensen, B; Coolen, BF; Smit, TH",2020.0,JournalEA,MYCOLOGIA,10.1080/00275514.2020.1785197,"[Jensen, Bjarke; Smit, Theodoor H.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam Cardiovasc Sci, Dept Med Biol, Meibergdreef 15, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Coolen, Bram F.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam Cardiovasc Sci, Dept Biomed Engn & Phys, Meibergdreef 15, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands",TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,English,0027-5514,

Because of their high computational demand, analyses of source-projected hdEEG data are typically performed offline. Here, we present a real-time noninvasive electrophysiology toolbox, RT-NET, which has been specifically developed for online reconstruction of neural activity using hdEEG. RT-NET relies on the Lab Streaming Layer for acquiring raw data from a large number of EEG amplifiers and for streaming the processed data to external applications. RT-NET estimates a spatial filter for artifact removal and source activity reconstruction using a calibration dataset. This spatial filter is then applied to the hdEEG data as they are acquired, thereby ensuring low latencies and computation times.

WoS,"Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius Linnaeus,1758) population structure revealed by microsatellite DNA: genetic diversity masked by population mixing in shared areas","Background. The Mediterranean swordfish stock is overfished and considered not correctly managed. Elucidating the patterns of the Mediterranean swordfish population structure constitutes an essential prerequisite for effective management of this fishery resource. To date, few studies have investigated intra-Mediterranean swordfish population structure, and their conclusions are controversial. Methods. A panel of 20 microsatellites DNA was used to investigate fine-scale population structuring of swordfish from six main fishing areas of the Mediterranean Sea. Results. This study provides evidence to reject the hypothesis of a single swordfish population within the Mediterranean Sea. DAPC analysis revealed the presence of three genetic clusters and a high level of admixture within the Mediterranean Sea. Genetic structure was supported by significant F-ST values while mixing was endorsed by the heterozygosity deficit observed in sampling localities indicative of a possible Wahlund effect, by sampling admixture individuals. Overall, our tests reject the hypothesis of a single swordfish population within the Mediterranean Sea. Homing towards the Mediterranean breeding areas may have generated a weak degree of genetic differentiation between populations even at the intra-basin scale.",DAPC; Swordfish; Mediterranean Sea; Microsatellites; Population genetics; Population structure,"Righi, T; Splendiani, A; Fioravanti, T; Petetta, A; Candelma, M; Gioacchini, G; Gillespie, K; Hanke, A; Carnevali, O; Barucchi, VC",2020.0,Journal,PEERJ,10.7717/peerj.9518,"[Righi, Tommaso; Splendiani, Andrea; Fioravanti, Tatiana; Petetta, Andrea; Candelma, Michela; Gioacchini, Giorgia; Carnevali, Oliana; Barucchi, Vincenzo Caputo] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Vita & Ambiente, Ancona, Italy; [Gillespie, Kyle; Hanke, Alex] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, St Andrews Biol Stn, Ottawa, ON, Canada",PEERJ INC,English,2167-8359,
WoS,Dynamic analysis of health-related factors with its impacts on economic growth,"The largest capital of a country is its human resources. Given that Iran is one of the richest countries in terms of human resources, economic growth of the country depends upon the performance and efficiency of its human resources. Special attention should be paid to the health of the society, especially the workforce. Health is one of the factors that can play a major role in enhancing productivity by reducing staff absenteeism due to illness as well as increasing concentration of staff, improving performance and ultimately enhancing staff productivity. It can provide for better and better production and services in the country, followed by growth and prosperity. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the impacts of health-related factors on economic growth of the country. Because of the complexity of the problem, we have used system dynamics approach to model problem. The model was simulated using VENSIM computer software, and the results showed that by increasing the per capita exercise among the people of the country as well as improving the nutrition habit contribution to the long-term economic growth of the country while improving the country's health can occur.",Dynamics; Health; Economic growth; Human resources; Productivity,"Mehrjerdi, YZ; Alemzadeh, R; Hajimoradi, A",2020.0,Journal,SN APPLIED SCIENCES,10.1007/s42452-020-03203-1,"[Mehrjerdi, Yahia Zare; Hajimoradi, Amir] Yazd Univ, Fac Ind Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Yazd, Iran; [Alemzadeh, Ramin] Yazd Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Yazd, Iran",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,English,2523-3963,

Air holes look like rectangular shape in cladding area and elliptical air hole in the center zone are considered for the proposed PCF. To identify loss characteristics of the proposed PCF, effective material loss (EML) and confinement loss also have been studied in this paper. The commercial optical properties analyzer, COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a software has been used for numerical analysis of the designed PCF. To obtain the optimal PCF structure properties, we have varied the elliptical shaped air holes major axis length and adjacent ellipse pitch distance. Numerical analysis shows the maximum birefringence of 0.0921 and minimum confinement loss of 1.36 x 10(-4) cm(-1) for the proposed PCF.

WoS,Using Sentinel-1 Imagery to Assess Predictive Performance of a Hydraulic Model,"This study seeks to test the predictive performance of a hydraulic model using as reference the flood extent extracted through Sentinel-1 imagery. A precipitation event which took place between the 22nd and 28th of February 2018 in Pineios river basin, Central Greece, was analyzed. A threshold technique was performed to delineate the inundation extent from the satellite image, whereas both HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS software were coupled to simulate the examined storm event. To assess model response, the flooded area derived through the modeling approach was compared against that derived from the satellite image processing, using an area-based measure of fit. Furthermore, an uncertainty analysis on the parameters of the hydrologic model was elaborated to investigate their impact on the results of the hydraulic model. The sensitivity of the latter to the value of the roughness coefficient as well as to changes in the spatial resolution of the utilized topography was also examined. Considering as a perfect response of the model its complete coincidence with the satellite image product, it was found that the hydraulic model performance ranged between 61.04%-65.49%, depending on the selected upstream flow hydrograph, topography and roughness coefficient. The upstream flow conditions proved to play a more critical role, while roughness coefficient and topography were found to cause slighter changes in model response.",Flood map; Sentinel-1 imagery; Remote sensing; HEC-HMS; HEC-RAS; Uncertainty,"Zotou, I; Bellos, V; Gkouma, A; Karathanassi, V; Tsihrintzis, VA",2020.0,JournalEA,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,10.1007/s11269-020-02592-7,"[Zotou, Ioanna; Bellos, Vasilis; Gkouma, Angeliki; Tsihrintzis, Vassilios A.] Natl Tech Univ f Athens, Ctr Assessment Nat Hazards & Proact Planning, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece; [Zotou, Ioanna; Bellos, Vasilis; Gkouma, Angeliki; Tsihrintzis, Vassilios A.] Natl Tech Univ f Athens, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Lab Reclamat Works & Water Resources Management, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece; [Karathanassi, Vassilia] Natl Tech Univ f Athens, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Remote Sensing Lab, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece",SPRINGER,English,0920-4741,
WoS,Intraoperative Gamma Probe for Locating Cancerous Lymph Nodes,"A novel concept of an intraoperative gamma probe was simulated using GATE opensource software for the purpose of detecting and identifying sentinel lymph nodes during sentinel lymph node mapping. The probe is made of a pixelated Bismuth Germanium Oxide scintillator, BGO, which will be coupled to a Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) to collect the scintillation light. The probe detector has 9 pixels, each pixel is 3 x 3 mm(2), for a total detection active area of 81 mm(2). The detector height is 5 mm long. The probe detector was able to identify small sentinel lymph nodes with a 4 mm diameter. Sentinel nodes were placed at 6 different heights away from the detector surface starting at 2 mm up to 12 mm with 2 mm increments at each height. The pixel with the node directly above, node center is at the same axis as the pixel center, had consistently registered greater number of counts compared to neighboring pixels. Moving the sentinel node over all detector pixels produced similar results, where the pixel with the source directly above produced greater counts. Each pixel on the detector surface has a 2 pi steradian solid angle, so collectively the detector has the same solid angel, but as wide as the detector whole area. Depending on the shielding used around the probe head, the solid angle can be minimized or maximized to investigate a specific area during the mapping process of lymph nodes.",Intraoperative probes; Gamma probes; Sentinel lymph nodes; GATE simulation; Sentinel node localization,"Abolaban, F; Alhawsawi, A",2020.0,JournalEA,ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,10.1007/s13369-020-04805-y,"[Abolaban, Fouad; Alhawsawi, Abdulsalam] King Abdulaziz Univ, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,2193-567X,
WoS,Minimize the delays in software defined network switch controller communication,"Summar Software Defined Networks (SDN) is now the leading framework for the existing network infrastructure. Increasing Internet traffic leads to attract SDN infrastructure in large networks like enterprise or data centers by using logical centralize control concept. This abstraction, flexibility, and agility enable the network managers to view the global picture of the network and flow the traffic in an efficient way to avoid congestion and traffic delay issues. However, besides the benefits, the internal mechanism of SDN has some serious challenges, which leads flow table overflow, congestions, controller and switch overloading, link failure and latency issues. This research focus on the delays produced during communication between control plane and data plane due to the parameters like rule formation, mismatches, buffer/queue constraints, flow entries, controller resource utilization or duplicate flow packets, and unordered packets. These delays become more critical in large networks especially in-case of reactive modes. Furthermore, the frequent rule composition and installation causes extra burden at the controller, this control communication needs prompt reply to forward the traffic in a stipulated time. This article presents the Efficient Resource Management Scheme (ERMS), which efficiently handle the inter-communication delay and minimize the network overheads. The experiment results depict the better performance of ERMS during the communication between controller and switch by efficient packet handling and flow rules management while minimizes the overheads on controller. The proposed solution enhances the performance of SDN networks by improving the quality of services parameters.",Mininet; Open vSwitch; OpenFlow; POX; QoS; SDN software-defined networking,"Iqbal, S; Qureshi, KN; Shoaib, F; Ahmad, A; Jeon, G",2020.0,JournalEA,CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE,10.1002/cpe.5940,"[Iqbal, Saleem] Arid Agr Univ, Univ Inst Informat Technol, Rawalpindi, Pakistan; [Shoaib, Faisal] Bahria Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Awais] Univ Milano Statale, Dipartimento Informat DI, Milan, Italy; [Qureshi, Kashif Naseer; Jeon, Gwanggil] Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Embedded Syst Engn, Incheon 22012, South Korea",WILEY,English,1532-0626,
WoS,Regional Nerve Block Complication Analysis Following Peripheral Nerve Block During Foot and Ankle Surgical Procedures,"Background Foot and ankle surgeries are frequently accompanied by a peripheral nerve block in order to reduce postoperative pain. Higher than expected complication rates with peripheral nerve blocks have led to increased concern among surgeons and patients. To our knowledge, no study conducted by the treating surgeon has identified risk factors that may predispose a patient to complications. Our goal was to attempt to identify those risk factors. Methods We reviewed patient charts of those who underwent an orthopedic foot and ankle procedure between 2013 and 2018, as performed by the senior author. This yielded 992 procedures performed across four surgical locations. Of these procedures, 137 procedures were removed because no block was used. The remaining cases were analyzed for nerve complications, defined as sensory or motor deficits along the distribution of a nerve. The patients were divided into those with and without complications and were evaluated for differences. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS (R) software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). Results The overall short-term complication rate was 10.1% and the long-term complication rate was 4.3%, with a total of 855 blocks given. Electromyographies (EMGs) were performed on 24.4% of the patients with a complication. Of the EMGs, 95.2% confirmed nerve complications in the distribution of the blocked nerve. The significant factors associated with complications were age, BMI, location, and smoking status. A regression analysis was performed to determine the odds ratio for individual factors. Those with significantly higher odds ratio were between 40 and 65 years of age, had normal or underweight BMI, underwent surgery at an outpatient surgery center, and were current smokers. Conclusions Our study suggests that there are significant epidemiological factors in predicting postoperative complications related to a peripheral nerve block. The study also shows a similar short-term complication rate but a higher long-term complication rate than other studies. This data are important because it allows for an informed decision to be made between a surgeon, anesthesiologist, and the patient regarding the safety and necessity of delivering a preoperative peripheral nerve block based on patient risk factors.",peripheral nerve block; outcome studies; statistical analysis; popliteal block; complications; demographics,"Lauf, JA; Huggins, P; Long, J; AL, M; Byrne, B; Large, BP; Whitehead, B; Cheney, NA; Law, TD",2020.0,Journal,CUREUS,10.7759/cureus.9434,"[Lauf, Jason A.; Huggins, Pearson; AL-Issa, Mohammed; Whitehead, Brent] Ohio Univ1, Heritage Coll Osteopath Med, Orthoped Surg, Dublin, OH 43016 USA; [Long, Joseph] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Byrne, Brian] Mercy St Elizabeth Boardman Hosp, Emergency Med, Youngstown, OH USA; [Large, Bryan P.] Ohio Hlth Doctors Hosp, Anesthesiol, Columbus, OH USA; [Cheney, Nicholas A.] OrthoNeuro, Foot & Ankle Surg, Columbus, OH USA; [Law, Timothy D., Sr.] Ohio Univ, Heritage Coll Osteopath Med, Family Med, Athens, OH 45701 USA",CUREUS INC,English,,
WoS,"Associations between muscle measures, survival, and toxicity in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer","Background Standard treatment for patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS SCLC) is concurrent platinum-etoposide chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT). Up to 30% of patients are cured, but severe toxicity is common, and we are not able to identify those who are cured or those who experience severe toxicity before chemoradiotherapy commences. Studies of other cancer patients show that low muscle mass and muscle radiodensity are associated with inferior survival and that a high drug dose per kilogram lean body mass (LBM) is associated with more toxicity, but this has not been investigated in LS SCLC. We analysed patients from a randomized trial comparing two schedules of TRT (n = 157) to investigate the prognostic and predictive role of these muscle measures in LS SCLC. Methods Patients from a trial comparing once daily hypofractionated with twice daily hyperfractionated TRT were analysed. The skeletal muscle index (SMI), skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD), and LBM were assessed from baseline computed tomography scans at the L3 level using the SliceOMatic software. Results Images at the L3 level were available for 122 patients (77.7%). Median age was 64 years, 18% had performance status 2, and 38% had stage III. Grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 89%, and 5% died from treatment-related side effects. Overall, the median overall survival was 23 months, and the 5 year survival was 25%. Median LBM was 45.2 (range: 16-65) kg, the median SMI 44.8 (range: 29-77) cm(2)/m(2), and the median SMD 39.3 (range 16-62) HU. There were no significant associations between survival and any of the muscle measures in the univariable analyses (SMI:P = 0.906, SMD:P = 0.829) or in multivariable analyses adjusting for baseline characteristics (SMI:P = 0.836, SMD:P = 0.260). A higher cisplatin dose per kilogram LBM in the first course significantly increased the risk of grade 3-4 haematological toxicity (P = 0.011) and neutropenic infections (P = 0.012). Conclusions Patients who received a high dose of cisplatin per kilogram LBM had more haematological toxicity and neutropenic infections than other patients. None of the muscle measures were independent prognostic factors for survival in our cohort of LS SCLC patients who underwent standard chemoradiotherapy.",Prognostic factor; Predictive factor; Survival; Skeletal muscle index; Skeletal muscle radiodensity,"Halvorsen, TO; Valan, CD; Slaaen, M; Gronberg, BH",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF CACHEXIA SARCOPENIA AND MUSCLE,10.1002/jcsm.12583,"[Halvorsen, Tarje Onsoien; Valan, Christine Damgaard; Gronberg, Bjorn Henning] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Clin & Mol Med, NTNU, POB 8905, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Halvorsen, Tarje Onsoien; Valan, Christine Damgaard; Gronberg, Bjorn Henning] Trondheim Reg & Univ Hosp, St Olavs Hosp, Dept Oncol, Trondheim, Norway; [Slaaen, Marit] Innlandet Hosp Trust, Dept Internal Med, Hamar, Norway; [Slaaen, Marit] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Inst Clin Med, Oslo, Norway",WILEY,English,2190-5991,

WoS,Vertical Bone Implant Contact Around Anterior Immediate Implants and Their Stability After Using Either Alloplast or L-PRF or Both in Peri-Implant Gap: A Prospective Randomized Trial,"Purpose Various graft materials have been studied for filling peri-implant gap (PIG), but there was no similar randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of Platelet-rich fibrin or alloplast or their combination on vertical bone implant contact (BIC) around immediate implants and their stability over a period of 1 year. Methods Immediate implants were placed in maxillary anterior region of 30 subjects (n = 10). Either alloplast (group I) or L-PRF (group II) or both (group III) were used to fill the PIG following randomization chart. Vertical BIC was measured on peri-apical radiographs which were taken immediately after placement, after 3, 6 and 12 months using Image J software. Periotest was used to measure the implant stability at the time of implant placement, at 3, 6 and 12 months after implantation. Results The comparison of distance from implant shoulder to the first visible bone-to-implant contact (IS-BIC) in each group showed statistically significant bone formation on mesial and distal sides over a 1 year period (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in IS-BIC distance among the three groups at 1 year (p > 0.05). Periotest values showed that there was significant improvement in implant stability in all groups in 1-year period. On intergroup comparison, the mean difference of periotest values was statistically non-significant among three groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions All the graft materials were effective in promoting osseointegration when used as PIG filling materials alone or in combination around immediate implants in maxillary anterior region.

WoS,Personality Correlates of Compassion: a Cross-Cultural Analysis,"Objectives Compassion for others is linked to positive outcomes ranging from stress reduction to prosocial behaviour. However, the personality traits that contribute to compassion have not been well established. We sought to explore the individual differences most strongly related to dispositional compassion in Canada and Spain using the HEXACO model of personality. Methods Canadian (N = 555; 75.8% women) and Spanish (N = 371; 60.8% women) adults aged 17 to 68 years completed the HEXACO-60 personality inventory, a trait emotional intelligence (EI) scale, and a measure of compassion for others using online survey software. The factor structure and cultural invariance of the compassion measure were assessed, and regression analyses were calculated to determine the strongest predictors of compassion. Results In both samples, emotionality was the strongest predictor of compassion, accounting for about 10% of the unique variance in scores. Trait EI, honesty-humility, and openness also predicted compassion, while agreeableness was significant only among Canadians, suggesting there is at least one cross-cultural difference in personality antecedents. Conclusions Emotionality and emotional intelligence were strongly linked to compassionate individuals in two distinct cultures, and honesty-humility and openness were weakly predictive as well. Agreeableness was only related among Canadians, suggesting that while the degree to which agreeableness predicts compassion is dependent on the cultural context, the personality antecedents of compassion are similar across cultures.",Compassion; Positive psychology; Personality; Cross-cultural psychology,"Sinclair, VM; Topa, G; Saklofske, D",2020.0,JournalEA,MINDFULNESS,10.1007/s12671-020-01459-7,"[Sinclair, Vanessa M.; Saklofske, Donald] Western Univ, London, ON, Canada; [Topa, Gabriela] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Natl Distance Educ Univ, Madrid, Spain",SPRINGER,English,1868-8527,

WoS,Improving the learning of thickening design through graphical methods with the freeware software SMath studio,"Thickening consists of separating parts of a suspension by sedimentation under the force of gravity, to obtain a denser product and a clarified liquid. Depending on which part is needed to recover, the denser product or the pure liquid, we use the term thickening or clarification to define these operations. Thickener design is compulsory for chemical engineering (CE) curricula and is usually introduced in courses related to unit operations. Thickening design problems are solved by geometric methods (e.g., Coe-Clevenger or Kynch-Roberts methods). However, nowadays, computers play a more and more important role in CE practice. Both specific and general software solutions are essential. Whereas CE-specific software is adequate for graduates and professionals, general mathematical software can also be used in class. They can help to deliver certain competences included in the vast majority of CE curricula. For CE introductory courses, software with integrated functions and friendly interfaces are generally preferred over those that require to be familiarized with programming languages. Here, we describe the use of SMath Studio in 2nd-year engineering courses by nonfamiliarized students. SMath Studio is a comprehensive mathematical notebook, similar to Mathcad, but it is entirely free for personal or commercial use. In this study, student's opinion was surveyed.

This study investigated the biomechanical mechanism of stent-graft-induced new lesions after implantation and analyzed the relationship between radial force and spring-back force of the stent-graft when it was implanted virtually under different oversizing ratios. Based on the computed tomography angiography images, a three-dimensional geometric model of a patient-specific aortic dissection was established. The stent was designed in CAD software and the stent-graft implantation procedure under different oversizing ratios was simulated in the finite element analysis software. Implantation simulations were performed six times for each stent-graft model under 0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, and 15% oversizing ratios and the peak stress of the aorta was compared among groups. It was observed that the peak stress of the aorta was located where the proximal bare stent interacted with aortic wall and its value was increased by 62.2% from 0% to 15% oversizing ratio. The conclusions are reached that the long-term higher stress in the aortic wall may lead to the emergence of new lesions in these areas, and the radial force plays a key role in the formation of a new entry in the real aorta model.",aortic dissection; finite element analysis; peak stress; stent-graft induced new entry,"Meng, ZY; Ma, T; Cai, YH; Liu, XD; Wang, SZ; Dong, ZH; Fu, WG",2020.0,JournalEA,ARTIFICIAL ORGANS,10.1111/aor.13750,"[Meng, Zhuangyuan; Cai, Yunhan; Liu, Xudong; Wang, Shengzhang] Fudan Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Room 2512 East Guanghua Main Bldg,220 Handan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Ma, Tao; Dong, Zhihui; Fu, Weiguo] Fudan Univ, Zhongshan Hosp, Dept Vasc Surg, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China",WILEY,English,0160-564X,
WoS,Association between host wing morphology polymorphism andWolbachiainfection inVollenhovia emeryi(Hymenoptera: Myrmicinae),"Many eusocial insects, including ants, show complex colony structures, distributions, and reproductive strategies. In the antVollenhovia emeryiWheeler (Hymenoptera: Myrmicinae), queens and males are produced clonally, while sterile workers arise sexually, unlike other ant species and Hymenopteran insects in general. Furthermore, there is a wing length polymorphism in the queen caste. Despite its evolutionary remarkable traits, little is known about the population structure of this ant species, which may provide insight into its unique reproductive mode and polymorphic traits. We performed in-depth analyses of ant populations from Korea, Japan, and North America using three mitochondrial genes (COI, COII, and Cytb). The long-winged (L) morph is predominant in Korean populations, and the short-winged (S) morph is very rare. Interestingly, all L morphs were infected withWolbachia, while all Korean S morphs lackedWolbachia, demonstrating a association between a symbiont and a phenotypic trait. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the S morph is derived from the L morph. We propose that the S morph is associated with potential resistance toWolbachiainfection and thatWolbachiainfection does not influence clonal reproduction (as is the case in other ant species).",divergence; population structure; Vollenhovia emeryi; wing polymorphism; Wolbachiainfection,"Noh, P; Oh, SY; Park, S; Kwon, T; Kim, Y; Choe, JC; Jeong, G",2020.0,JournalEA,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1002/ece3.6582,"[Noh, Pureum; Choe, Jae Chun; Jeong, Gilsang] Ewha Womans Univ, Div EcoSci, Seoul, South Korea; [Noh, Pureum; Park, Soyeon; Choe, Jae Chun; Jeong, Gilsang] Natl Inst Ecol, Seoul 33657, South Korea; [Oh, Seung-Yoon] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Soyeon] Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch, Interdisciplinary Program EcoCreat, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwon, Taesung] Korea Forest Res Inst, Div Forest Ecol, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Yonghwan] Konkuk Univ, Dept Phys, Seoul, South Korea",WILEY,English,2045-7758,

Then, a fabricated prototype RA is tested to validate the design approach. The maximum measured gain is 25.3 dB at 10.4 GHz, whereas the gain is 24.6 dB with 44.2% aperture efficiency at the design frequency of 10 GHz. Also, the measured gain frequency characteristic shows the 1 and 3-dB gain bandwidths of 24.8% and 42.3%, respectively, and the measured radiation patterns verify the simulated ones as well.",bandwidth; gain; logarithmic unit-cell; phase-delay line; reflectarray antenna,"Heidari, AA; Ghafoorzadeh-Yazdi, A; Bakhoda, M",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RF AND MICROWAVE COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING,10.1002/mmce.22377,"[Heidari, Abbas Ali; Ghafoorzadeh-Yazdi, Ali; Bakhoda, Mohsen] Yazd Univ, Elect Engn Dept, Yazd, Iran",WILEY,English,1096-4290,
WoS,Technical Note: Dosimetric feasibility of lattice radiotherapy for breast cancer using GammaPod,"Purpose Studies on Lattice radiotherapy (LRT) for breast cancer have been largely lacking. This study investigates the dosimetric feasibility of using Gamma Pod, a stereotactic radiotherapy apparatus originally designed for breast SBRT, to deliver LRT to large, bulky breast tumor as a noninvasive treatment option. Methods The GammaPod-based LRT was simulated using Geant4 Gate Monte Carlo software. The simulated GammaPod was equipped with 5 mm diameter non-coplanar circular beams that span 28 degrees latitudinally from 18 degrees to 43 degrees off the horizontal plane. Two degrees longitudinal intervals were used to simulate rotating sources. To simulate the treatments to different breast sizes, three water-equivalent hemisphere volumes with diameters of 10, 15, and 20 cm were analyzed. The lattice was planned by spacing focal points 2 cm apart in the transverse and sagittal planes and 2.5 cm in the coronal plane. This resulted in 22-172 shots for full breast treatment. The maximum dose for each individual shot was 20 Gy. The peak-to-valley dose differences and skin dose were analyzed. To verify the feasibility of delivering LRT, a test plan was created and delivered to a commercial diode array dose verification device using a clinical GammaPod system with 15 mm collimators. Results The dose profiles showed the average peak-to-valley dose percent differences of 94.10% in the 10 cm hemispherical volume, 88.95% in the 15 cm hemispherical volume, and 83.60% in the 20 cm hemispherical volume. Average skin dose was 1.27, 1.72, and 2.13 Gy for the 10, 15, and 20 cm irradiation volumes, respectively. The LRT plan delivered using a clinical GammaPod system with larger collimators verified the feasibility of LRT plan delivery. Conclusion GammaPod-based lattice radiotherapy is a viable treatment option and its application can be extended to treating large bulky breast tumors.",GammaPod; lattice radiotherapy; stereotactic radiotherapy,"Kopchick, B; Xu, HJ; Niu, Y; Becker, S; Qiu, XY; Yu, C",2020.0,JournalEA,MEDICAL PHYSICS,10.1002/mp.14379,"[Kopchick, Benjamin; Qiu, Xiangyun] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Xu, Huijun; Becker, Stewart; Yu, Cedric] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Niu, Ying; Yu, Cedric] Xcision Med Syst, Columbia, MD 21045 USA",WILEY,English,0094-2405,
WoS,Theoretical analysis on the VSC instability caused by PLL in weak system,"The mechanism of voltage sourced converter's (VSC) instability caused by phase-locked-loop (PLL) in weak system is revealed in a simplified and efficient way. Based on the key-variables small signals model, the PLL's impact to VSC stability is described by the defined low frequency torque and high frequency torque. The low frequency torque decides the characteristic of VSC in low frequency domain, and supplies synchronous ability and low frequency damping to VSC, while the high frequency torque decides VSC's high frequency characteristic and supply high frequency damping. The two torques impact factors are researched and their influences are revealed. It is found that to keep system stable, sufficient torques are needed. Because weakening system strength will decrease both torques, the mechanism of the instability caused by PLL in weak system is actually lack of sufficient torques. The simulation based on PSCAD software is implemented to validate the theory and matches well with the proposed theory.",damping; power system stability; phase locked loops; power system control; synchronisation; torque control; voltage-source convertors; high frequency torque; synchronous ability; high frequency damping; VSC instability; voltage sourced converter; phase locked loop; low frequency torque; power system; power synchronization controlled VSC,"Li, BH; Chen, S; Liu, TQ",2020.0,Journal,IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION,10.1049/iet-rpg.2019.1349,"[Li, Baohong; Chen, Shi; Liu, Tianqi] Sichuan Univ, Coll Elect Engn, 24 South Sect 1,Yihuan Rd, Chengdu, Peoples R China",INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET,English,1752-1416,

Then, the probability model describing the interaction between the cracks and capsules was established using the probability theory of integral geometry. The theoretical solutions for the required capsule dosage for the two- and three-dimensional cases were derived. Finally, the calculated results for the theoretical model were compared with those provided by the computer simulation software. The results indicated that the model is suitable for analyzing and optimizing the capsule dosage required to repair cracks in concrete materials.

WoS,Pipeline design with flow assurance constraints in offshore production lines,"Multiphase flow in petroleum pipelines became more challenging due to the emergence of deeper wells at extreme environmental conditions. Flow assurance strategies ensure the production of hydrocarbons uninterruptedly. In this work we propose a simple and straightforward framework for design strategies for flow assurance constraints, implementing the most widely used models and correlations available. One-dimensional steady-state conservation equations were used for the modeling through a system of differential-algebraic equations, extending the previous work of Teixeira et al. (Rev IFP Energies Nouvelles 70(3):497-510, 2015) to incorporate flow assurance principles. Design strategies used for flowline internal diameter and insulation layer sizing were aggregated to the process modeling. The proposed modeling approach provided results with great agreement with the standard software used in oil industry (OLGA(R)) at industrial full-scale flow conditions, therefore providing a simple, robust and accurate tool for flow assurance calculations. Also comparing to OLGA(R), the proposed framework presented a much shorter simulation time when more refined pipeline discretization is required.

WoS,A new protocol for assessing the conservation priority of groundwater-dependent ecosystems,"Species of conservation concern are usually considered important elements in site prioritization for biodiversity conservation. To overcome the lack of information on species conservation status, multidimensional measures of species rarity can be used as proxies of species vulnerability. Under this assumption, a two-step protocol for site prioritization of aquatic groundwater-dependent ecosystems is proposed using invertebrate vulnerability estimated from species' traits. In the first step, each species occurring in the sites of interest are scored according to their vulnerability. In the second step, sites are prioritized using species' scores. Species vulnerability scores are based on five dimensions, for which various traits are scored: (i) geography, (ii) ecology, (iii) biology, (iv) population, and (v) evolutionary history. For each species, the scores of the various traits belonging to the same dimension are multiplied to obtain a synthetic score. These scores are then ranked into four classes and, for each dimension, each species receives a new score that reflects its rank. The sum of these scores represents the species' overall score. Site conservation priorities are assessed by combining species scores into three indices: Sum of Species Scores, Biodiversity Conservation Concern (which relates the sum of species scores with the local species richness) and Groundwater Biodiversity Concern (which is the average of the former two). The protocol is illustrated using case studies in Italy and it is fully implemented in the software AQUALIFE which is freely available at: by registered users. Sensitivity analyses showed that the protocol is robust against the lack of information on species biology or sampling limitations. However, trait scoring rests with the user, who must be familiar with the study group. This approach can be applied at any spatial scale and to different types of aquatic groundwater-dependent ecosystems.",aquatic groundwater-dependent ecosystems; conservation; crustaceans; invertebrates; stygobiont,"Fattorini, S; Fiasca, B; Di Lorenzo, T; Di Cicco, M; Galassi, DMP",2020.0,JournalEA,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,10.1002/aqc.3411,"[Fattorini, Simone; Fiasca, Barbara; Di Cicco, Mattia; Galassi, Diana M.

WoS,Global optimization via inverse distance weighting and radial basis functions,"Global optimization problems whose objective function is expensive to evaluate can be solved effectively by recursively fitting asurrogate functionto function samples and minimizing anacquisition functionto generate new samples. The acquisition step trades off between seeking for a new optimization vector where the surrogate is minimum (exploitationof the surrogate) and looking for regions of the feasible space that have not yet been visited and that may potentially contain better values of the objective function (explorationof the feasible space). This paper proposes a new global optimization algorithm that uses inverse distance weighting (IDW) and radial basis functions (RBF) to construct the acquisition function. Rather arbitrary constraints that are simple to evaluate can be easily taken into account. Compared to Bayesian optimization, the proposed algorithm, that we call GLIS (GLobal minimum using Inverse distance weighting and Surrogate radial basis functions), is competitive and computationally lighter, as we show in a set of benchmark global optimization and hyperparameter tuning problems.

WoS,"A qualitative assessment of barriers and facilitators to implementing recommended infant nutrition practices in Mumbai, India","Background Childhood malnutrition has been a longstanding crisis in Mumbai, India. Despite national IYCF (Infant Young Child Feeding) guidelines to promote best practices for infant/toddler feeding, nearly one-third of children under age five are stunted or underweight. To improve child nutrition, interventions should address the cultural, social, and environmental influences on infant feeding practices. This study is an in-depth qualitative assessment of family barriers and facilitators to implementing recommended nutrition practices in two Mumbai slum communities, within the context of an existing nutrition education-based intervention by a local non-governmental non-profit organization. Methods The population was purposively sampled to represent a variety of household demographics. Data were collected through 33 in-depth semi-structured interviews with caregivers (mothers and paternal grandmothers) of children age 0-2 years. Transcripts were translated and transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative analysis procedures and software. Results A complex set of barriers and facilitators influence mothers'/caregivers' infant-toddler feeding practices. Most infants were fed complementary foods and non-nutritious processed snacks, counter to IYCF recommendations. Key barriers included: lack of nutrition knowledge and experience, receiving conflicting messages from different sources, limited social support, and poor self-efficacy for maternal decision-making. Key facilitators included: professional nutrition guidance, personal self-efficacy and empowerment, and family support. Interventions to improve child nutrition should address mothers'/caregivers' key barriers and facilitators to recommended infant-toddler feeding practices. Conclusions Nutrition interventions should prioritize standard messaging across healthcare providers, engage all family members, target prevention of early introduction of sugary and non-nutritious processed foods, and strengthen maternal self-efficacy for following IYCF recommended guidelines.",Malnutrition; Maternal behavior; Feeding methods; India; Infant nutritional physiological phenomena practices; Barriers; Complementary feeding,"Athavale, P; Hoeft, K; Dalal, RM; Bondre, AP; Mukherjee, P; Sokal-Gutierrez, K",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION,10.1186/s41043-020-00215-w,"[Athavale, Priyanka] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hoeft, Kristin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Prevent & Restorat Dent Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Hoeft, Kristin] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Address Childrens Oral Hlth, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Dalal, Rupal M.; Mukherjee, Piyasree] Fdn Mother & Child Hlth, 93-C Kamgar Nagar,SG Barve Marg, Mumbai 400024, Maharashtra, India; [Bondre, Ameya P.] New Horizons Hlth & Res Fdn NHF, Unit 10,Techniplex 2,S V Rd,Opposite Hotel Grand, Mumbai 400062, Maharashtra, India; [Sokal-Gutierrez, Karen] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Sch Publ Hlth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",BMC,English,1606-0997,
WoS,Investigation of experimental results andD-optimal design of hafnium ion extraction from aqueous system using emulsion liquid membrane technique,"Hafnium metal is used in a wide range of industries such as microprocessor manufacturing, nuclear reactors and special alloys due to its physical, chemical and radiation properties. Emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) is an effective and efficient alternative for heavy metal separation compared to conventional methods due to high selectivity, energy-saving, high mass transfer and low operating capital. In this study, Cyanex 572 as a carrier, Span 85 as a surfactant, hydrochloric acid as an internal phase and kerosene as a diluent were used. In the first part of the study, the stability of the emulsions was investigated. The most stable emulsions were obtained by adding PIB polymer (3% w/v), Span 85 surfactant (3% w/v) and stirring for 15 min. In the second part, the separation of hafnium metal ions from aqueous solutions was investigated using ELM technique. The highest separation was obtained at 4% (v/v) as carrier concentration, 4% (w/v) as surfactant concentration, the membrane-to-feed volume ratio of 20/100 and W/O/W emulsion stirring rate and time equal to 400 rpm and 5 min, respectively. Moreover, to optimize the factors influencing the tests, the design of experiment (DOE) was performed usingD-optimal method via Design Expert 10 software. Based on DOE results, the maximum extraction (> 99%) was achieved when the carrier concentration, the surfactant concentration, W/O/W emulsion stirring time, W/O/W emulsion stirring rate and emulsion volume/feed phase ratio were 4.49% v/v, 3.90% w/v, 11.49 min, 310.54 rpm and 2:1, respectively.",Hafnium ion; D-optimal design; Emulsion liquid membrane; Design of experiment,"Salahshoori, I; Hatami, A; Seyfaee, A",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY,10.1007/s13738-020-02007-9,"[Salahshoori, Iman; Hatami, Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Seyfaee, Ahmad] Univ Adelaide, Sch Mech Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia",SPRINGER,English,1735-207X,
WoS,European maize genomes highlight intraspecies variation in repeat and gene content,"De novo genome assemblies of four European flint maize lines and comparison with two US Corn Belt genomes provide insights into the dynamics of intraspecies variation in repeat and gene content in maize genomes. The diversity of maize (Zea mays) is the backbone of modern heterotic patterns and hybrid breeding. Historically, US farmers exploited this variability to establish today's highly productive Corn Belt inbred lines from blends of dent and flint germplasm pools. Here, we report de novo genome sequences of four European flint lines assembled to pseudomolecules with scaffold N50 ranging from 6.1 to 10.4 Mb. Comparative analyses with two US Corn Belt lines explains the pronounced differences between both germplasms. While overall syntenic order and consolidated gene annotations reveal only moderate pangenomic differences, whole-genome alignments delineating the core and dispensable genome, and the analysis of heterochromatic knobs and orthologous long terminal repeat retrotransposons unveil the dynamics of the maize genome.

WoS,Genetic Diversity and Population Structure Analyses of Wild Relatives and Cultivated Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata(L.) Walp.) from Senegal Using Simple Sequence Repeat Markers,"Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata(L.)) is an important crop for food security in Senegal; therefore, understanding the genetic diversity of local germplasm is relevant for crop improvement and genetic maintenance in the era of climate change. For this purpose, 15 microsatellite markers were used to estimate the genetic diversity of Senegalese cowpea germplasm, including 671 accessions grown in eight regions and 66 wild relatives and intermediate forms (weedy). For the cultivated, the main expected heterozygosity (mHe) ranged between 0.317 (Fatick) and 0.439 (South). A narrow genetic variation between accessions from the different regions was observed with genetic similarity ranging from 0.861 to 0.965 and genetic differentiation indices (Fst) between 0.018 and 0.100. The accessions from southern Senegal (Kedougou, Sedhiou, and Kolda regions) are more diverse than the others. However, the accessions from the North (Saint-Louis) are genetically different from other regions. The diversity analysis in wild relatives from Senegal, which had never been performed before, revealed that the wild/weedy forms remain more diverse than the cultivated with genetic diversity values (He) of 0.389 and 0.480, respectively. STRUCTURE software divided the Senegalese germplasm into five subpopulations. Three of them (i, ii, and iii) included only cultivated accessions from several regions, one (v) mainly from Saint-Louis, and one (iv) the wild/weedy with some cultivated accessions.

WoS,Increasing the quality of services and resource utilization in vehicular cloud computing using best host selection methods,"One of the technology for increasing the safety and welfare of humans in roads is Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC). This technology can utilize cloud computing advantages in the Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET). VCC by utilizing modern equipment along with current vehicles, can play a significant role in the area of smart transportation systems. Given the potential of this technology, effective methods for managing existing resources and providing the expected service quality that is essential for such an environment are not yet available as it should. One of the most important barriers to providing such solutions seems to be resource constraints and very high dynamics in vehicles in VCC. In this article, based on virtualization and taking into account the environment with these features, we propose simple ways to manage resources better and improve the quality of service. We were able to achieve better results in simulation than previous methods by providing a flexible data structure to control the important data in the environment effectively. To illustrate the impact of the proposed methods, we compared them with some of the most important methods in this context, and we used SUMO 1.2.0 and MATLAB R2019a software to simulate them.

WoS,"Evaluation of Maximum Principal Stress, Von Mises Stress, and Deformation on Surrounding Mandibular Bone During Insertion of an Implant: A Three-Dimensional Finite Element Study","Aim The present study evaluated maximum principal stress, von Mises stress, and deformation on the mandible and surrounding structures during the insertion of an implant in various anatomical positions. Materials and Methods Finite clement models of straight two-piece implants of 4.5 mm x 11.5 mm were modeled using Ansys software, v. 16.0 (Ansys, Inc., Houston, TX, USA). The mandibular model was derived through cone-beam computed tomography of a cadaveric mandible using Mimics software (Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium). An osteotomy was performed at the first molar region, second premolar region, lateral incisor region, central incisor region, canine region, and second molar region that had varying bone densities. Implant insertion was simulated with a variable load of 1 - 180 Newton, which was applied axially downward with a rotational velocity of 30 - 120 rpm. Maximum principal stresses, von Mises stress distribution at the implant insertion site, and maximum deformation on the entire mandible were recorded during the insertion of the implants. Results Maximum principal stress was highest in the crestal area of the right first molar region and least in the middle third of the central incisor region during implant insertion. Von Mises stress in the mandible was highest in the right first molar region and the least in the lateral incisor region during implant insertion. The extent deformation was recorded on the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis of the mandible. Deformation on the x-axis was highest at the crestal region of the canine and least for the lateral incisor. On the y-axis, deformation was highest at the symphysis region during implant insertion at the first molar region and the least at the condylar area during implant placement in the canine area. On the z-axis, the deformation was highest at the condylar region during implant insertion at the first molar region, and the least was observed in the symphysis region during implant placement in the second molar region. Conclusion When overall stress was considered, there is a direct correlation between stress and quality of bone. The highest maximum principal stress and von Mises stress were recorded during the placement of implants in posterior regions of the mandible, which suggests that the presence of dense cortical bone results in higher stress values. The maximum deformation was observed at different regions of the mandible, away from the site of implant insertion. The resultant stress and deformation exerted on the bone during placement of implants at different sites in the mandible varies, which could be detrimental factors in the longevity of the implant.",maximum principal stress; finite element; von mises; flexible deformity; implant success,"Yemineni, BC; Mahendra, J; Nasina, J; Mahendra, L; Shivasubramanian, L; Perika, SB",2020.0,Journal,CUREUS,10.7759/cureus.9430,"[Yemineni, Bhavan Chand] Alluri Sitarama Raju Acad Med Sci Coll & Hosp, Dent & Oral Surg, Eluru, India; [Mahendra, Jaideep] Meenakshi Ammal Dent Coll & Hosp, Periodont, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Nasina, Jigeesh] Inst Chartered Financial Analysts India ICFAI Fdn, ICFAI Business Sch IBS Hyderabad, Operat & Informat Technol, Hyderabad, India; [Mahendra, Little] Maktoum Bin Hamdan Dent Univ Coll, Periodont, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Shivasubramanian, Lakshmi] Meenakshi Ammal Dent Coll & Hosp, Prosthodont, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Perika, Shareen Babu] Care Dent Coll, Periodont, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India",CUREUS INC,English,,

WoS,Evolutionary legacy of a forest plantation tree species (Pinus armandii): Implications for widespread afforestation,"Many natural systems are subject to profound and persistent anthropogenic influence. Human-induced gene movement through afforestation and the selective transportation of genotypes might enhance the potential for intraspecific hybridization, which could lead to outbreeding depression. However, the evolutionary legacy of afforestation on the spatial genetic structure of forest tree species has barely been investigated. To do this properly, the effects of anthropogenic and natural processes must be examined simultaneously. A multidisciplinary approach, integrating phylogeography, population genetics, species distribution modeling, and niche divergence would permit evaluation of potential anthropogenic impacts, such as mass planting near-native material. Here, these approaches were applied toPinus armandii, a Chinese endemic coniferous tree species, that has been mass planted across its native range. Population genetic analyses showed that natural populations ofP. armandiicomprised three lineages that diverged around the late Miocene, during a period of massive uplifts of the Hengduan Mountains, and intensification of Asian Summer Monsoon. Only limited gene flow was detected between lineages, indicating that each largely maintained is genetic integrity. Moreover, most or all planted populations were found to have been sourced within the same region, minimizing disruption of large-scale spatial genetic structure withinP. armandii. This might be because each of the three lineages had a distinct climatic niche, according to ecological niche modeling and niche divergence tests. The current study provides empirical genetic and ecological evidence for the site-species matching principle in forestry and will be useful to manage restoration efforts by identifying suitable areas and climates for introducing and planting new forests. Our results also highlight the urgent need to evaluate the genetic impacts of large-scale afforestation in other native tree species.",afforestation; forest plantations; niche divergence; Pinus armandii; spatial genetic structure,"Jia, Y; Milne, RI; Zhu, J; Gao, LM; Zhu, GF; Zhao, GF; Liu, J; Li, ZH",2020.0,JournalEA,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,10.1111/eva.13064,"[Jia, Yun; Zhu, Juan; Zhao, Gui-Fang; Li, Zhong-Hu] Northwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Resource Biol & Biotechnol Western China, Xian, Peoples R China; [Jia, Yun; Gao, Lian-Ming; Zhu, Guang-Fu; Liu, Jie; Li, Zhong-Hu] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, CAS Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Milne, Richard, I] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Mol Plant Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Zhu, Guang-Fu; Liu, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Germplasm Bank Wild Species, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China",WILEY,English,1752-4571,
WoS,Testing of support tools for plagiarism detection,"There is a general belief that software must be able to easily do things that humans find difficult. Since finding sources for plagiarism in a text is not an easy task, there is a wide-spread expectation that it must be simple for software to determine if a text is plagiarized or not. Software cannot determine plagiarism, but it can work as a support tool for identifying some text similarity that may constitute plagiarism. But how well do the various systems work? This paper reports on a collaborative test of 15 web-based text-matching systems that can be used when plagiarism is suspected. It was conducted by researchers from seven countries using test material in eight different languages, evaluating the effectiveness of the systems on single-source and multi-source documents. A usability examination was also performed.

WoS,A multi objective binary bat approach for testcase selection in object oriented testing,"Time and resources are usually neglected areas in the life cycle of software development. So, these become the primary constraints in software testing. Optimization of a test suite is quite crucial in reducing the complexity of the testing phase and selection of the test cases by eliminating redundant data; this is critical for defining the strategies. Most of the work in literature employs single-objective optimization methods. Though these are not always efficient, these play a critical role in the selection of a test case. Test case selection is, however, non-deterministic. Selection of test cases using Parallel Programming is treated as a complex task due to the need for higher performance in Parallel Computing. Parallel Computing can be stated as a combination of Computational mechanisms and Mathematical techniques. Hence, this investigation proposes a novel BAT algorithm for multi-objective optimization. It has code coverage as well as Object-oriented testing strategies. Comparing the experimental results with the Genetic Algorithm (GA), it is observed that the proposed method has faster convergence with adequate code coverage.",Test case selection; Software testing; Genetic algorithm (GA); And multi-objective BAT algorithm,"Geetha, B; Mala, DJ",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,10.1007/s12652-020-02360-w,"[Geetha, B.] Anna Univ, Chennai 600025, Tamil Nadu, India; [Mala, D.

WoS,Prediction of atherosclerosis pathology in retinal fundal images with machine learning approaches,"Atherosclerosis is a common cause of cardiac attack and its early detection prevents further complications. In this paper, a research concept is proposed focusing on a novel method of classification system. This method is carried out with image features derived from fundus photographs. It depends upon the arteries and vein classification process and also by the morphological appearance. Further, the proposed mixed algorithm, by using the retina fundal images, this method achieves an accuracy of detecting Atherosclerosis. In spite of the method being somewhat a hard one, of late, several methods are developed which employ advanced retinal photographic imaging techniques. These techniques involve characterizing, measuring and quantifying any variations and dissimilarities in the retinal structure. The hallmark of these methods, which have both qualitative and quantitative prediction, illustrated the allied symptoms found on cardiovascular diseases. This paper deals with providing the accurate input for the atherosclerosis detection by way of image preprocessing method. The study focuses on the reducing the disease independent variations without damaging any information related to the differences between the images of healthy and atherosclerotic eyes. The propose method enables correction of illumination in the blood vessels, by repainting them. Further, there is a normalization of the focus region for the feature extraction and classification process. Finally, Enhanced Bayesian Arithmetic Classifier (EBAC) is implemented for effective classification of the blood vessels.

WoS,Evidence for population genetic structure in two exploited Mekong River fishes across a natural riverine barrier,"Impacts of urban development on aquatic populations are often complex and difficult to ascertain, but population genetic analysis has allowed researchers to monitor and estimate gene flow in the context of existing and future hydroelectric projects. The Lower Mekong Basin is undergoing rapid hydroelectric development with around 50 completed and under-construction dams and 95 planned dams. The authors investigated the baseline genetic diversity of two exploited migratory fishes, the mud carpHenicorhynchus lobatus(five locations), and the rat-faced pangasiid catfish,Helicophagus leptorhynchus(two locations), in the Lower Mekong Basin using the genomic double digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing method. In both species, fish sampled upstream of Khone Falls were differentiated from those collected at other sites, andN(e)estimates at the site above the falls were lower than those at other sites. This was the first study to utilize thousands of RAD-generated single nucleotide polymorphisms to indicate that the Mekong's Khone Falls are a potential barrier to gene flow for these two moderately migratory species. The recent completion of the Don Sahong dam across one of the only channels for migratory fishes through Khone Falls may further exacerbate signatures of isolation and continue to disrupt the migration patterns of regionally vital food fishes. In addition,H. lobatuspopulations downstream of Khone Falls, including the 3S Basin and Tonle Sap system, displayed robust connectivity. Potential obstruction of migration pathways between these river systems resulting from future dam construction may limit dispersal, which has led to elevated inbreeding rates and even local extirpation in other fragmented riverine species.",dams; fishes; fragmentation; Khone Falls; Mekong River; population genetics,"Biesack, EE; Dang, BT; Ackiss, AS; Bird, CE; Chheng, P; Phounvisouk, L; Truong, OT; Carpenter, KE",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,10.1111/jfb.14424,"[Biesack, Ellen E.; Ackiss, Amanda S.; Carpenter, Kent E.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Dang, Binh T.; Truong, Oanh T.] Nha Trang Univ, Inst Biotechnol & Environm, Nha Trang, Vietnam; [Bird, Christopher E.] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Life Sci, Corpus Christi, TX USA; [Chheng, Phen] Inland Fisheries Res & Dev Inst, Fisheries Adm, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Phounvisouk, Latsamy] Living Aquat Resources Res Ctr, Viangchan, Laos",WILEY,English,0022-1112,

Moreover, UV-visible absorption spectrum among 190-1100 nm and the glass optical parameters were measured. The optical energy gap (E-g), the single-oscillator energy (E-o), the dispersion energy parameter (E-d), refractive index (n), and refractive dispersion index (no) were estimated. The obtained results indicated that (E-g) was decreased with increasing La(2)O(3)content, but the refractive index (n) was increased. The addition of La(2)O(3)to glass network could provide preferable shielding features. The chosen amount of La and another metal oxide has been added to the glass. Shielding parameters such as half-value layer (HVL), mean free path (MFP), mass attenuation coefficient (MAC), and exposure rate in the photon energy range 15-300 keV have been simulated by MicroShield software.

Methods A cardiac phantom with a simulated PD was imaged under differentRusing different gamma cameras and reconstruction algorithms. The residual activity from precedent stress administration was simulated by modeling effective half-times in each compartment of the phantom and assuming a delay of 3 hours between the stress and rest studies. The net contrast (NC) of the PD in the rest study was assessed for differentR, PD positions and scanner/software combinations. The optimalRwill be the one that minimize the NC in the rest images Results The activity concentration ratioR, the position of the PD and the scanner/software combinations were all main effects with a statistically significant impact on the NC, in decreasing order of relevance. The NC diminished significantly only forRvalues up to 2. No further improvement was observed for NC forRvalues above 2 and up to 3. NC was significantly higher in anteroseptal than in posterolateral positions of the PD and higher for solid-state cameras. Conclusions A rest-stress activity concentration ratioRof 2 in single-day stress-first myocardial perfusion imaging is enough to achieve the maximum net contrast in the PD.

WoS,The Experiences of Bereaved Parents After the Loss of a Child to Cancer: A Qualitative Metasynthesis,"This study aims to synthesize qualitative evidence about the bereavement experience of parents following the death of a child due to cancer. A qualitative metasynthesis was conducted from searching five databases. The search identified 650 articles that were independently assessed by two reviewers. Thirty-one articles were selected for full-text reading and assessed for eligibility; a total of 14 articles were included in the final sample and submitted to quality appraisal. The software NVivo (R) was used to organize the data and support the thematic analysis procedures. Two analytical themes were constructed: (1) losing a child and facing a rupture in identity and sense of life and (2) surviving grief and reengaging in life. The grief process was dynamic, continuous, and begun before the death of the child. Fathers and mothers reacted differently to the loss and experience of grief. The loss of a child definitively changed the parents' life and caused identity crisis and loss of life's purpose. During the process of survival, parents constructed new meanings that helped them cope with grief; they used strategies that allowed them to recover their sense of purpose in life. Synthesizing the experience of bereaved parents is essential to improve the support families of children with advanced cancer receive to better cope with their suffering and loss, before and after the child's death.",bereavement; parents; childhood cancer; qualitative research; nursing,"Polita, NB; de Montigny, F; Neris, RR; Alvarenga, WD; Silva-Rodrigues, FM; Leite, ACAB; Nascimento, LC",2020.0,ReviewEA,JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY NURSING,10.1177/1043454220944059,"[Polita, Naiara Barros] Univ Sao Paulo Ribeirao Preto, Coll Nursing, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Neris, Rhyquelle Rhibna; Leite, Ana Carolina Andrade Biaggi; Nascimento, Lucila Castanheira] Univ Sao Paulo Ribeirao Preto, Coll Nursing, WHO Collaborating Ctr Nursing Res Dev, Ave Bandeirantes,3900,Campus Univ, BR-14040920 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Polita, Naiara Barros; de Montigny, Francine] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [de Montigny, Francine] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Nursing, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [de Montigny, Francine] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Family Psychosocial Hlth, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Alvarenga, Willyane de Andrade] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Ctr Etud & Rech Intervent Familiale Canada, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Silva-Rodrigues, Fernanda Machado] Santa Casa Sao Paulo Sch Med Sci, Pediat Nursing, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,English,1043-4542,
WoS,Molecular phylogeny and species delimitation of Stachyuraceae: Advocating a herbarium specimen-based phylogenomic approach in resolving species boundaries,"Species concept and delimitation are fundamental to taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Both inadequate informative sites in the molecular data and limited taxon sampling have often led to poor phylogenetic resolution and incorrect species delineation. Recently, the whole chloroplast genome sequences from extensive herbarium specimen samples have been shown to be effective to amend the problem. Stachyuraceae are a small family consisting of only one genusStachyurusof six to 16 species. However, species delimitation inStachyurushas been highly controversial because of few and generally unstable morphological characters used for classification. In this study, we sampled 69 individuals of seven species (each with at least three individuals) covering the entire taxonomic diversity, geographic range, and morphological variation ofStachyurusfrom herbarium specimens for genome-wide plastid gene sequencing to address species delineation in the genus. We obtained high-quality DNAs from specimens using a recently developed DNA reconstruction technique. We first assembled four whole chloroplast genome sequences. Based on the chloroplast genome and one nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence ofStachyurus, we designed primers for multiplex polymerase chain reaction and high throughput sequencing of 44 plastid loci for species ofStachyurus. Data of these chloroplast DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer sequences were used for phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenetic results showed that the Japanese speciesStachyurus praecoxSiebold & Zucc. was sister to the rest in mainland China, which indicated a typical Sino-Japanese distribution pattern. Based on diagnostic morphological characters, distinct distributional range, and monophyly of each clade, we redefined seven species forStachyurusfollowing an integrative species concept, and revised the taxonomy of the family based on previous reports and specimens, in particular the type specimens. Furthermore, our divergence time estimation results suggested that Stachyuraceae split from its sister group Crossosomataceae from the New World at ca. 54.29 Mya, but extant species of Stachyuraceae started their diversification only recently at ca. 6.85 Mya. Diversification time ofStachyurusin mainland China was estimated to be ca. 4.45 Mya.

WoS,Stability analysis and optimal control strategies of direct and indirect transmission dynamics of conjunctivitis,"This article concerns theS-E-I-R(Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) mathematical model formulation describing the dynamics of the spread of conjunctivitis predominant in human host population. The model considered possesses two equilibrium points, namely, the conjunctivitis-free and conjunctivitis-present equilibrium, which are dependent on the basic reproduction number (R-co). The local and global stabilities of derived model system were investigated at the equilibrium solutions, and it was found that ifR(co) < 1, the conjunctivitis-free equilibrium is both locally and globally asymptotically stable. Also, ifR(co) > 1, the conjunctivitis-present equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. The sensitivity analysis ofR(co)is performed, and the corresponding graphical results are presented to examine the relative importance of conjunctivitis model parameters as to conjunctivitis prevalence. The model is reformulated by applying control measures of isolation and hygiene compliance to minimize conjunctivitis infection and irritants concentration as well as the cost associated with it. An optimality system is derived and numerically solved with and without controls using the forward-backward Runge-Kutta scheme via computational software MATLAB. The graphical results obtained showed that each of the control strategies has its own importance for conjunctivitis elimination. Further graphical descriptions reveal that the combination of isolation and hygiene compliance strategies are more effective in curtailing conjunctivitis prevalence in human and environmental host community.",conjunctivitis; optimal control; stability analysis,"Ogunmiloro, OM",2020.0,JournalEA,MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES,10.1002/mma.6756,"[Ogunmiloro, Oluwatayo Michael] Ekiti State Univ, Dept Math, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria",WILEY,English,0170-4214,
WoS,Microsatellite development and detection of admixture among three sympatricHaploblepharusspecies (Carcharhiniformes: Scyliorhinidae),"Haploblepharusis an understudied genus comprising four recognized scyliorhinid species that are endemic to southern Africa. Species identification within this group has historically been problematic due to a high degree of morphological conservatism among congeners, further complicated by the possibility of interspecific hybridization. This study describes the development of two microsatellite panels comprising 10 polymorphic markers for the puffadder shyshark,Haploblepharus edwardsii. The markers were characterized in 35H. edwardsiispecimens and tested for cross-species utility inHaploblepharus fuscus,Haploblepharus pictus, and the more distantly related scyliorhinidHalaelurus natalensis. Genetic diversity statistics were estimated for each species, and the presence of population differentiation was tested for inH. edwardsiiandH. pictus. Furthermore, interspecific genetic differentiation was examined to infer the potential use of these markers for species identification as well as for detecting signatures of admixture amongHaploblepharusspecies. All microsatellite markers were polymorphic in each species, with polymorphism information contents ranging from 0.43 to 0.62. Population differentiation was only evident forH. pictus, where genetic discontinuity was detected among geographically distant sampling sites. Statistically significant differentiation (fixation index between populationsF(ST)= 0.091 to 0.382) was found between all species; however, the level of differentiation betweenH. fuscusandH. pictuswas low in comparison and seemingly at a population level rather than at a species level. Species assignment using Bayesian clustering analysis resulted in approximately 57% of 88 genotyped specimens being unambiguously assigned to a distinct genetic cluster that confirmed accurate taxonomic assignment. Overall, the low levels of differentiation together with the presence of distinct and admixed genetic clusters suggests a recent divergence and possible contemporary hybridization within the genusHaploblepharus.As such, conservation strategies should be focused on the generic level until such a time thatHaploblepharusspecies can be readily identified.",biodiversity; fishing; genetics; ocean; recreation; trawling,"van Staden, M; Gledhill, KS; Gennari, E; McCord, ME; Parkinson, M; Watson, RGA; Rhode, C; van der Merwe, AEB",2020.0,JournalEA,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,10.1002/aqc.3406,"[van Staden, Michaela; Gledhill, Katie Samantha; Rhode, Clint; van der Merwe, Aletta Elizabeth] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Genet, Mol Breeding & Biodivers Res Grp, Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa; [Gledhill, Katie Samantha] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Fish Ecol Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gledhill, Katie Samantha; McCord, Meaghen Erica] South African Shark Conservancy, Hermanus, Western Cape, South Africa; [Gennari, Enrico] Oceans Res, Mossel Bay, Western Cape, South Africa; [Gennari, Enrico; Parkinson, Matthew; Watson, Ralph Gareth Andrew] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa; [Gennari, Enrico; Parkinson, Matthew; Watson, Ralph Gareth Andrew] Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa",WILEY,English,1052-7613,
WoS,Post-hoc physiological waveform extraction from motion estimation in simultaneous multislice (SMS) functional MRI using separate stack processing,"Purpose Motion estimation is an essential step in functional MRI (fMRI) preprocessing. Usually, fMRI processing software packages (eg, FSL and AFNI) automatically estimate motion parameters in order to counteract the effects of motion. However, the time courses of the motion estimation for fMRI data also contain information about physiological processes. Here, we show that respiration and cardiac signals can be extracted from motion estimation at significantly higher bandwidth than is possible with current methods. Method To detect motion at high effective temporal resolution (HighRes), the motion parameters of stacks of simultaneously acquired slices were estimated separately, then combined. This method was validated by extracting physiological motion signals from resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data (Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample) and comparing them to respiration belt and pulse oximeter signals. Results HighRes motion time-courses with an effective sampling rate of 15.5 and 11.4 Hz were extracted from repetition time (TR) = 0.645 and 1.4 s data, respectively. Respiration waveforms were extracted with significantly higher accuracy than the original motion parameters. Even cardiac waveforms could be extracted, despite the fact that the sampling time or TR values were too long to sample cardiac frequencies. Conclusion HighRes motion traces provide insight into the subjects' motion at higher frequencies than can be estimated using standard techniques. In its simplest form, this technique can recover accurate respiration signals and may reveal additional complexity in brain motion.",cardiac; effective sample rate; multiband (MB); physiology; post-processing; respiration,"Hocke, LM; Frederick, BB",2020.0,JournalEA,MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,10.1002/mrm.28418,"[Hocke, Lia M.; Frederick, Blaise B.] McLean Hosp, McLean Imaging Ctr, 115 Mill St, Belmont, MA 02478 USA; [Hocke, Lia M.; Frederick, Blaise B.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA",WILEY,English,0740-3194,
WoS,Diagnostic accuracy of two-dimensional coronary angiographic-derived fractional flow reserve-Preliminary results,"Aim Noninvasive fractional flow reserve (NiFFR) is an emerging method for evaluating the functional significance of a coronary lesion during diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG). The method relies on the computational flow dynamics and the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the vessel extracted from CAG. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the diagnostic performance and applicability of 2D-based NiFFR. Methods In this prospective observational study, we evaluated 2D-based NiFFR in 279 candidates for invasive CAG and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR). NiFFR was calculated via two methods: variable NiFFR, in which the contrast transport time was extracted from the angiographic view, and fixed NiFFR, in which a prespecified frame count was applied. Results The final analysis was performed on 245 patients (250 lesions). Variable NiFFR had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 81.5%, an accuracy of 80.0%, a sensitivity of 82.2%, a specificity of 82.2%, a negative predictive value of 91.4%, and a positive predictive value of 63.6%. The mean difference between FFR and NiFFR was -0.0244 +/-.0616 (p <=.0001). A pressure wire-free hybrid strategy was possible in 68.8% of our population with variable NiFFR. Conclusions Our 2D-based NiFFR yielded results comparable to those derived from 3D-based software.

WoS,Viral metagenomics analysis of kidney donors and recipients: Torque teno virus genotyping and prevalence,"The viral load of the ubiquitous and nonpathogenic torque teno virus (TTV) is associated with the grade of immunosuppression of its host. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allowed to describe the human virome of the blood compartment in transplanted patients, and showed that TTV is the most important part of the virome. This study is a descriptive retrospective pilot study of sequencing plasma samples from 15 matched donors and recipients. Descriptive retrospective pilot study of sequencing plasma samples from 15 matched donors and recipients. After sample processing, nucleic acids were amplified by rolling circle amplification and submitted to NGS by ion proton sequencing technology. Results were analyzed after mapping of reads on the 29 TTV reference genomes and de novo assembling of the reads with MIRA software. The number of TTV species present in donors and recipients was, on average, 12 in donors and 33 in recipients. TTV species predominantly present in donors were TTV-13 and TTV-18; and in recipients were TTV-P15-2, TTV-27, TTV-HD14a, and TTV-22. We highlighted a significant variability in abundance and composition in sequential samples from recipients. Temporal evolution of TTV populations was clearly observed in recipients, but no preferential transmission of a species from donor to recipient was evidenced.

WoS,"Immunohistochemical study of STAT3, HIF-1 alpha and VEGF in pterygium and normal conjunctiva: Experimental research and literature review","Purpose: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a DNA-binding protein that regulates various biologic processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and malignant transformation. Abnormal activation of STAT3 is associated with many diseases, and there is currently no relevant study on the pathogenesis of pterygium. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and clinical significance of STAT3, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF in pterygium at different stages. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression levels of STAT3, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF in 50 cases of pterygium and 20 cases of control conjunctival tissue. The expression intensity of the three proteins was evaluated with Image-Pro Plus 6.0 image analysis software. Results: In the pterygium group, the positive rates for STAT3, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF were 82.0%, 86.0%, and 84.0%, respectively, while those in the normal conjunctiva group were 40.0%, 25.0%, and 15.0%. The expression of STAT3, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF in pterygium was higher than that in control conjunctiva, and the expression in advanced pterygium was statistically significantly higher than that in stationary pterygium (p < 0.01). The expression levels of STAT3 and HIF-1 alpha in pterygium were related to the length and depth of the corneal invasion of pterygium. The expression level of VEGF in pterygium was related to the length of pterygium, but not to the depth. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the expression of STAT3, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF (p < 0.01). Conclusions: For the first time, the expression levels of the STAT3, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF proteins were detected simultaneously in pterygium tissue. Compared with normal conjunctiva, STAT3, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF were highly expressed in pterygium, and the expression in advanced pterygium tissue was more significant than in the stationary pterygium tissue. It is suggested that STAT3 may directly or through HIF-1 alpha promote VEGF expression and participate in the growth and angiogenesis of pterygium. Targeting STAT3 may provide a new direction for the treatment of pterygium.",,"Dong, SQ; Wu, XY; Xu, YT; Yang, GH; Yan, M",2020.0,Review,MOLECULAR VISION,,"[Dong, Shiqi; Wu, Xiying; Xu, Yuting; Yan, Ming] Wuhan Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Zhongnan Hosp, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guohua] Wuhan Univ, Demonstrat Ctr Expt Basic Med Educ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",MOLECULAR VISION,English,1090-0535,

WoS,A multi-stage material model calibration procedure for enhancing numerical solution fidelity in the case of impact loading of composites,"The numerical prediction of impact-induced damage to composite materials and the subsequent residual strength under compression loading continue to be a challenging task. The current study proposes a calibration routine for optimizing the set of material model parameters prior to the virtual simulation of impact tests, which also simplifies the process of parameter determination. The calibration algorithm is based on the comparison of the numerical force-strain or force-displacement curves with the corresponding experimental ones to get the optimal input data, and it includes basic quasi-static material characterization tests. For the sake of simplicity, the calibration process was divided into two parts. The first part includes the in-plane loading tests (tension 0 degrees & 90 degrees, compression 0 degrees & 90 degrees, shear and open-hole tension) for calibration of orthotropic damage material model; whereas the second one consists of the mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture tests as well as the short beam shear test, and it mainly targets to the adjustment of cohesive model parameters. Given the optimal set of parameters of material models, low and high velocity impact simulations at the energy level of 30 J were carried-out to LS-DYNA software and compared with experiments. The percentage difference between numerical and experimental delamination area, after the calibration enablement, reduced from 77% and 60% to 10% and 25% for low- and high-velocity impact, respectively. Afterwards, the damaged specimens were experimentally and virtually tested to compression loading. In terms of maximum compressive load, the computational error is close to 1% for both impact conditions.",Material model calibration; finite element method; impact loading; compression after impact; Cycom 977-2,"Giannaros, E; Kotzakolios, A; Sotiriadis, G; Kostopoulos, V",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS,10.1177/0021998320944992,"[Giannaros, Efthimios; Kotzakolios, Athanasios; Sotiriadis, George; Kostopoulos, Vassilis] Univ Patras, Dept Mech Engn & Aeronaut, Appl Mech & Vibrat Lab, Patras Univ Campus, GR-26500 Patras, Greece",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,English,0021-9983,
WoS,Augmented reality for base plate component placement in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty: a feasibility study,"Background Accurate glenoid positioning in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is important to achieve satisfying functional outcome and prosthesis longevity. Optimal component placement can be challenging, especially in severe glenoid deformities. The use of patient-specific instruments (PSI) and 3D computer-assisted optical tracking navigation (NAV) are already established methods to improve surgical precision. Augmented reality technology (AR) promises similar results at low cost and ease of use. With AR, the planned component placement can be superimposed to the surgical situs and shown directly in the operating field using a head mounted display. We introduce a new navigation technique using AR via head mounted display for surgical navigation in this feasibility study, aiming to improve and enhance the surgical planning. Methods 3D surface models of ten human scapulae were printed from computed tomography (CT) data of cadaver scapulae. Guidewire positioning of the central back of the glenoid baseplate was planned with a dedicated computer software. A hologram of the planned guidewire with dynamic navigation was then projected onto the 3D-created models of the cadaver shoulders. The registration of the plan to the anatomy was realized by digitizing the glenoid surface and the base of the coracoid with optical tracking using a fiducial marker. After navigated placement of the central guidewires, another CT imaging was recorded, and the 3D model was superimposed with the preoperative planning to analyze the deviation from the planned and executed central guides trajectory and entry point. Results The mean deviation of the ten placed guidewires from the planned trajectory was 2.7 degrees +/- 1.3 degrees (95% CI 1.9 degrees; 3.6 degrees). The mean deviation to the planned entry point of the ten placed guidewires measured 2.3 mm +/- 1.1 mm (95% CI 1.5 mm; 3.1 mm).

WoS,Pressure reduction mechanism and effect of working face passing through abandoned roadway by roof presplit,"Due to the existence of abandoned roadways in the thick coal seam, the ground pressure would increase greatly due to the roof advanced breaking when the working face passed through the affected area of abandoned roadways. In order to solve this problem, a solution for roof presplit in the abandoned roadway was proposed. Based on the mining and geological conditions of Huasheng Hufeng coal mine, the roof vertical stress and vertical displacement with different roof presplit distance were analyzed by using FLAC3D numerical software. The research results indicated that the roof vertical stress and vertical displacement could be reduced effectively by roof presplit. When the roof presplit distance was 15 m, the maximum vertical stress and the maximum vertical displacement were both minimum. The maximum vertical stress was reduced by 14.55% and the maximum vertical displacement was reduced by 37.51% after roof presplit. The reasonable roof presplit distance of the working face was determined to be about 15 m by combining theoretical and numerical analysis. The engineering application results indicated that the maximum working resistance of the hydraulic support was reduced by 35.86% after roof presplit, and the engineering effect was good.

This growing demand creates opportunities for very small entities (VSEs) to not only survive but also flourish. In this context, VSEs need to produce high-quality products to meet market needs. However, in their quest to produce high-quality software, VSEs need to overcome the challenge of implementing international standards, which they find difficult to do because of lack of knowledge and practical experience. This paper provides an analysis performed to 13 teams of VSEs, using different life cycles, which achieved the implementation of the ISO/IEC 29110, to analyze the effort each team invests to implement the best practices provided by the standard. Besides, the paper provides an analysis of the difficulties, and the benefits of using the six-step method are included. This analysis is of interest because software engineering knowledge developed by researchers should be transferred to the industry to reduce the gap between them.

WoS,TeraChem: A graphical processing unit-acceleratedelectronic structure package forlarge-scaleab initio molecular dynamics,"TeraChem was born in 2008 with the goal of providing fast on-the-fly electronic structure calculations to facilitate ab initio molecular dynamics studies of large biochemical systems such as photoswitchable proteins and multichromophoric antenna complexes. Originally developed for videogaming applications, graphics processing units (GPUs) offered a low-cost parallel computer architecture that became more accessible for general-purpose GPU computing with the release of CUDA in 2007. The evaluation of the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) is a major bottleneck in electronic structure codes and provides an attractive target for acceleration on GPUs. Thus, highly efficient routines for evaluation of and contractions between the ERIs and density matrices were implemented in TeraChem. Electronic structure methods were developed and implemented to leverage these integral contraction routines, resulting in the first quantum chemistry package designed from the ground up for GPUs. This GPU acceleration makes TeraChem capable of performing large-scale ground and excited state calculations in the gas and condensed phase. Today, TeraChem's speed forms the basis for a suite of quantum chemistry applications, including optimization and dynamics of proteins, automated and interactive chemical discovery tools, and large-scale nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.

By utilizing response surface methodology, two variables have been considered in developing R-ECC mixtures which are the amount of crumb rubber replacement to fine aggregate by volume 0-5% and PVA fibres from 0 to 2% by volume of cementitious materials. Experimental data show that the incorporation of crumb rubber into ECC results in decreasing its compressive strength and elastic modulus. A significant increase in Poisson's ratio and drying shrinkage was reported with the incorporation of crumb rubber. Design-Expert software has been utilized to construct predictive models for the responses. The goodness of fit between the measured and predicted values is validated using the coefficient of determination. Results of numerical optimizations showed that the best mixture was obtained by combining 1.92% of crumb rubber with 1.86% of PVA fibres.

WoS,Two-dimensional pitted corrosion localization on coated steel based on fiber Bragg grating sensors,"Steel is widely used as building material for large-scale structures, such as buildings, bridges, and oil and gas pipelines, due to its high strength-to-weight ratio. Corrosion has been believed to be one of the main reasons for reducing the load carrying capacity and the service life of structural steel, especially for the structures in harsh service environments. To mitigate corrosion for structural steel, coatings have been widely applied. On the other hand, to monitor corrosion in real time, embedding fiber Bragg grating (FBG) inside the coatings becomes a potential solution for coated steel structures. However, due to the fact that FBG sensors are local point sensors, the localization of pitted corrosion based on these sensors is very challenging. In this study, a methodology based on a three-sensor network was set up to detect the location and severity of the pitted corrosion on steel structures in two dimension (2D). The 2D simply supported plate theory together with the numerical simulation based on finite element analysis (ANSYS software) was used to derive the transfer function of the pitted corrosion location to the FBG sensor reading. Depending on the parametric study through numerical analysis, a pitted corrosion location exhaustion algorithm was successfully programmed. To verify the feasibility of this algorithm, laboratory experiments were carried out using a steel pipe with three FBG sensors and a temperature compensation sensor embedded inside a layer of epoxy coating (Duralco 4461).

This study aimed to evaluate in patients a highly automatic Yale-MQ (myocardial blood flow quantification) software incorporated with a novel image segmentation approach for quantification of global and regional MBF and MFR from dynamic(82)Rb cardiac positron emission tomography (PET). Methods Global and regional MBFs and MFRs were quantified in 80 patients (18 normal and 62 CAD subjects) by two different observers using the Yale-MQ software. Lower limits of normal (LLN) values and intra- and inter-observer variabilities of MBFs and MFRs were calculated for the assessment of quantitative precision. The Yale-MQ was compared with a commercially available software (Corridor 4DM) being used as a reference. Results The Yale-MQ method provided precise assessments of LLNs of MBF and MFR. The global and regional MBFs and MFR quantified via Yale-MQ were correlated strongly with those via Corridor4DM (R >= 0.867). The intra- and inter-observer variabilities of MBFs and MFRs quantified via Yale-MQ were small (<= 7.7% for MBFs and <= 10.0% for MFRs) with excellent correlations (R >= 0.980 for MBFs andR >= 0.976 for MFRs). Conclusions The new Yale-MQ software associated with the automatic processing scheme provides a highly reproducible clinical tool for precise quantification of MBF and MFR in patients with reliable LLN values.,Myocardial blood flow; Dynamic(82)Rb PET; Observer variability; Lower limit of normal,"Liu, H; Thorn, S; Wu, J; Fazzone-Chettiar, R; Sandoval, V; Miller, EJ; Sinusas, AJ; Liu, YH",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY,10.1007/s12350-020-02278-y,"[Liu, Hui; Thorn, Stephanie; Miller, Edward J.; Sinusas, Albert J.; Liu, Yi-Hwa] Yale Univ, Dept Internal Med, Sch Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Liu, Hui; Wu, Jing; Miller, Edward J.; Sinusas, Albert J.] Yale Univ, Dept Radiol & Biomed Imaging, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Fazzone-Chettiar, Ramesh; Sandoval, Veronica; Miller, Edward J.; Sinusas, Albert J.; Liu, Yi-Hwa] Yale New Haven Med Ctr, Heart & Vasc Ctr, Dept Nucl Cardiol, 20 York St, New Haven, CT 06504 USA; [Liu, Yi-Hwa] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Taoyuan, Taiwan",SPRINGER,English,1071-3581,

WoS,Percutaneous nephrolithotomy versus flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy in the treatment of upper urinary tract stones: a meta-analysis comparing clinical efficacy and safety,"Background Upper urinary tract stones is the most common diseases in urology. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and ureteroscopic lithotripsy (fURL) are common treatment, but both their efficacy and safety are controversial. Thus we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PCNL and fURL in the treatment of upper urinary tract stones, providing a reference for clinical work. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and CNKI were searched through Apr. 1, 2019 to identify eligible studies. Data were analyzed by using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software. Pooled relative risks (RRs) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed or random effects methods. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were performed. Results Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), fifteen cohort studies involving 1822 patients were included. Stone-free rate of PCNL was significantly high than that of fURL (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.12;P = 0.0004). The decline of hemoglobin in PCNL was significantly high than that of fURL (WMD: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.61;P < 0.0001). The number of blood transfusion was significantly greater in the PCNL compared to the fURL (RR: 5.04; 95% CI: 1.78, 14.24;P = 0.002). The incidence of postoperative bleeding or hematuria showed greater significantly difference in the PCNL compared to the fURL (RR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.55, 4.75;P = 0.0005). Operation time, fever, infection, perforation, requiring drug analgesia was not significantly different between two surgical procedures.

WoS,Deep learning-based behavioral analysis reaches human accuracy and is capable of outperforming commercial solutions,"To study brain function, preclinical research heavily relies on animal monitoring and the subsequent analyses of behavior. Commercial platforms have enabled semi high-throughput behavioral analyses by automating animal tracking, yet they poorly recognize ethologically relevant behaviors and lack the flexibility to be employed in variable testing environments. Critical advances based on deep-learning and machine vision over the last couple of years now enable markerless tracking of individual body parts of freely moving rodents with high precision. Here, we compare the performance of commercially available platforms (EthoVision XT14, Noldus; TSE Multi-Conditioning System, TSE Systems) to cross-verified human annotation. We provide a set of videos-carefully annotated by several human raters-of three widely used behavioral tests (open field test, elevated plus maze, forced swim test). Using these data, we then deployed the pose estimation software DeepLabCut to extract skeletal mouse representations. Using simple post-analyses, we were able to track animals based on their skeletal representation in a range of classic behavioral tests at similar or greater accuracy than commercial behavioral tracking systems. We then developed supervised machine learning classifiers that integrate the skeletal representation with the manual annotations. This new combined approach allows us to score ethologically relevant behaviors with similar accuracy to humans, the current gold standard, while outperforming commercial solutions. Finally, we show that the resulting machine learning approach eliminates variation both within and between human annotators. In summary, our approach helps to improve the quality and accuracy of behavioral data, while outperforming commercial systems at a fraction of the cost.",,"Sturman, O; von Ziegler, L; Schlappi, C; Akyol, F; Privitera, M; Slominski, D; Grimm, C; Thieren, L; Zerbi, V; Grewe, B; Bohacek, J",2020.0,JournalEA,NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,10.1038/s41386-020-0776-y,"[Sturman, Oliver; von Ziegler, Lukas; Schlaeppi, Christa; Akyol, Furkan; Privitera, Mattia; Slominski, Daria; Bohacek, Johannes] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Lab Mol & Behav Neurosci, Inst Neurosci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sturman, Oliver; von Ziegler, Lukas; Schlaeppi, Christa; Akyol, Furkan; Privitera, Mattia; Slominski, Daria; Grimm, Christina; Thieren, Laetitia; Zerbi, Valerio; Grewe, Benjamin; Bohacek, Johannes] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Neurosci Ctr Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sturman, Oliver; von Ziegler, Lukas; Schlaeppi, Christa; Akyol, Furkan; Privitera, Mattia; Slominski, Daria; Grimm, Christina; Thieren, Laetitia; Zerbi, Valerio; Grewe, Benjamin; Bohacek, Johannes] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Grimm, Christina; Zerbi, Valerio] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Neural Control Movement Lab, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Thieren, Laetitia] Univ Zurich, Inst Pharmacol & Toxicol, Expt Imaging & Neuroenerget, Zurich, Switzerland; [Grewe, Benjamin] Univ Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Grewe, Benjamin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Grewe, Benjamin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Informat Technol & Elect Engn, Zurich, Switzerland",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,English,0893-133X,

WoS,Symmetrical DC-Link Capacitor Voltage for Multi Solar PV Array Fed CHBMLI in Standalone Application,"In this paper, a generalized algorithm is proposed to balance the DC-link (DCL) voltage across each power cell ofnnumber of cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter (CHBMLI), using dc-dc converter, fed from multi solar photovoltaic (SPV) array for standalone application under varying environmental conditions,i.e.variation in radiation and temperature. Due to variation in the environmental conditions, the power flow through each H-bridge modules changes and subsequently the DCL voltage might change. This leads to unequal DC levels in the pole voltage of the CHBMLI, which results in different switching stress of the power modules. Therefore, the life span of the switches will get reduced. To maintain equal switching stress on each H-bridge module, duty cycle of the boost DC to DC converters is varied according to the proposed algorithm. It maintains equal voltage at the output of the boost converter under uniform/non-uniform environmental conditions. To operate the CHBMLI, the triangular carrier phase-shifted modulation has been used. The proposed algorithm as well as performance of the multi-SPV fed CHBMLI is simulated using PSCAD/EMTDC software for three-bridge seven-level CHBMLI.

The poroelastic mechanical signals (pore pressure, fluid velocity, von-Mises stress, strain) were analyzed inside the osteon-osteocyte system. The effects of osteocyte (OCY)'s shape (ellipse and circle), long axis directions (horizontal and vertical) and mechanical properties (Elastic modulus and permeability) on its poroelastic responses were examined. It is found that the OCY processes is the best mechanosensor compared with the OCY body, lacunae and canaliculi. The mechanotransduction ability of the elliptic shaped OCY is stronger than that of circular shaped. The pore pressure and flow velocity around OCYs increase as the elastic modulus and permeability of OCY increase.

To do this, strain gauges are embedded in different positions inside concrete, and the stress and strain values at different positions inside the concrete are measured using the rolling fatigue test. A numerical model is established using COMSOL Multiphysics software, and the concrete internal stress and strain values are simulated. A comparison between the calculated and measured values shows that the numerical model can simulate the actual stress state inside the concrete. The numerical model can predict the internal stress and strain variation of concrete specimens under more complicated load conditions. The prediction results show that under the same fatigue load conditions, the concrete stress peak is hardly affected by the fatigue loading times, but there is a marked increase in the strain value inside the specimen. When the stress peak of concrete does not reach its design strength, an excessive increase of the internal strain will cause hidden damage to the concrete.

Based on the strain characteristics in the rolling, evaluation indices of deformation uniformity were provided, and the DEFORM-3D software was adopted to conduct numerical simulations of the rolling process. The metal flow and strain distribution in all stages of the rolling process were analyzed. It is shown that the strain value of the rolled piece close to the end is relatively high while the overall strain distribution is uniform in the rolling process. When the percentage reduction in area is smaller, the fluctuation range of the equivalent strain will be lower and the overall uniformity of the rolled piece will be better. A variable angle wedge was implemented to make metal flow inward and eliminate concavity. Finally, rolling experiment was performed, which indicate that the shape of the rolled piece obtained is consistent with the simulation results. Concavity value in the rolling is decreased by 92% as compared to conventional open rolling.

In order to deal with these challenges, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is regarded as a promising solution. MEC pushes powerful computational and storage capacities from the remote cloud to the edge of networks in close proximity of vehicular users, which enables low latency and reduced bandwidth consumption. Driven by the benefits of MEC, many efforts have been devoted to integrating vehicular networks into MEC, thereby forming a novel paradigm named as Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC).

WoS,Experimental evaluation of dynamic resource orchestration in multi-layer (packet over flexi-grid optical) networks,"Network services in 5G will be rolled out as pools of virtual network functions (VNFs) exploiting the advantages of both software-defined networking and network function virtualization. In this context, 5G network services are envisaged as ordered sequences of VNFs resulting in the so-called VNF Forwarding Graphs (VNFFGs). Such VNFs can be allocated over a number of distributed but interconnected data centers (DCs). In this work, a cloud/network orchestrator is discussed to dynamically process and accommodate VNFFG requests over a pool of DCs interconnected by a multi-layer (packet/flexi-grid optical) transport network infrastructure. Two different cloud and network resource allocation algorithms are proposed aiming at: (1) minimizing the distance between the selected DCs and (2) minimizing the load (i.e., consumed cloud resources) of the chosen DCs.

WoS,A portable electrocardiogram for real-time monitoring of cardiac signals,"This study presents an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and processing system which can observe subjects in real time and display the resultant ECG signals on a computer for observation. The primary application is for the remote observation of cardiac patients. This paper aims to determine its reliability by analysing its portability and wireless connectivity. The system is comprised of three principal units, namely the data acquisition circuit, where cardiac electrical signals are detected using three surface electrodes placed at three different positions on the chest wall to follow the Einthoven Triangle. The signals measured are amplified and filtered by components in a circuit and are then carried to a data processing unit where a ATmega328P microcontroller with a ZigBee interface module are used to transfer the biosignal wirelessly to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) unit which has the capacity to observe ECG biosignals on a computer. The results demonstrated that the design successfully produced a distortion-free signal, namely the hardware and software elements operated and intercommunicated correctly. In both LabVIEW and MATLAB configurations, the GUI characteristics were examined and found to yield unproblematic, user-friendly displays in real-time. Thus, this research provides a novel ECG system design to effectively analyse cardiac patients, however, it would be useful to develop a tool that can differentiate the various forms of cardiac arrhythmia.",ECG; ATmega328P; ADC; ZigBee; GUI; MATLAB; LabVIEW,"Ehnesh, M; Abatis, P; Schlindwein, FS",2020.0,Journal,SN APPLIED SCIENCES,10.1007/s42452-020-3065-9,"[Ehnesh, Mahmoud; Schlindwein, Fernando S.] Univ Leicester, Sch Engn, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Abatis, Panos] Coventry Univ, Dept Engn, Priory St, Coventry CV1 5FB, W Midlands, England",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,English,2523-3963,
WoS,Expression and evolution of the phospholipase C gene family inBrachypodium distachyon,"Background Phospholipase C (PLC) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phospholipids and plays an important role in plant growth and development. TheBrachypodium distachyonis a model plant of Gramineae, but the research on PLC gene family of Brachypodium has not been reported. Objective This study was performed to identify the PLC family gene in Brachypodium and to determine the expression profiles of PLCs under the abiotic stress. Methods Complete genome sequences and transcriptomes of Brachypodium were downloaded from the PLAZA. The hidden Markov model-based profile of the conserved PLC domain was submitted as a query to identify all potential PLC domain sequences with HMMER software. Expression profiles ofBdPLCswere obtained based on the qRT-PCR analysis. Results There were 8PLCgenes in Brachypodium (BdPI-PLCs1-4 andBdNPCs1-4). All members of BdPI-PLC had three conserved domains of X, Y, and C2, and no EF-hand was found. All BdNPCs contained a phosphatase domain.BdPI-PLCgenes were distributed on Chr1, Chr2 and Chr4, with different types and numbers of cis-regulatory elements in their respective gene promoters. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic relationship between Brachypodium and rice was closer than Arabidopsis. The expression patterns ofBdPI-PLCgene under abiotic stresses (drought, low temperature, high temperature and salt stress) were up-regulated, indicated their important roles in response to low temperature, high temperature, drought and salt stresses.

WoS,Using genetic algorithm to automate the generation of an open-plan office layout,"Today, the concept of open plan is more and more widely accepted that many companies have switched to open-plan offices. Their design is an issue in the scope of space layout planning. Although there are many professional architectural layout design software in the market, in the real life, office designers seldom use these tools because their license fees are usually expensive and using them to solve an open-plan office design is like using an overly powerful and expensive tool to fix a minor problem. Therefore, manual drafting through a trial and error process is most often used. This article attempts to propose a lightweight tool to automate open-plan office layout generation using a nested genetic algorithm optimization with two layers, where the inner layer algorithm is embedded in the outer one. The result is enhanced by a local search. The main objective is to maximize space utilization by maximizing the size of the open workspace. This approach is different from its precedents, in that the location search is conducted on a grid map rather than several pre-selected candidate locations. Consequently, the generated layout design presents a less rigid workstation arrangement, inviting a casual and unrestrictive work environment. The real potential of the approach is reflected in the productivity of test fits. Automating and simplifying the generation of layouts for test fits can tremendously decrease the amount of time and resources required to generate them. The experimental case study shows that the developed approach is powerful and effective, making it a totally automated process.",Automated process; office design; genetic algorithm; open-plan office; space layout planning,"Chen, C; Vega, RJC; Kong, TL",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTING,10.1177/1478077120943532,"[Chen, Chen] Nanyang Technol Univ, SJ NTU Corp Lab, ABN-B3a-02, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Chacon Vega, Ricardo Jose] CBRE Pte Ltd Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Kong, Tiong Lee] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,English,1478-0771,
WoS,A software-defined radio testbed for deep learning-based automatic modulation classification,"Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is the demodulation process on the receiver side, which is a crucial protocol for current and next-generation intelligent communication systems. This method becomes complicated, in the presence of channel noise, to identify the modulation of the transmitted signal, that is, the transmitter and receiver with its ambiguous parameters like timing information, signal strength, phase offset, and carrier frequency. Two fundamental approaches are used for the AMC, namely, the signal statistical feature-based approach and the maximum likelihood approach. Current Feature-Based AMC approaches typically built for a limited set of modulation; a comprehensive AMC approach utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN) is suggested in this article to overcome this obstacle. Altogether, 11 different types of modulations considered. In this method, without an extraction function, the transmitted signal can be identified directly. Also, the features of the received signal are known directly by using this method. The classification accuracy using CNN seems to be remarkable, especially for low SNRs. In this article, a realistic AMC framework that can be quickly applied to provide reliable efficiency in numerous commercial real-time scenarios has developed and tested. Therefore, to prove the functional viability of our proposed model, it was applied to the software-defined radio test-bed.",AMC; CNN; deep learning; SDR; testbed,"Ponnaluru, S; Penke, S",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS,10.1002/dac.4556,"[Ponnaluru, Sowjanya; Penke, Satyanarayana] Koneru Lakshmaiah Educ Fdn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Vaddeswaram, Andhra Pradesh, India",WILEY,English,1074-5351,

Based on stakeholder theory and institutional theory, this study examines the impact of public surveillance on corporate environmental innovation and the mediating role of environmental law enforcement. We selected 30 provinces in China as the research sample from 2011 to 2015. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data by Stata software. We found that public surveillance had a significant positive promoting effect on corporate radical eco-innovation, but had no significant effect on incremental eco-innovation; environmental law enforcement had a significant positive promoting effect on both radical and incremental eco-innovations. In addition, public surveillance was conducive to enhancing environmental law enforcement, which in turn promoted corporate radical eco-innovation.",environmental innovation; environmental law enforcement; incremental eco-innovation; public surveillance; radical eco- innovation,"Liao, ZJ; Weng, C; Shen, C",2020.0,JournalEA,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,10.1002/sd.2101,"[Liao, Zhongju; Weng, Chen; Shen, Chen] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China",WILEY,English,0968-0802,
WoS,Security assurance of MongoDB in singularity LXCs: an elastic and convenient testbed using Linux containers to explore vulnerabilities,"It is essential to ensure the data security of data analytical frameworks as any security vulnerability existing in the system can lead to a data loss or data breach. This vulnerability may occur due to attacks from live attackers as well as automated bots. However inside attacks are also becoming more frequent because of incorrectly implemented security requirements and access control policies. Thus, it is important to understand security goals and formulate security requirements and access control policies accordingly. Therefore, it is equally important to identify the existing security vulnerabilities of a given software system. To find the available vulnerabilities against any system, it is mandatory to conduct vulnerability assessments as scheduled tasks in a regular manner. Thus, an easily deployable, easily maintainable, accurate vulnerability assessment testbed or a model is helpful as facilitated by Linux containers. Nowadays Linux containers (LXCs) which have operating system level virtualization, are very popular over virtual machines (VMs) which have hypervisor or kernel level virtualization in high performance computing (HPC) due to reasons, such as high portability, high performance, efficiency and high security (Chae et al in Clust Comput 22:1765-1775, 2019. 10.1007/s10586-017-1511-2). Hence, LXCs can make an efficient and scalable vulnerability assessment testbed or a model by using already developed analyzing tools such as OpenVas, Dagda, PortSpider, MongoAudit, NMap, Metasploit Framework, Nessus, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy, and OpenSCAP, to assure the required security level of a given system very easily. To verify the overall security of any given software system, this paper first introduces a virtual, portable and easily deployable vulnerability assessment general testbed within the Linux container network. Next, the paper presents, how to conduct experiments using this testbed on a MongoDB database implemented in Singularity Linux containers to find the available vulnerabilities in 1. MongoDB application itself, 2. Images accompanied by containers, 3. Host, and 4.

WoS,Effects of peers and network position on user participation in a firm-hosted software community: the moderating role of network centrality,"Customers have become co-creators of value in software development and improvement. The intensifying integration of social networks and online communities requires an understanding of social influence on user participation. Drawing upon social capital theory, we studied the influence of peers and network position on user participation in a firm-hosted software community. Based on an analysis of longitudinal data on the knowledge seeking and knowledge contribution behaviours of 2,192 users, we found that an individual's quantity of friends' participation is positively related to his or her participation. The source credibility from expert friends' participation negatively affects user participation. We especially found that network centrality which depicts an individual's relative position in the network significantly moderates the effects of peers. Interestingly, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality exert different moderating effects on the peer effects. Closeness centrality strengthens the influence of friends' participation on knowledge seeking but has no effect on knowledge contribution. Betweenness centrality does not affect the effects of friends' participation. The effects of source credibility from expert friends are weaker for users with lower closeness centrality and higher betweenness centrality.

WoS,An Adaptive Ground Motion Prediction Equation for Use in Low-to-Moderate Seismicity Regions,"In regions of low-to-moderate seismicity where representative strong motion data is lacking, the modelling of seismic hazard relies on the use of seismological models. This paper presents a set of expressions that can be used as ground motion prediction equations that have been transformed from seismological models which resolve the generation of seismic waves into several components. The feature of this presented set of expressions is that it can be adapted to represent earthquake ground motion behaviour that is defined by a diversity of seismological models. The motivation behind the development of the presented adaptive predictive relationship which is known as theComponent Attenuation Model(CAM) was to fast track, and make transparent, the transformation from seismological models to predictions of response spectral values for engineering applications. Thus,CAMcan be used to waive away the need of executing any software for undertaking stochastic simulations nor time-history analyses for calculation of the response spectral ordinates. An important and original, the feature ofCAMis incorporating the shear wave velocity profile of the bedrock and the associated upper-crustal modification into the model. This article presentingCAMis essentially a contribution to engineering as opposed to seismology.

WoS,Resilient agri-food systems for nutrition amidst COVID-19: evidence and lessons from food-based approaches to overcome micronutrient deficiency and rebuild livelihoods after crises,"COVID-19 has had an instant effect on food systems in developing countries. Restrictions to the movement of people and goods have impaired access to markets, services and food. Unlike other concurrent crises, rather than threatening the material hardware of food systems, COVID-19 has so far affected the 'software' of food systems, highlighting again that connectivity is at the heart of these systems. Drops in demand, the loss of markets and employment and growing concerns about international cooperation are indications of possible deeper disruptions to come. Amidst this uncertainty, strategies to safeguard food and nutrition security of the world's poor need to prioritize diversification of production and markets. Nutritious, biofortified crops such as potato, sweetpotato, but also wheat, maize and beans among others, can play a more significant role to provide key micronutrients (vitamin A, iron, zinc) at large scale. Strong local market chains, robust smallholder production systems and increasing commercial utilization make these crops powerful vehicles for securing nutrition when markets and mobility look uncertain.

WoS,Design and Analysis of Hysteresis Feedback Controlled dc Power Supply for Solid State Power Amplifier,"Hysteresis feedback controlled synchronous buck converter-based power supply is designed and developed for biasing the transistors of Solid State RF Power Amplifier (SSPA). Design verification is done using PSIM software. The RF power requirement of SSPA varies from a few watts to 12 kW depending on RF application. It requires the power supply to have constant voltage and variable current. A comparative study of fixed frequency pulse width modulated (PWM) power converters and variable frequency hysteresis control power converter has been done. The advantages and challenges involved with hysteresis control are discussed. To operate SSPA, a 30-65 V, 320 A power supply is needed but to validate the power supply topology along with the controller, a prototype power supply developed with the same voltage rating and lower current rating of 10 AModular design is selected and operated with two parallel modules. The steady state and dynamic response are analyzed. Experimental and simulation results are in good agreement.",Buck converter; dc Power supply; Discontinuous conduction mode; Hysteresis control; Pulse width modulation; RF power amplifier,"Agarwal, R; Kumar, R; Suthar, G; Dalicha, H",2020.0,ReviewEA,IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH,10.1080/03772063.2020.1795935,"[Agarwal, Rohit; Kumar, Rajesh] Homi Bhabha Natl Inst, Mumbai 400094, Maharashtra, India; [Agarwal, Rohit; Kumar, Rajesh; Suthar, Gajendra; Dalicha, Hrushikesh] ITER India Inst Plasma Res, Gandhinagar 382428, Gujarat, India",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,English,0377-2063,
WoS,Electromagnetic (EM) catheter path tracking in ultrasound-guided brachytherapy of the breast,"Purpose To evaluate a novel navigation system for breast brachytherapy, based on ultrasound (US)-guided catheter needle implantations followed by electromagnetic (EM) tracking of catheter paths. Methods Breast phantoms were produced, containing US-visible tumors. Ultrasound was used to localize the tumor pose and volume within the phantom, followed by planning an optimal catheter pattern through the tumor using navigation software. An electromagnetic (EM)-tracked catheter needle was used to insert the catheters in the desired pattern. The inserted catheters were visualized on a post-implant CT, serving as ground truth. Electromagnetic (EM) tracking and reconstruction of the inserted catheter paths were performed by pulling a flexible EM guidewire through each catheter, performed in two clinical brachytherapy suites. The accuracy of EM catheter tracking was evaluated by calculating the Hausdorff distance between the EM-tracked and CT-based catheter paths. The accuracy and clinical feasibility of EM catheter tracking were also evaluated in three breast cancer patients, performed in a separate experiment room. Results A total of 71 catheter needles were implanted into 12 phantoms using US guidance and EM navigation, in an average +/- SD time of 8.1 +/- 2.9 min. The accuracy of EM catheter tracking was dependent on the brachytherapy suite: 2.0 +/- 1.2 mm in suite 1 and 0.6 +/- 0.2 mm in suite 2. EM catheter tracking was successfully performed in three breast brachytherapy patients. Catheter tracking typically took less than 5 min and had an average accuracy of 1.7 +/- 0.3 mm. Conclusion Our preliminary results show a potential role for US guidance and EM needle navigation for implantation of catheters for breast brachytherapy. EM catheter tracking can accurately assess the implant geometry in breast brachytherapy patients. This methodology has the potential to evaluate catheter positions directly after the implantation and during the several fractions of the treatment.",HDR breast brachytherapy; Electromagnetic tracking; Catheter tracking; Open-source,"Janssen, NNY; Brastianos, H; Akingbade, A; Olding, T; Vaughan, T; Ungi, T; Lasso, A; Joshi, C; Korzeniowski, M; Falkson, C; Fichtinger, G",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY,10.1007/s11548-020-02233-9,"[Janssen, Natasja N.

WoS,Accurate method for evaluating the duration of the entire radiotherapy process,"Background and purpose Along with the increasing demand for high-quality radiotherapy and the growing number of high-precision radiotherapy devices, precise radiotherapy workflow management and accurate time evaluation of the entire radiotherapy process are crucial to providing appropriate, timely treatment for cancer patients. This study therefore aimed to establish an accurate, reliable method for evaluating the duration of the radiotherapy process, from beginning to end, based on real-time measurement data. These data are vital for improving the quality and efficiency of radiotherapy delivery. Materials and methods Altogether, 17 620 cancer patients' radiotherapy experiences were measured in real time in our radiation oncology department. The process was divided into five sequential core modules, with the start and stop times of each module automatically recorded using MOSAIQ software, an automated radiotherapy management system. The duration for each module and the total duration of the entire process were then automatically calculated and qualitatively analyzed. Results The analysis showed significant treatment-time differences depending on the tumor site, which provided a practical reference for improvement of previous treatment modules and appointments management. In all, >60% of the cancer patients' total treatment time could be shortened. Conclusions We established a reliable method for evaluating the overall duration of radiotherapy protocols. The results pointed out a clear pathway by which we could improve future radiotherapy workflow management and appointment systems.",MOSAIQ; radiotherapy; time evaluation; workflow management,"Guo, CL; Huang, P; Li, YX; Dai, JR",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS,10.1002/acm2.12959,"[Guo, Chenlei; Huang, Peng; Li, Yexiong; Dai, Jianrong] Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Dept Radiat Oncol, Natl Canc Ctr, Natl Clin Res Ctr Canc,Canc Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China",WILEY,English,1526-9914,
WoS,Evaluation of a commercial deformable image registration algorithm for dual-energy CT processing,"Purpose Several dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) techniques require a deformable image registration to correct for motion between the acquisition of low and high energy data. However, current DECT software does not provide tools to assess registration accuracy or allow the user to export deformed images, presenting a unique challenge for image registration quality assurance (QA). This work presents a methodology to evaluate the accuracy of DECT deformable registration and to quantify the impact of registration errors on end-product images. Methods The deformable algorithm implemented in Siemen Healthineers's Syngo was evaluated using a deformable abdomen phantom and a rigid phantom to mimic sliding motion in the thorax. Both phantoms were imaged using sequential 80 and 140 kVp scans with motion applied between the two scans. Since Syngo does not allow the export of the deformed images, this study focused on quantifying the accuracy of various end-product, dual-energy images resulting from processing of deformed images. Results The Syngo algorithm performed well for the abdomen phantom with a mean registration error of 0.4 mm for landmark analysis, Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) > 0.90 for five organs contoured, and mean iodine concentrations within 0.2 mg/mL of values measured on static images. For rigid sliding motion, the algorithm performed poorer and resulted in noticeable registration errors toward the superior and inferior scan extents and DSCs as low as 0.41 for iodine rods imaged in the phantom. Additionally, local iodine concentration errors in areas of misregistration exceeded 3 mg/mL. Conclusions This work represents the first methodology for DECT image registration QA using commercial software. Our data support the clinical use of the Syngo algorithm for abdominal sites with limited motion (i.e., pancreas and liver). However, dual-energy images generated with this algorithm should be used with caution for quantitative measurements in areas with sliding motion.",deformable image registration; dual-energy CT; quality assurance; TG-132,"Huang, JY; Lawless, MJ; Matrosic, CK; Di Maso, LD; Miller, JR",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS,10.1002/acm2.12987,"[Huang, Jessie Y.; Lawless, Michael J.; Miller, Jessica R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Human Oncol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Huang, Jessie Y.; Matrosic, Charles K.; Di Maso, Lianna D.; Miller, Jessica R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Med Phys, Madison, WI 53706 USA",WILEY,English,1526-9914,

WoS,Pure magnesium laser surface modification using Nd:YAG laser,"Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are promising materials for a wide range of biomedical applications due to its biodegradability. Nevertheless, their rapid corrosion dictates the need to develop strategies to control these materials' corrosion rate. In fact, several surface modification techniques have been used to retard the corrosion of Mg and its alloys. Laser technology can be used to tailor Mg surfaces aiming to modify exposed area/roughness and thus control the biocorrosion process. This work presents a detailed study on pure Mg surface texturing by an Nd:YAG laser and their morphological characterisation, aiming to create either localised texturing or remelted areas. The characterisation of the textured and remelted surfaces was carried out by scanning electron microscopy and analysed using image analysis software (Image J) for obtaining their depth and width. Results show that higher scan speed (400 mm/s) and lower laser power (1.5 W) were unsuitable for machining pure Mg.

WoS,Fetal Weight Estimation Using Automated Fractional Limb Volume With2-DimensionalSize Parameters in Diabetic Pregnancies,"Objectives To examine the effect of adding automated fetal fractional limb volume (FLV) with conventional 2-dimensional (2D) fetal weight estimation procedures in a cohort of diabetic pregnancies. Methods A pilot study of diabetic pregnancies measured standard fetal biometry within 7 days of delivery. Fractional arm volume (AVol) and fractional thigh volume (TVol) soft tissue parameters were measured with a commercially available automated software utility (5D Limb Vol; Samsung Medison Co, Ltd, Seoul, Korea). Three conventional weight prediction models that included only 2D size parameters were compared to FLV models that included AVol or TVol. Estimated and actual birth weight (BW) were assessed for the mean percent difference +/- standard deviation of the percent differences. Systematic errors were evaluated by the Studentttest, and random errors were compared by the Pitman test for correlated variances. The proportion of neonates with estimated fetal weight within 10% of BW was compared between groups by the McNemar test. Results Ninety gravid women were enrolled with pregestational (26.7%) or gestational (73.3%) diabetes. All prediction models were accurate, with the exception of small underestimations by the model of Schild et al (-3.8%;Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol2004; 23:30-35). Random errors for the AVol (6.2%) and TVol (6.9%) models were significantly more precise than the other 3 prediction models: Hadlock et al (7.8%;Am J Obstet Gynecol1985; 151:333-337), INTERGROWTH-21st (8.0%;Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol2017; 49:478-486), and Schild et al (8.6%;P < .01). The greatest proportion of cases with BW +/- 10% was also classified by the AVol (91.1%) and TVol (91.1%) models, followed by Hadlock (83.3%), INTERGROWTH-21st (78.9%), and Schild (76.7%) predictions. Conclusions The addition of automated FLV measurements to conventional 2D biometry was associated with improved weight predictions in this cohort of diabetic pregnancies.",BW; fractional arm volume; fractional thigh volume; 3-dimensional ultrasound,"Lee, WS; Mack, LM; Gandhi, R; Sangi-Haghpeykar, H",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE,10.1002/jum.15397,"[Lee, Wesley; Mack, Lauren M.; Gandhi, Rajshi; Sangi-Haghpeykar, Haleh] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lee, Wesley; Mack, Lauren M.; Gandhi, Rajshi; Sangi-Haghpeykar, Haleh] Texas Childrens Pavil Women, Houston, TX USA",WILEY,English,0278-4297,
WoS,Experimental and numerical investigations on axial crushing of square cross-sections tube with vertical wave,"In this paper, wavy square absorbers were experimentally and numerically investigated. Numerical simulations were performed with LS-Dyna software on 36 wavy absorbers and their crushing properties were extracted and compared with the simple one. The effect of different parameters, including wave height, wave depth, and wave type; either internal or external on the crushing characteristics were also investigated. To experimentally create corrugation to validate the numerical results, a set of steel mandrel and matrix along with press machines were used. Since the initial specimens were brittle, they were subjected to heat treatment and annealing to gain the required ductility for forming with mandrel and matrix. The annealing of aluminum shells resulted in a 76%increase in ultimate strain and a 60% and 56% decrease in yield and ultimate stresses, respectively. The results showed that with increasing half-wave height in wavy square absorbers, the maximum force was first reduced and then increased. It was also found that in the specimen with constant diameter and half-wave depth, an increment in the half-wave height led to an initial increase in efficiency, followed by a decline. According to the conducted investigations, the lowe maximum force can be observed in the specimen with zero half-wave depth as compared to those having a depth of 1 cm.",axial compression; buckling; energy dissipation; quasi-static; numerical analysis,"Eyvazian, A; Eltai, E; Musharavati, F; Taghipoor, H; Sebaey, TA; Talebizadehsardari, P",2020.0,Journal,STEEL AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURES,10.12989/scs.2020.36.2.119,"[Eyvazian, Arameh; Eltai, Elsadig; Musharavati, Farayi] Qatar Univ, Mech & Ind Engn Dept, Coll Engn, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar; [Taghipoor, Hossein] Velayat Univ, Dept Mech Engn, POB 99111-31311, Iranshahr, Iran; [Sebaey, T.

WoS,Experimental and numerical evaluation of an innovative diamond-scheme bracing system equipped with a yielding damper,"Application of the steel ring as a type of seismic fuse has been one of the efforts made by researchers in recent years aiming to enhance the ductility of the bracing systems which in turn, possesses various advantages and disadvantages. Accordingly, to alleviate these disadvantages, an innovative bracing system with a diamond scheme equipped with a steel ring is introduced in this paper. In this system, the braces and yielding circular damper act in parallel whose main functionality is to increase ductility, energy absorption and mitigate drawbacks of the existing bracing systems, in which the braces and yielding circular damper act in parallel. To conduct the experimental tests, specimens with three types of rigid, semi-rigid and pinned connections were built and subjected to cyclic loading so that their performance could be analyzed. Promisingly, the results indicate both great applicability and efficiency of the proposed system in energy absorption and ductility. Moreover, it was concluded that as the braces and damper are in parallel, the use of a steel ring with smaller size and thickness would result in higher energy absorption and load-resisting capacity when compared to the other existing systems. Finally, to assess the potential of numerically modeling the proposed system, its finite element model was simulated by ABAQUS software and observed that there is a great agreement between the numerical and experimental results.",innovative bracing system; diamond-scheme brace; circular yielding damper; cyclic load; energy absorption; ductility,"Pachideh, G; Gholhaki, M; Kafi, M",2020.0,Journal,STEEL AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURES,10.12989/scs.2020.36.2.197,"[Pachideh, Ghasem; Gholhaki, Majid; Kafi, Mohammadali] Univ Semnan, Dept Civil Engn, Semnan, Iran",TECHNO-PRESS,English,1229-9367,
WoS,Numerical homogenization-based seismic assessment of an English-bond masonry prototype: Structural level application,"A multiscale strategy is evaluated at a structural level for the analysis of unreinforced masonry structures. The mechanical characterization of the masonry is deduced from homogenization-based micro-scale finite element (FE) models. The derived data are here employed at a structural level via a discrete FE model. The discrete FE model is composed of quadrilateral rigid plates interconnected through vertical and horizontal interfaces. On the interfaces, between adjoining discrete elements, a model that accounts for the in- and out-of-plane behavior of masonry, with damage and plasticity, is adopted. Such interfaces represent the material pre- and post-peak regimes, its orthotropy, and, depending on the micro-model assumed, account by three-dimensional shear effects that are especially important for multi-leaf walls and complex regular textures. The discrete model has been implemented in an advanced structural analysis software where powerful built-in features as the arc-length method, line-search algorithm, and implicit or explicit solver schemes are available. The multi-scale model is applied for the dynamic study of a small English-bond masonry house prototype subjected to a series of consecutive earthquake records. Detailed comparisons between the experimental and numerical data are presented, including the results obtained through a continuous total strain rotating crack model. Quasi-static and dynamic analyses are conducted. Results demonstrate that when enough experimental information is available on the masonry components under tension, shear, and compression regimes, the approach predicts well the seismic structural response in terms of time-history displacements, seismic capacity, and damage patterns.

WoS,Cluster computing-aided model updating for a high-fidelity finite element model of a long-span cable-stayed bridge,"Accurate and high-fidelity finite element (FE) models are in great demand in the design, performance assessment, and life-cycle maintenance of long-span cable-stayed bridges. The structural system of a long-span cable-stayed bridge is often huge in size and complex with many components connected and various materials constituted. Therefore, the FE model of a long-span cable-stayed bridge involves a large number of elements and nodes with many uncertainties. The model updating of the FE model to best represent a real bridge is necessary but very challenging. One of the challenging issues is that the numerical computation needed for searching the global optimum of a large set of structural parameters is so extensive that the existing FE (not surrogate) model-based updating methods cannot fulfill this task. In this study, a cluster computing-aided FE model updating framework is proposed for the high-performance FE model updating of large and complex structures. In the framework, several computer software packages, including MSC.Marc, Python, and MATLAB, are interconnected for making use of their respective functions of strength. The shake table test of a scaled physical structure of the Sutong cable-stayed bridge in China is used to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework. The simulated bridge responses based on the updated FE model are in good agreement with the measured ones from the shake table test. The successful application of the proposed framework provides a reference for the model updating of other types of large and complex structures.",cluster computing; finite element model updating; large and complex structures; long-span cable-stayed bridge; shake table test,"Lin, KQ; Xu, YL; Lu, XZ; Guan, ZG; Li, JZ",2020.0,Journal,EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS,10.1002/eqe.3270,"[Lin, Kaiqi] Fuzhou Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Lin, Kaiqi; Xu, You-Lin] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xinzheng] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Key Lab Civil Engn Safety & Durabil, China Educ Minist, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guan, Zhongguo; Li, Jianzhong] Tongji Univ, Dept Bridge Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",WILEY,English,0098-8847,
WoS,Numerical study of extreme mechanical force exerted by a turbulent flow on a bluff body by direct and rare-event sampling techniques,"This study investigates, by means of numerical simulations, extreme mechanical force exerted by a turbulent flow impinging on a bluff body, and examines the relevance of two distinct rare-event algorithms to efficiently sample these events. The drag experienced by a square obstacle placed in a turbulent channel flow (in two dimensions) is taken as a representative case study. Direct sampling shows that extreme fluctuations are closely related to the presence of a strong vortex blocked in the near wake of the obstacle. This vortex is responsible for a significant pressure drop between the forebody and the base of the obstacle, thus yielding a very high value of the drag. Two algorithms are then considered to speed up the sampling of such flow scenarios, namely the adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) and the Giardina-Kurchan-Tailleur-Lecomte (GKTL) algorithms. The general idea behind these algorithms is to replace a long simulation by a set of much shorter ones, running in parallel, with dynamics that is replicated or pruned, according to some specific rules designed to sample large-amplitude events more frequently. These algorithms have been shown to be relevant for a wide range of problems in statistical physics, computer science, biochemistry. The present study is the first application to a fluid-structure interaction problem. Practical evidence is given that the fast sweeping time of turbulent fluid structures past the obstacle has a strong influence on the efficiency of the rare-event algorithm. While the AMS algorithm does not yield significant run-time savings as compared to direct sampling, the GKTL algorithm appears to be effective in sampling very efficiently extreme fluctuations of the time-averaged drag and estimating related statistics such as return times.

WoS,SPAligner: alignment of long diverged molecular sequences to assembly graphs,"Background Graph-based representation of genome assemblies has been recently used in different contexts - from improved reconstruction of plasmid sequences and refined analysis of metagenomic data to read error correction and reference-free haplotype reconstruction. While many of these applications heavily utilize the alignment of long nucleotide sequences to assembly graphs, first general-purpose software tools for finding such alignments have been released only recently and their deficiencies and limitations are yet to be discovered. Moreover, existing tools can not perform alignment of amino acid sequences, which could prove useful in various contexts - in particular the analysis of metagenomic sequencing data. Results In this work we present a novel SPAligner (Saint-Petersburg Aligner) tool for aligning long diverged nucleotide and amino acid sequences to assembly graphs. We demonstrate that SPAligner is an efficient solution for mapping third generation sequencing reads onto assembly graphs of various complexity and also show how it can facilitate the identification of known genes in complex metagenomic datasets.

WoS,imputeqc: an R package for assessing imputation quality of genotypes and optimizing imputation parameters,"Background: The imputation of genotypes increases the power of genome-wide association studies. However, the imputation quality should be assessed in each particular case. Nevertheless, not all imputation softwares control the error of output, e.g., the last release of fastPHASE program (1.4.8) lacks such an option. In this particular software there is also an uncertainty in choosing the model parameters. fastPHASE is based on haplotype clusters, which size should be set a priori. The parameter influences the results of imputation and downstream analysis. Results: We present a software toolkitimputeqcto assess the imputation quality and/or to choose the model parameters for imputation.

The discordance of genotypes received correlated well in both methods. Usingimputeqc, we also shown how to choose the optimal number of haplotype clusters and expectation-maximization cycles for fastPHASE program. The found number of haplotype clusters of 25 was further applied for hapFLK testing that revealed signatures of selection at LCT region on chromosome 2.

WoS,Extending rnaSPAdes functionality for hybrid transcriptome assembly,"Background De novo RNA-Seq assembly is a powerful method for analysing transcriptomes when the reference genome is not available or poorly annotated. However, due to the short length of Illumina reads it is usually impossible to reconstruct complete sequences of complex genes and alternative isoforms. Recently emerged possibility to generate long RNA reads, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopores, may dramatically improve the assembly quality, and thus the consecutive analysis. While reference-based tools for analysing long RNA reads were recently developed, there is no established pipeline for de novo assembly of such data. Results In this work we present a novel method that allows to perform high-quality de novo transcriptome assemblies by combining accuracy and reliability of short reads with exon structure information carried out from long error-prone reads. The algorithm is designed by incorporating existing hybridSPAdes approach into rnaSPAdes pipeline and adapting it for transcriptomic data. Conclusion To evaluate the benefit of using long RNA reads we selected several datasets containing both Illumina and Iso-seq or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) reads. Using an existing quality assessment software, we show that hybrid assemblies performed with rnaSPAdes contain more full-length genes and alternative isoforms comparing to the case when only short-read data is used.",Transcriptome assembly; Hybrid assembly; De novo assembly; Transcriptomics; RNA-Seq; Iso-seq; Oxford nanopores,"Prjibelski, AD; Puglia, GD; Antipov, D; Bushmanova, E; Giordano, D; Mikheenko, A; Vitale, D; Lapidus, A",2020.0,Conference,3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics - From Algorithms to Applications (BiATA),10.1186/s12859-020-03614-2,"[Prjibelski, Andrey D.; Antipov, Dmitry; Bushmanova, Elena; Mikheenko, Alla; Lapidus, Alla] St Petersburg State Univ, Ctr Algorithm Biotechnol, Inst Translat Biomed, St Petersburg, Russia; [Puglia, Giuseppe D.; Vitale, Domenico] CNR, Ist & Sistemi Agr & Forestali Mediterraneo Catani, Catania, Italy; [Giordano, Daniela] Univ Catania, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Catania, Italy",BMC,English,1471-2105,
WoS,Three-dimensional CFD simulation and experimental validation of particle segregation in CFB riser,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to perform the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation with experimental validation to investigate the particle segregation effect in abrupt and smooth shapes circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers. Design/methodology/approach The experimental investigations were carried out in lab-scale CFB systems and the CFD simulations were performed by using commercial software BARRACUDA. Special attention was paid to investigate the gas-particle flow behavior at the top of the riser with three different superficial velocities, namely, 4, 6 and 7.7 m/s. Here, a CFD-based noble simulation approach called multi-phase particle in cell (MP-PIC) was used to investigate the effect of traditional drag models (Wen-Yu, Ergun, Wen-Yu-Ergun and Richardson-Davidson-Harrison) on particle flow characteristics in CFB riser. Findings Findings from the experimentations revealed that the increase in gas velocity leads to decrease the mixing index inside the riser. Moreover, the solid holdup found more in abrupt riser than smooth riser at the constant gas velocity. Despite the more experimental investigations, the findings with CFD simulations revealed that the MP-PIC approach, which was combined with different drag models could be more effective for the practical (industrial) design of CFB riser. Well agreement was found between the simulation and experimental outputs. The simulation work was compared with experimental data, which shows the good agreement (<4%). Originality/value The experimental and simulation study performed in this research study constitutes an easy-to-use with different drag coefficient. The proposed MP-PIC model is more effective for large particles fluidized bed, which can be helpful for further research on industrial gas-particle fluidized bed reactors.

WoS,Phenylketonuria screening in Iranian newborns: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Phenylketonuria (PKU), which is characterized by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, is an autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism. Newborn screening is the main population-based public health screening program that allows successful identification and treatment of PKU with low-Phe diet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of PKU screening in Iranian newborns. Methods The present study was designed based on MOOSE protocol and reporting was done in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol of this systematic review was published in PROSPERO before it was performed (CRD42020162626). A comprehensive search was done in 10/10/2019 to find related literature on international online databases Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Science Direct, PubMed/Medline, EBSCO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, national online databases and the Google Scholar search engine. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I(2)index and Q test. All meta-analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software ver. 2.P < 0.05 was considered significant. Result Finally, 18 studies with 3,339,327 Iranian neonates were included. The prevalence of suspected hyperphenylalaninemia(HPA) was estimated to be 45.6/100,000 (95% CI: 23.9-87.1). The prevalence of suspected HPA in girls and boys infants in Iran was estimated to be 38.0/100,000 (95% CI: 15.1-95.5) and 43.3/100,000 (95% CI: 16.2-116.2), respectively. The prevalence of PKU was estimated to be 16.5/100,000 (95% CI: 12.9-21.2). The prevalence of PKU in girls and boys infants was estimated to be 13.3/100,000 (95% CI: 7.5-15.8) and 10.9/100,000 (95% CI: 7.5-15.8), respectively. The prevalence of mild to moderate HPA was estimated 9.7/100,000 (95% CI: 5.1-18.4) and the prevalence of classical PKU was estimated 4.4/100,000 (95% CI: 2.5-7.8). Sensitivity analysis for all meta-analysis with the omission of one study showed that overall estimation is still robust. Conclusion The results of this meta-analysis showed that PKU is prevalent in Iranian neonates.It should be considered that for PKU there is a highly effective dietary treatment which can prevent the clinical symptoms of PKU if initiated early after detection by newborn screening.",Phenylketonuria; Iran; Newborn; Meta-analysis,"Shokri, M; Karimi, P; Zamanifar, H; Kazemi, F; Badfar, G; Azami, M",2020.0,Review,BMC PEDIATRICS,10.1186/s12887-020-02230-6,"[Shokri, Mehdi; Karimi, Parviz] Ilam Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Ilam, Iran; [Zamanifar, Hadis] Ahvaz Jundishapour Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Ahwaz, Iran; [Kazemi, Fatemeh] Qazvin Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Qazvin, Iran; [Badfar, Gholamreza] Ahvaz Jundishapour Univ Med Sci, Fac Med, Dept Pediat, Ahwaz, Iran; [Azami, Milad] Ilam Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Ilam, Iran",BMC,English,,

Heat and mass transfer under the influence of magnetic dipole over a stretching sheet are taken into account. Design/methodology/approach Nonlinear coupled governing equations are solved using the optimal homotopy asymptotic technique, and a computer software package BVPh 2.0 is used for numerical computations.

It is seen that the heat transfer deceases for higher values of viscous dissipation parameter, radiation parameter, Dufour number, whereas it increases for bigger values of Prandtl number. The numerical results have been validated through comparison with existing literature as a special case of proposed model and perceived that the Soret number has reining role to increase the rate of heat transfer.

WoS,REMoDNaV: robust eye-movement classification for dynamic stimulation,"Tracking of eye movements is an established measurement for many types of experimental paradigms. More complex and more prolonged visual stimuli have made algorithmic approaches to eye-movement event classification the most pragmatic option. A recent analysis revealed that many current algorithms are lackluster when it comes to data from viewing dynamic stimuli such as video sequences. Here we present an event classification algorithm-built on an existing velocity-based approach-that is suitable for both static and dynamic stimulation, and is capable of classifying saccades, post-saccadic oscillations, fixations, and smooth pursuit events. We validated classification performance and robustness on three public datasets: 1) manually annotated, trial-based gaze trajectories for viewing static images, moving dots, and short video sequences, 2) lab-quality gaze recordings for a feature-length movie, and 3) gaze recordings acquired under suboptimal lighting conditions inside the bore of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner for the same full-length movie. We found that the proposed algorithm performs on par or better compared to state-of-the-art alternatives for static stimulation. Moreover, it yields eye-movement events with biologically plausible characteristics on prolonged dynamic recordings. Lastly, algorithm performance is robust on data acquired under suboptimal conditions that exhibit a temporally varying noise level. These results indicate that the proposed algorithm is a robust tool with improved classification accuracy across a range of use cases. The algorithm is cross-platform compatible, implemented using the Python programming language, and readily available as free and open-source software from public sources.",Eye tracking; Adaptive classification algorithm; Saccade classification algorithm; Statistical saccade analysis; Glissade classification; Adaptive threshold algorithm; Data preprocessing,"Dar, AH; Wagner, AS; Hanke, M",2020.0,JournalEA,BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS,10.3758/s13428-020-01428-x,"[Dar, Asim H.] Leibniz Inst Neurobiol, Special Lab Noninvas Brain Imaging, Brenneckestr 6, Magdeburg, Germany; [Wagner, Adina S.; Hanke, Michael] Res Ctr Julich, Inst Neurosci & Med INM 7 Brain & Behav, Psychoinformat Lab, Julich, Germany; [Hanke, Michael] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Syst Neurosci, Med Fac, Dusseldorf, Germany",SPRINGER,English,1554-351X,
WoS,Design and development of the online career counselling: a tool for better career decision-making,"Nowadays, students experience career problems, such as the transition from university to the labour market where they need the career counselling services. Accordingly, it was attempted to design an online career counselling tool and provide services and guidance for students in career fields. This study was conducted in three parts in 2019. In the first part, the career counselling website was designed. In the second part, using the opinions of the experts (20 career counselling experts and 20 software engineering specialists), the website efficiency was assessed, and, in the third part, to conduct the online career counselling, 45 students were assigned into the online counselling, the face-to-face groups, and the control groups to compare their career decision-makings at the pretest and the post-test. The results showed that it is possible to design the online career counselling. Also, according to the results of the third part, the face-to-face and the online groups, compared with the control group, showed a significant and positive mean in the career decision-making.

WoS,Individuals with the post-traumatic stress disorder process emotions in subcortical regions irrespective of cognitive engagement: a meta-analysis of cognitive and emotional interface,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) manifests as emotional suffering and problem-solving impairments under extreme stress. This meta-analysis aimed to pool the findings from all the studies examining emotion and cognition in individuals with PTSD to develop a robust mechanistic understanding of the related brain dysfunction. We identified primary studies through a comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases. The GingerALE software (version 2.3.6) from the BrainMap Project was used to conduct activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses of the eligible studies for cognition, emotion and interface of both. Relative to the non-clinical (NC) group, the PTSD group showed greater activation during emotional tasks in the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. In contrast, the NC group showed significantly greater activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) than did the PTSD group in the emotional tasks. When both emotional and cognitive processing were evaluated, the PTSD group showed significantly greater activation in the striatum than did the NC group. No differences in activation between the PTSD and NC groups were noted when only the cognitive systems were examined. Individuals with PTSD exhibited overactivity in the subcortical regions, i.e., amygdala and striatum, when processing emotions. Underactivity in the emotional and cognitive processing intermediary cortex, i.e., the ACC, was especially prominent in individuals with PTSD relative to the NC population following exposure to emotional stimuli. These findings may explain the trauma-related fear, irritability, and negative effects as well as the concentration difficulties during cognitive distress associated with emotional arousal, that are commonly observed in individuals with PTSD.",Post-traumatic stress disorder; Meta-analysis; Amygdala; fMRI; Affect; Emotion,"Lee, MS; Anumagalla, P; Pavuluri, MN",2020.0,JournalEA,BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR,10.1007/s11682-020-00303-9,"[Lee, Moon-Soo; Anumagalla, Purnima; Pavuluri, Mani N.] Brain & Wellness Inst, Dept Adult Adolescent & Child Psychiat, 1500 N Halsted St, Chicago, IL 60642 USA; [Lee, Moon-Soo] Korea Univ, Guro Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Seoul 08308, South Korea",SPRINGER,English,1931-7557,
WoS,Decreased cortical thickness of left premotor cortex as a treatment predictor in major depressive disorder,"This study aimed to examine the cerebral cortex characteristics (thickness, surface area, and curvature) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and explore whether these cortex characteristics are predictors for the antidepressant therapeutic effect. 105 patients with MDD and 49 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Both groups were given magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans at baseline period, and then the cerebral cortex characteristics (thickness, surface area, and curvature) were calculated using the DPABISurf software. The Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24) reductive rate was used to measure antidepressant therapeutic effect and Snaith Hamilton Rating Scale (SHAPS) reduction was performed to assess the change of anhedonia after treatment of 8 weeks. Correlation analysis was performed to identify the relationship between cortex characteristics and antidepressant therapeutic effect in patients with MDD. There were no significant differences in the cortical curvature and surface area between MDD and HC groups, while significant decreases were found in the cortical thickness of inferior frontal cortex (IFC), premotor cortex (PMC), orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) in the left hemisphere of MDD group, comparing with HC group (P < 0.05 for all, corrected by threshold-free cluster enhancement). In MDD group, the cortical thickness of left PMC had significant positive correlations with 8-week HAMD-24 reduction (r = 0.228,P = 0.020) and HAMD-24 reductive rate (r = 0.193,P = 0.048); and a negative correlation with the 8-week SHAPS reduction (r = -0.240,P = 0.018). Decreased cortical thickness in left PMC may be a predictor of therapeutic effect in MDD.

WoS,Predicting the Compressive Stress-Strain Curve of FRP-Confined Concrete Column Considering the Variation of Poisson's Ratio,"As it is well known, Poisson's ratio of concrete is not constant during a loading process, but increases with increasing compressive loading. In this study, the effect of Poisson's ratio and its variation on the compressive behavior of FRP-confined concrete is investigated using finite element (FE) analysis. The concrete triaxial behavior was modeled using plasticity theory and damage mechanics. Buckling of longitudinal rebars and bending of transverse rebars were included in the model. Because of the software limitations for applying the variation of Poisson's ratio during the loading process, a stepwise procedure is proposed. For the sake of verification and corroboration of the results, for column samples under different confining and reinforcing conditions, the available test data in literature were examined. The data set contains 25 FRP-confined normal strength concrete columns with different number of FRP layers with or without steel reinforcement. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of considering the variation of Poisson's ratio in 3D finite element analysis of confined concrete. Comparing the results obtained from the proposed model with the available test results in the literature shows that the average absolute error (AAE) of the proposed model is less than 14% with standard deviation (SD) of 6.16%. Therefore, the capability of this model in estimation of the entire compressive stress-strain curve of concrete columns over a wide range of confining conditions is acceptable.",Normal strength concrete; Finite element; Confinement; Poisson's ratio; FRP; Plasticity,"Rasouli, M; Broujerdian, V; Kazemnadi, A",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,10.1007/s40999-020-00550-3,"[Rasouli, Mohammad; Broujerdian, Vahid; Kazemnadi, Ali] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn, POB 16765-163, Tehran, Iran",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,English,1735-0522,
WoS,Control of deposition height in WAAM using visual inspection of previous and current layers,"Wire plus arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has been demonstrated to be a powerful technique to produce large-scale metal parts with low cost. However, techniques to achieve accurate geometry control and high process stability have not yet been perfectly developed. Although implementing vision sensing and closed-loop control can contribute to promoting the levels of process automation and stability, it is difficult to markedly improve the geometry precision of parts by only performing the current layer detection due to a large detection lag with vision-based sensors. To deal with this issue, this study proposes a novel strategy of introducing the previous layer information into the current deposition height to increase the response speed of the control system. The previous and current layer heights are monitored by a passive vision sensor. The height features are extracted by image processing algorithms mainly including edge detection, threshold division, and line fitting. Deviations in deposition height are automatically compensated via controlling the wire feed speed based on a PID controller. A helpful software interface is implemented in the Visual C++ environment to study the automatic detection and control system. In comparison to the closed-loop control using only the current layer detection, the deposition height of thin-walled parts can be excellently controlled by the proposed control system using the visual inspection of previous and current layers, significantly increasing the process stability and achieving accurate height control in WAAM.",Wire plus arc additive manufacturing; Automatic control; Visual sensing; Previous and current layers,"Xiong, J; Zhang, YY; Pi, YP",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING,10.1007/s10845-020-01634-6,"[Xiong, Jun; Zhang, Yiyang; Pi, Yupeng] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Key Lab Adv Technol Mat, Minist Educ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 111,Sect 1 North Second Ring Rd, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,0956-5515,

While prediction is useful, after prediction comesplanningabout what actions to take in order to improve quality. This research seeks methods that generate demonstrably useful guidance on what to do within the context of a specific software project. Specifically, we propose XTREE (for within-project planning) and BELLTREE (for cross-project planning) to generating plans that can improve software quality. Each such plan has the property that, if followed, it reduces the expected number of future defect reports. To find this expected number, planning was first applied to data from releasex. Next, we looked for change in releasex+ 1 that conformed to our plans. This procedure was applied using a range of planners from the literature, as well as XTREE. In 10 open-source JAVA systems, several hundreds of defects were reduced in sections of the code that conformed to XTREE's plans. Further, when compared to other planners, XTREE's plans were found to be easier to implement (since they were shorter) and more effective at reducing the expected number of defects.",Data mining; Actionable analytics; Planning; Bellwethers; Defect prediction,"Krishna, R; Menzies, T",2020.0,JournalEA,EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,10.1007/s10664-020-09843-6,"[Krishna, Rahul] Columbia Univ, Comp Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Menzies, Tim] NC State Univ, Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC USA",SPRINGER,English,1382-3256,

This increment in operating parameters tends to limit the useful life of these pipes. Thus, high creep resistant materials such as X20 CrMoV12-1 and P91 (9Cr-1Mo) are used to manufacture steam pipes. In this paper, the creep behaviour of X20 CrMoV12-1 and P91 (9Cr-1Mo) steam piping network subjected to typical operating condition was determined via a finite element analysis code, Abaqus CAE/2017 alongside fe-safe/Turbolife software, and their results were compared. The maximum creep stress, strain rate, creep damage and worst creep life in both piping materials were developed on the intrados of the elbow, with P91 steam pipe having higher useful creep life.

Ligand-receptor interactions were derived from the best position (best pose) of studied compounds, as ligands, in the active site of receptors using Autodock 4.2 software and named as molecular docking descriptors. The drug-like indexes were calculated using DRAGON 5.5 software. Two groups of descriptors were mixed, and the stepwise regression method was used for the selection of the most relevant descriptors. Four selected descriptors were subsequently used to construct the quantitative structure-activity relationship model using the Levenberg-Marquardt artificial neural network method. Dataset was randomly divided into the train (53 compounds), validation (10 compounds) and test set (10 compounds). The best model was selected according to the lowest mean square error value of the validation set.

WoS,Surgery 4.0-are we ready?,"The increasing networking of data systems in medicine is not only leading to modern interdisciplinarity in the sense of cooperation between different medical departments, but also poses new challenges regarding the building and room infrastructure. The surgical operating room of the future expands or augments its reality, away from the pure building characteristics, towards an intelligent and communicative space platform. The building infrastructure (operating theatre) serves as sensor and actuator. Thus, it is possible to inform about missing diagnostics as well as to register them directly in the contextualization of the planned surgical intervention or to integrate them into the processes. Integrated operating theatres represent a comprehensive computer platform based on a corresponding system architecture with software-based protocols. An underlying modular system consisting of various modules for image acquisition and analysis, interaction and visualization supports the integration and merging of heterogeneous data that are generated in a hospital operation. Integral building data (e.g., air conditioning, lighting control, device registration) are merged with patient-related data (age, type of illness, concomitant diseases, existing diagnostic CT and MRI images). New systems coming onto the market, as well as already existing systems will have to be measured by the extent to which they will be able to guarantee this integration of information-similar to the development from mobile phone to smartphone.

To develop an understanding of technology integration in classrooms, this research focused on the use of dynamic geometry by a mathematics teacher who was a novice in technology-use, in the context of Turkish secondary school mathematics. Professional instrumental genesis and hiccup constructs were chosen as theoretical constructs for the study. Following these constructs, the classroom practices of the teacher were analysed to shed light on the character of the professional instrumentation and the process through which it developed, by highlighting the lesson hiccups. This case study analysis illustrated a number of potential problems and ways in which the teacher adapted her classroom practices, and provided some indications of the growth of teaching schemes in the course of appropriating dynamic geometry.",Classroom teaching; Dynamic geometry; Instrumental genesis; Professional instrumentation; Lesson hiccups,"Bozkurt, G; Uygan, C",2020.0,JournalEA,ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION,10.1007/s11858-020-01184-4,"[Bozkurt, Gulay; Uygan, Candas] Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Fac Educ, Eskisehir, Turkey",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1863-9690,

WoS,Factors Related to Internet Adoption and Its Use to Seek Health Information in Mexico,"The Internet has the potential to be a valuable resource for the dissemination of health promotion information to the general population, mainly in conditions with well-developed health and digital literacy. Few studies have been undertaken on the adoption of the Internet by the Mexican population and its use to seek health information. The aim of this paper was to identify the factors that determine Internet adoption and its use by the heads of Mexican households for obtaining health information. This study used data taken from a probabilistic and cross-sectional national survey (National Survey on the Availability and Use of Information Technologies in Households, or ENDUTIH), applying an economic approach based on utility maximization theory. We estimated a univariate probit model for Internet adoption and a consecutive bivariate probit model with sample selection for the use of the Internet to seek health information. The software package was used to adjust and estimate the proposed models. The first model (Internet adoption) identified several factors related to digital divides in the country, while the second (Internet use to seek health information) identified various factors influencing online searches for health information, such as the following: being a woman; being an adult; having a higher level of education; having a higher income; having superior digital skills; and, living in an urban area.

WoS,The effect of process tailoring on software project performance: The role of team absorptive capacity and its knowledge-based enablers,"Software process tailoring (SPT) is a team-based and learning-intensive activity that addresses the particular dynamic characteristics of a development project. Because SPT critically influences how projects are conducted, its performance should be investigated. However, the extant literature lacks empirical evidence on how the underlying effects of SPT performance and its team-supportive factors operate and influence software project performance. From the knowledge perspective, this study adopts dynamic capabilities theory and considers the learning ability and absorptive capacity of software project teams to develop a theoretical model to address this gap. The results of an empirical examination of the model with 135 software project teams advance our understanding of how team-level learning antecedents-experience, communication quality and trust-dynamically facilitate teams' absorptive capacity (AC) when they conduct SPT, which in turn reinforces project performance. The mediating effects of the proposed model are unveiled and discussed, and theoretical implications as well as practical guidance for how AC and these factors promote SPT and project performance are suggested.",absorptive capacity; dynamic capabilities; learning antecedents; software process tailoring; software project performance,"Lee, JC; Chou, IC; Chen, CY",2020.0,JournalEA,INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL,10.1111/isj.12303,"[Lee, Jung-Chieh] Beijing Normal Univ Zhuhai, Int Business Fac, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Chou, I-Chia; Chen, Chung-Yang] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Informat Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan",WILEY,English,1350-1917,

With an unobstructed line-of-sight visibility of approximately 3 min, a typical LEO satellite requires efficient user terminal (UT), satellite, gateway, and intersatellite link handovers. A comprehensive mobility design for mega-constellations involves cost-effective space and ground phased-array antennas for responsive and seamless tracking. An end-to-end multilayer protocol architecture spanning space and terrestrial technologies can be used to analyze and ensure QoS and mobility. A scalable routing and traffic engineering design based on software-defined networking adequately handles continuous variability in network topology, differentiated user demands, and traffic transport in both temporal and spatial dimensions.

WoS,Three-dimensional structure of seminiferous tubules in the Syrian hamster,"The hamster is useful for the study of male reproductive biology. However, unlike in the mouse and rat, the gross structure of seminiferous tubules in the hamster is largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to clarify the precise 3-dimensional (3D) structure of seminiferous tubules in hamsters. We reconstructed all seminiferous tubules in 3 and 1 testes from 0-day (P0) and 10-week (adult) Syrian hamsters, respectively, using serial paraffin sections and high-performance 3D reconstruction software. In P0 hamsters, the average numbers of seminiferous tubules, terminating points, branching points, and blind ends per testis were 9.0, 89.7, 93.0, and 0.7, respectively. There were two types of tubules: shorter and dominant ones. The dominant tubules, 2-4 in number per testis and accounting for 86% of the total tubule length, had many terminating and branching points and appeared to be derived from the anastomosis of many shorter tubules. In an adult hamster, there were 11 seminiferous tubules with a total length of 22 m, 98 terminating points, 88 branching points, and 2 blind ends per testis. Three of the 11 tubules were dominant ones, accounting for 83% of the total length, and occupied the testis from the surface over the circumference to the center, while the others were short and occupied only one side of the testis. The amplitude and direction of the curves of tubules were random, and there were no funnel-shaped networks of tubules present, in contrast to the mouse testis.

WoS,Producing 3D printed high-fidelity retroperitoneal models from in vivo patient data: The Oxford Method,"Macroscopic anatomy has traditionally been taught using cadaveric material, lectures and a variable amount of additional resources such as online modules. Anatomical models have also been used to assist in teaching. Of these, traditional plastic models have been shown to be effective educational tools, yet have significant drawbacks such as a lack of anatomical detail and texturisation. Three-dimensional (3D) printed models stand to solve these problems and widen access to high-quality anatomical teaching. This paper outlines the use of 3D multi-planar imaging (CT and MRI) as a framework to develop an accurate model of the retroperitoneum. CT and MRI scans were used to construct a virtual 3D model of the retroperitoneum. This was printed locally as a full-size colour model for use in medical education. We give a complete account of the processes and software used. This study is amongst the first of a series in which we will document the newly formedOxford Library of Anatomy. This series will provide the methodology for the production of models from CT and MRI scans, and the Oxford Library of Anatomy will provide a complete series of some of the most complex anatomical areas and ones which degrade quickly when a real cadaver is being used. In our own internal experience, the models are highly accurate, reproducible and durable, as compared to prosected specimens.

WoS,Surgery scheduling heuristic considering OR downstream and upstream facilities and resources,"BackgroundSurgical theater (ST) operations planning is a key subject in the healthcare management literature, particularly the scheduling of procedures in operating rooms (ORs). The OR scheduling problem is usually approached using mathematical modeling and made available to ST managers through dedicated software. Regardless of the large body of knowledge on the subject, OR scheduling models rarely consider the integration of OR downstream and upstream facilities and resources or validate their propositions in real life, rather using simulated scenarios. We propose a heuristic to sequence surgeries that considers both upstream and downstream resources required to perform them, such as surgical kits, post anesthesia care unit (PACU) beds, and surgical teams (surgeons, nurses and anesthetists).MethodsUsing hybrid flow shop (HFS) techniques and the break-in-moment (BIM) concept, the goal is to find a sequence that maximizes the number of procedures assigned to the ORs while minimizing the variance of intervals between surgeries' completions, smoothing the demand for downstream resources such as PACU beds and OR sanitizing teams. There are five steps to the proposed heuristic: listing of priorities, local scheduling, global scheduling, feasibility check and identification of best scheduling.ResultsOur propositions were validated in a high complexity tertiary University hospital in two ways: first, applying the heuristic to historical data from five typical ST days and comparing the performance of our proposed sequences to the ones actually implemented; second, pilot testing the heuristic during ten days in the ORs, allowing a full rotation of surgical specialties. Results displayed an average increase of 37.2% in OR occupancy, allowing an average increase of 4.5 in the number of surgeries performed daily, and reducing the variance of intervals between surgeries' completions by 55.5%. A more uniform distribution of patients' arrivals at the PACU was also observed.ConclusionsOur proposed heuristic is particularly useful to plan the operation of STs in which resources are constrained, a situation that is common in hospital from developing countries. Our propositions were validated through a pilot implementation in a large hospital, contributing to the scarce literature on actual OR scheduling implementation.",Surgery scheduling; OR sequencing; Break-in-moment; Surgical theater management; Operating room,"Calegari, R; Fogliatto, FS; Lucini, FR; Anzanello, MJ; Schaan, BD",2020.0,Journal,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,10.1186/s12913-020-05555-1,"[Calegari, Rafael; Fogliatto, Flavio S.; Anzanello, Michel J.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ind Engn, Ave Osvaldo Aranha 99,5 Andar, BR-90035190 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Lucini, Filipe R.] Univ Calgary, Dept Crit Care Med, Cumming Sch Med, 3330 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Schaan, Beatriz D.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Div Endocrinol, Hosp Clin Porto Alegre, Ave Ramiro Barcelos 2350,4 Andar, BR-90035903 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",BMC,English,,
WoS,The DNNLikelihood: enhancing likelihood distribution with Deep Learning,"We introduce the DNNLikelihood, a novel framework to easily encode, through deep neural networks (DNN), the full experimental information contained in complicated likelihood functions (LFs). We show how to efficiently parametrise the LF, treated as a multivariate function of parameters of interest and nuisance parameters with high dimensionality, as an interpolating function in the form of a DNN predictor. We do not use any Gaussian approximation or dimensionality reduction, such as marginalisation or profiling over nuisance parameters, so that the full experimental information is retained. The procedure applies to both binned and unbinned LFs, and allows for an efficient distribution to multiple software platforms, e.g. through the framework-independent ONNX model format. The distributed DNNLikelihood can be used for different use cases, such as re-sampling through Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, possibly with custom priors, combination with other LFs, when the correlations among parameters are known, and re-interpretation within different statistical approaches, i.e. Bayesian vs frequentist. We discuss the accuracy of our proposal and its relations with other approximation techniques and likelihood distribution frameworks.

WoS,"SHiNeMaS: a web tool dedicated to seed lots history, phenotyping and cultural practices","Motivation In 2005, researchers from the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (Institut national de recherche pour l'agriculture, l'alimentation et l'environnement, INRAE) started a collaboration with the French farmers' seed network Reseau Semences Paysannes (RSP) on bread wheat participatory breeding (PPB). The aims were: (1) to study on-farm management of crop diversity, (2) to develop population-varieties adapted to organic and low-inputs agriculture, (3) to co-develop tools and methods adapted to on-farm experiments. In this project, researchers and farmers' organizations needed to map the history and life cycle of the population-varieties using network formalism to represent relationships between seed lots. All this information had to be centralized and stored in a database. Results We describe here SHiNeMaS (Seeds History and Network Management System) a web tool database. SHiNeMaS aims to provide useful interfaces to track seed lot history and related data (phenotyping, environment, cultural practices). Although SHiNeMaS has been developed in the context of a bread wheat participatory breeding program, the database has been designed to manage any kind and even multiple cultivated plant species. SHiNeMaS is available under Affero GPL licence and uses free technologies such as the Python language, Django framework or PostgreSQL database management system (DBMS). Conclusion We developed SHiNeMaS, a web tool database, dedicated to the management of the history of seed lots and related data like phenotyping, environmental information and cultural practices.

They are monoecious, with a mixed reproductive system, and high ecological and economic importance. There is controversy regarding the taxonomic status ofAcrocomia aculeataandAcrocomia totaias different species; to avoid misunderstanding, we adopted the ecotype terminology. Using range-wide sampling in Brazil and based on microsatellite data, we aimed to understand the genetic diversity ofA. aculeataandA. totaiand to evaluate if the genetic structure between them was different. Our results support a separation ofAcrocomia aculeataandA. totaibased on the patterns of genetic variation between the ecotypes. These findings are supported by the optimal clustering ofK = 7, congruent with network analysis, as well as pairwise genetic differentiation and detected barriers to gene flow. We found no evidence of recent bottlenecks in all populations, excepting two. The genetic structure was mainly associated with rivers and topography, but there was also evidence of gene flow among most populations. The association of the genetic structure with the geographical distribution of populations was more evident inA. aculeatathan inA. totai.

WoS,Ice crystal characterization in cirrus clouds II: radiometric characterization of HaloCam for the quantitative analysis of halo displays,"We present a procedure for geometric, spectral, and absolute radiometric characterization of the weatherproof RGB camera HaloCam(RAw) and demonstrate its application in a case study. This characterization procedure can be generalized to other RGB camera systems with similar field of view. HaloCam(RAW) is part of the automated halo observation system HaloCam and designed for the quantitative analysis of halo displays. The geometric calibration was performed using a chessboard pattern to estimate camera matrix and distortion coefficients. For the radiometric characterization of HaloCam(RAW), the dark signal and vignetting effect were determined to correct the measured signal. Furthermore, the spectral response of the RGB sensor and the linearity of its radiometric response were characterized. The absolute radiometric response was estimated by cross calibrating HaloCam(RAW) against the completely characterized spectrometer of the Munich Aerosol Cloud Scanner (specMACS). For a typical measurement signal the relative (absolute) radiometric uncertainty amounts to 2.8 % (5.0 %), 2.4 % (5.8 %), and 3.3 % (11.8 %) for the red, green, and blue channel, respectively. The absolute radiometric uncertainty estimate is larger mainly due to the inhomogeneity of the scene used for cross calibration and the absolute radiometric uncertainty of specMACS.

WoS,Energy analysis for internet of things software: A simulator approach,"This Letter reports a method to obtain fine-grained energy consumption analysis of programs running on the low-power internet of things (IoT) devices. In the energy estimation domain, most state-of-the-art solutions focus on the coarse-grained approach to monitor the energy consumption of a device or an application. However, few solutions addressed energy monitoring to analyse fine-grained energy consumption of a program, especially for IoT appliances. Therefore, the authors present a fine-grained gem5-based energy profiling tool to help developers to evaluate the energy efficiency of hot spots in their programs. The authors demonstrate its usability by applying it to profiling garbage collection and property lookup in Jerryscript, a JavaScript engine specifically designed for resource-constrained IoT devices, and discover that these two operations are consuming, as they account for 17.67 and 12.26% of total energy, respectively. Therefore, this tool can aid the developers to gain insight into the energy efficiency of their software.",storage management; Internet of Things; power aware computing; energy consumption; energy analysis; simulator approach; fine-grained energy consumption analysis; things devices; energy estimation domain; coarse-grained approach; energy monitoring; fine-grained gem5-based energy profiling tool; energy efficiency; profiling garbage collection; property lookup; resource-constrained IoT devices; total energy; Internet of Things software,"Zhu, LY; Lin, QY; Liu, F",2020.0,Journal,ELECTRONICS LETTERS,10.1049/el.2020.0656,"[Zhu, Lingyu] Natl Univ Def Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Lin, Qingyin; Liu, Fang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China",INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET,English,0013-5194,
WoS,Use of interactive instructional tools in virtual 3D planning,"Objectives The aim of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of screencast training videos for users from different professional backgrounds on the basis of the quality and quantity of virtual 3D implant planning as evaluated using assessment software. Methods Participants in the study were dental students (n = 21), dental technicians (n = 16), or practicing dentists (n = 16) with no knowledge of the implant planning software CoDiagnostiX or any experience in virtual implant planning. They were randomly divided into 2 groups: The participants of the control group were presented training videos on CBCT (cone beam computed tomography) and implant planning, additional to the traditional software manual. The participants of the experimental group received, additionally, a training video on the planning software, produced in the form of a screencast. Then 3 implant planning procedures were performed by all participants. The quality of implant planning was assessed using the Treatment Evaluation Tool software, and time for planning was measured. Results Paired sample tests showed significantly shorter planning times for the experimental groups consisting of dentists and students (P< 0.001). A comparison of the results of the individual groups reveals that students and dental technicians who had not received prior screencast training were significantly less precise in their planning (P< 0.001). Conclusion This study suggests a promising outcome for the future use of screencasts in the acquisition of software skills for dental software.

WoS,The Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR): a novel approach for examining social environments in youth sport,"The interactions between athletes, parents, and coaches outside of the immediate training and competition environments can shape sport participants' overall experiences. Accordingly, researchers have explored novel approaches that enable the investigation of experiences that occur beyond the sport activity itself. Technological innovations, combined with careful ethical considerations, have led to the development of research methods that can be used to assess participant conversations in their natural sport and social environments. This article introduces sport researchers to the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), an ambulatory ecological assessment method that provides access to daily social interactions among athletes, parents, and coaches within and beyond the immediate sport activity (e.g. commute to/from activity, locker rooms, hotels). The EAR software is embedded within a portable device (e.g. Android device) and is programmed to record brief segments of audio from participants' daily lives. In addition to discussing the utility of this approach for sport contexts, we introduce the Audio Coding System for Social Environments in Sport (ACSSES), which was developed to assess the interactions captured from athletes' natural sport and social environments using the EAR. Evidence for the reliability and validity of the ACSSES, the associated coder training protocol, and proposed implications for research are discussed.",Behavioural observation; coding system; social identity; moral behaviour; youth sport,"Herbison, JD; Martin, LJ; Slatcher, RB; Boardley, I; Benson, A; Sutcliffe, J; McLaren, C; Carre, JM; Cote, J; Coletti, JT; Bruner, MW",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1080/1750984X.2020.1790025,"[Herbison, Jordan D.; Martin, Luc J.; Cote, Jean; Coletti, Jennifer T.] Queens Univ, Sch Kinesiol & Hlth Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Slatcher, Richard B.] Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Boardley, Ian] Univ Birmingham, Sch Sport Exercise & Rehabil Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Benson, Alex] Western Univ, Dept Psychol, London, ON, Canada; [Sutcliffe, Jordan; McLaren, Colin; Carre, Justin M.; Bruner, Mark W.] Nipissing Univ, Schulich Sch Educ, North Bay, ON, Canada","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",English,1750-984X,
WoS,The depth of brand engagement funnel: dimensionalizing interaction in social media brand communities,"Purpose This paper aims to contribute to the augmenting literature on consumer brand engagement (CBE) in social media brand communities (SMBCs) by offering the model of the depth of brand engagement funnel (DOBEF). The model is intended to complement the multi-dimensional conceptualization of CBE in the extant consumer behaviour literature and to critically address some of its foundational tenets. Design/methodology/approach A computer-mediated discourse analytic (CMDA) approach is adopted while using a mixed methods research design whereby qualitative data are quantified with a view to enhancing the robustness of the interpretive procedure. The data comprise 170 UGC posts stemming from three fast-moving consumer goods brands' SMBC threads. Additionally, a netnographic approach is adopted in data collection, while data analysis/synthesis proceeds with the application of the laddering technique with the aid of the computer-aided qualitative discourse analytic CAQDAS software atlas.ti. Findings The bulk of user-generated content (UGC) in the scrutinized brand initiated thematic threads were found to be relevant, albeit negatively valenced or lacking in relevance altogether. This behavioural response pattern to brand initiated themes poses significant constraints to the level and quality of CBE. Multi-dimensional engagement across the DOBEF's strata was found to be scarce, while engagement diminishes gravely as the upper layers of the model are reached. Research limitations/implications By conducting analyses on coded data alongside DOBEF's strata, rather than treating consumer comments as raw data, the narrowing down of the semantic focus of posted comments in a thread-specific fashion is enabled, thus meeting the narrow contextualization criterion that is lacking from various studies in the extant literature. Practical implications By shifting focus in identifying CBE levels in SMBCs from attitudinal/behavioural antecedents/outcomes towards the content of the interaction, a nuanced perspective is offered as regards the depth of interaction, while addressing posted comments not only in terms of valencing, but even more importantly of valorization. Social implications By attending closely to incidents of negative brand engagement, and by dimensionalizing engagement along the funnel's strata, a more nuanced understanding of territories where brand communities contribute to the dilution, rather than the enhancement of brand equity was obtained. Originality/value This is the first paper that discusses engagement on the grounds of deeply-laden consumer axiologies and the degree to which these are congruent with specific brand initiated thematic threads in SMBCs. It is anticipated that the discourse analytic (DA) approach that is adopted here will instigate further research that attends to UGC in a small-data, highly context-specific, rather than a big-data vein.",Social media; Brand communities; Laddering; Consumer engagement; Mixed methods; Discourse analysis; Laddering technique; Atlas; ti; Netnography,"Rossolatos, G",2020.0,JournalEA,QUALITATIVE MARKET RESEARCH,10.1108/QMR-03-2019-0041,"[Rossolatos, George] Univ Kassel, Dept English & Amer Studies, Kassel, Germany",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,English,1352-2752,
WoS,Validity of Using Automated Two-Dimensional Video Analysis to Measure Continuous Sagittal Plane Running Kinematics,"Two-dimensional video analysis is commonly used to assess kinematics when three-dimensional motion capture is unavailable. However, videos are often assessed using manual digitization, which limits the ability to extract outcomes that require continuous data. Here, we introduced a method to collect continuous kinematic data in 2D using an inexpensive camera and an open-source automated marker tracking program. We tested the validity of this method by comparing 2D video analysis to 3D motion capture for measuring sagittal-plane running kinematics. Twenty uninjured participants ran on a treadmill for 1-min while lower extremity kinematics were collected simultaneously in 3D using a motion capture system and in 2D using a single digital camera, both at 120 Hz. Knee, ankle, and foot angle at contact, peak knee flexion, knee flexion excursion, and knee-ankle flexion vector coding variability were computed using both the 3D and 2D kinematic data, and were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. The agreement between collection methods was excellent for foot angle at contact and knee flexion excursion, good for ankle and knee angle at contact and knee-ankle vector coding variability, and moderate for peak knee flexion. However, Bland-Altman plots revealed significant differences between the 2D and 3D collection methods, which varied across study participants. These low-cost methods could be useful for collecting continuous sagittal plane running kinematics in non-laboratory settings.",Injury prevention; Rehabilitation; Gait analysis; Motion analysis; Software development,"Peebles, AT; Carroll, MM; Socha, JJ; Schmitt, D; Queen, RM",2020.0,JournalEA,ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,10.1007/s10439-020-02569-y,"[Peebles, Alexander T.; Carroll, Maddy M.; Socha, John J.; Queen, Robin M.] Virginia Tech, Dept Biomed Engn & Mech, 495 Old Turner St,300 Norris Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Schmitt, Daniel] Duke Univ, Dept Evolutionary Anthropol, Durham, NC USA; [Queen, Robin M.] Virginia Tech, Carilion Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Roanoke, VA USA",SPRINGER,English,0090-6964,
WoS,A generalized multiple environmental factors software reliability model with stochastic fault detection process,"Software systems have been widely applied in numerous safety-critical domains; however, large-scale software development is still considered as a complicated and expensive activity. As the latest trends in software industry accelerate the complexity and dependency of software development, such complicated and human-centered process needs to be addressed well. Meanwhile, recent survey investigations (Zhu et al. in J Syst Softw 109:150-160, 2015; Zhu and Pham in J Syst Softw 132:72-84, 2017) revealed that environmental factors, defined from software development, have significant impacts on software reliability. Considering such significant impacts, we first propose a generalized multiple-environmental-factors software reliability growth model with multiple environmental factors and the associated randomness under the martingale framework. The randomness is reflected on the process of detecting software fault. Indeed, this is a stochastic fault detection process. As an illustration, a specific multiple-environmental-factors software reliability growth model incorporating two specific environmental factors,percentage of reused modulesandfrequency of program specification change, is further developed.

WoS,Towards quantitative small-animal imaging on hybrid PET/CT and PET/MRI systems,"Aim Over the past two decades, innovations in small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) have reached an impressive level, which has brought countless opportunities to explore the major puzzles in biomedical research. It is a given that pairing information coming from different imaging modalities renders unprecedented knowledge and provides a great insight into various facets of biological systems, such as anatomy, function, physiology, and metabolism in animal models of human diseases, which are difficult to be beaten by standalone PET scanners. The development of bimodal and tri-modal imaging platforms with advanced software solutions dedicated for quantitative studies in small-animals has spurred academic and industrial interest. However, it is undisputed that the potential success of these scanners in filling the translational gap between human and animal findings, hinges to a great extent upon optimization and standardization of relevant parameters and acquisition protocols, which is often overlooked. Methods This article reviews the trends till 2020 in the field of preclinical PET imaging with emphasize on image reconstruction and quantitative corrections implemented on state-of-the-heart hybrid systems. First, the challenges, limitations, and benefits offered by multi-modality imaging systems are described and then, the most commonly used strategies, as well as novel techniques for image reconstruction and image corrections (attenuation, scattering, normalization, motion, and partial volume effect) are presented. The advantages and disadvantages of different methods are also discussed. We also briefly touch upon the factors that should be considered for reliable kinetic modeling and absolute quantitation in preclinical small animal research. Conclusions Multi-modality imaging has attracted a lot of research, particularly in the preclinical portfolio. Nevertheless, more research is still needed to optimize the conceptual design, reach the limits of quantitative imaging and implement standardized protocols for small-animal studies. Without any doubt, exploring the potential advantages of combined imaging units providing optimal image quality and reliable tools for quantification of biological parameters through standardized imaging protocols is one of the goals of translational research.",Preclinical imaging; Image reconstruction; Kinetic modeling; Multi-modality; Quantification,"Amirrashedi, M; Zaidi, H; Ay, MR",2020.0,ReviewEA,CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING,10.1007/s40336-020-00376-y,"[Amirrashedi, Mahsa; Ay, Mohammad Reza] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Amirrashedi, Mahsa; Ay, Mohammad Reza] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Res Ctr Mol & Cellular Imaging, Tehran, Iran; [Zaidi, Habib] Geneva Univ Hosp, Div Nucl Med & Mol Imaging, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Zaidi, Habib] Univ Geneva, Geneva Univ Neuroctr, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Zaidi, Habib] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Nucl Med & Mol Imaging, NL-9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; [Zaidi, Habib] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Nucl Med, DK-500 Odense, Denmark",SPRINGER-VERLAG ITALIA SRL,English,2281-5872,

WoS,"Modelling, simulation and experimental validation of the milling operation of titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V)","The variation of process conditions during machining operations can bring about undesirable change in the microstructure and mechanical properties of the final product. It can also bring about an increase in the energy requirement of the process as well as reduction in tool life. In a bid to measure, monitor and effectively control the variation of some process parameters during the milling operation of titanium alloy, this work employs a computer-aided based modelling and simulation approach validated via the physical experimentations to investigate the variation of velocity, stress, plastic strain and temperature distributions during the milling operation. The numerical experiment was validated with physical experimentations using the professional infrared video thermometer with LCD display and camera function (MT 696) with infrared temperature range of - 50-1000 degrees C for the temperature measurement in real time. The computer-aided design, modelling and simulation of the milling operation was performed using the commercial software code ABAQUS while the response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for the determination of the feasible range of the process parameters, namely cutting speed (25,000-27,500 m/min), feed per tooth (0.05-0.30 mm) and axial depth of cut (0.50-3.0 mm). The physical experimentations were carried out using a DMU80monoBLOCK Deckel Maho 5-axis CNC milling machine and a mill cutter (SF550: HRC 40-HRC 50). The results obtained showed significant correlation between the numerical and physical experimentations. Furthermore, the infrared video thermometer and camera function (MT 696) demonstrated high sensitivity to temperature variation; hence, it is highly suitable for temperature measurement and monitoring.

WoS,Determination of initial stress state and rock mass deformation modulus at Lavarak HEPP by back analysis using ant colony optimization and multivariable regression analysis,"During the design and construction of a project, determination of geomechanical parameters is a key factor for its success. Back analysis is an appropriate method to reduce in situ and field measurements during site investigation and design phase of the projects. Over the past decades, displacement measurements were used as input data for back analysis of geomechanical parameters. In back analysis, an important factor is to choose an appropriate algorithm to minimize the magnitude of the error function in order to reduce the difference between measured and calculated displacements. In this paper, two methods, i.e. continuous ant colony algorithm (CACA) and multivariable regression (MR), were applied to calculate optimized values for four geomechanical parameters in Lavarak underground hydroelectric power plant cavern in Iran. These four parameters are maximum principal stress, minimum principal stress, the angle between maximum principal stress and the horizontal axis, and the deformation modulus of the rock mass. Initially, back analysis was conducted with CACA. For this purpose, CACA was programmed in Phase2 software used for numerical modelling to calculate the displacement of the measuring points. Then, back analysis of four parameters was done with both linear and nonlinear MR using Phase2, and the optimized values were calculated. According to the Lar Consulting Engineers' data for Lavarak HEPP, the results show lower general error function values of CACA than MR. In other words, CACA algorithm shows better performance for obtaining optimal values and for having more accurate calculations. CACA shows better performance for back-calculation of the maximum principal stress, the angel of maximum principal stress, and the deformation modulus of the rock mass.",Back analysis; Initial stress state; Deformation modulus; Ant colony; Optimization; Lavarak cavern,"Ghorbani, E; Moosavi, M; Hossaini, MF; Assary, M; Golabchi, Y",2020.0,JournalEA,BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,10.1007/s10064-020-01936-2,"[Ghorbani, Ebrahim; Moosavi, Mahdi; Hossaini, Mohammad Farouq; Assary, Mehdi; Golabchi, Yousef] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Min Engn, Tehran, Iran",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1435-9529,

Furthermore, our data revealed that this EEG pattern was independently associated with body shape concerns after controlling for potential socio-demographic and clinical confounding variables.

WoS,R package for statistical inference in dynamical systems using kernel based gradient matching: KGode,"Many processes in science and engineering can be described by dynamical systems based on nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Often ODE parameters are unknown and not directly measurable. Since nonlinear ODEs typically have no closed form solution, standard iterative inference procedures require a computationally expensive numerical integration of the ODEs every time the parameters are adapted, which in practice restricts statistical inference to rather small systems. To overcome this computational bottleneck, approximate methods based on gradient matching have recently gained much attention. The idea is to circumvent the numerical integration step by using a surrogate cost function that quantifies the discrepancy between the derivatives obtained from a smooth interpolant to the data and the derivatives predicted by the ODEs. The present article describes the software implementation of a recent method that is based on the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We provide an overview of the methods available, illustrate them on a series of widely used benchmark problems, and discuss the accuracy-efficiency trade-off of various regularization methods.",Ordinary differential equations; Gradient matching; Reproducing kernel Hilbert space; Regularization; Time warping; Residual bootstrap,"Niu, M; Wandy, J; Daly, R; Rogers, S; Husmeier, D",2020.0,JournalEA,COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS,10.1007/s00180-020-01014-x,"[Niu, Mu; Husmeier, Dirk] Univ Glasgow, Sch Math & Stat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Wandy, Joe; Daly, Ronon] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow Poly, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Rogers, Simon] Univ Glasgow, Sch Comp Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,0943-4062,

Methods Sodium alginatel-cysteine conjugate was prepared and characterized and the same was added into a transdermal formulation along with IPM as a permeation enhancer. Twelve primary formulations were prepared by solvent casting method and evaluated. The results were fed intoDesign Expert (R) Software to obtain optimized formulation. The optimized formulation was evaluated for physicochemical,ex vivopermeation, stability, skin irritation, and pharmacokinetic studies. Results The results of the characterization of prepared sodium alginatel-cysteine conjugate confirmed the thiolation process. Stability studies suggested that the drug was compatible with all the excipients. SEM images of the transdermal patch revealed that the amorphous drug was uniformly distributed. From the design space, the optimized formulation from the polymer's ratio (SA: SACC; 4:6) and IPM 9.5%w/w of polymers weight showed target steady state flux 9.004 mu g/cm(2)/h with maximum drug permeation. The increased target flux and maximum drug permeation from an optimized patch suggested that there was an effect of SACC on ropinirole hydrochloride permeation in the presence of IPM as a permeation enhancer.

WoS,Changes in Gut Microbiome Associated With Co-Occurring Symptoms Development During Chemo-Radiation for Rectal Cancer: A Proof of Concept Study,"Purpose: To examine a) whether there are significant differences in the severity of symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, or depression between patients with rectal cancer who develop co-occurring symptoms and those with no symptoms before and at the end of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT); b) differences in gut microbial diversity between those with co-occurring symptoms and those with no symptoms; and c) whether before-treatment diversity measurements and taxa abundances can predict co-occurrence of symptoms. Methods: Stool samples and symptom ratings were collected from 31 patients with rectal cancer prior to and at the end of (24-28 treatments) CRT. Descriptive statistics were computed and the Mann-Whitney U test was performed for symptoms. Gut microbiome data were analyzed using R's vegan package software. Results: Participants with co-occurring symptoms reported greater severity of fatigue at the end of CRT than those with no symptoms.BacteroidesandBlautia2abundances differed between participants with co-occurring symptoms and those with no symptoms. Our random forest classification (unsupervised learning algorithm) predicted participants who developed co-occurring symptoms with 74% accuracy, using specific phylum, family, and genera abundances as predictors.

WoS,Perceived discrimination in health services and preventive dental attendance in Brazilian adults,"Objectives It is evident that discriminatory attitudes affect different dimensions of personal life, including health. This study aimed to verify the association between perceived discrimination in health services and preventive dental attendance in Brazilian adults. Methods This cross-sectional study used secondary data from the 2013 National Health Survey (PNS), a representative survey of the Brazilian population. The response rate was 91.9%, with 60,202 adults agreeing to complete the oral health self-perception questionnaire. Data were analysed using the software STATA 14.0. A descriptive sample analysis was conducted that considered sample weight as well as an association between health discrimination and factors associated with preventive dental attendance through Poisson regression models. Results Adjusted analysis demonstrated that, regarding the reasons that led to discrimination, lack of money, social class and type of working occupation showed a negative association with preventive dental attendance. Conclusion Our findings show that discrimination perpetuates health inequities. Those with worse social conditions need more assistance as they struggle with discrimination and end up going for a check-up after the disease is established or advanced. Preventive care, which could change the health condition of the disadvantaged population, is often a reality only for those less vulnerable.",dental care; primary prevention; social discrimination,"do Amaral, OL; Menegazzo, GR; Fagundes, MLB; de Sousa, JL; Torres, LHD; Giordani, JMD",2020.0,JournalEA,COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,10.1111/cdoe.12565,"[do Amaral Junior, Orlando Luiz; Menegazzo, Gabriele Rissotto; Fagundes, Maria Laura Braccini; Torres, Luisa Helena do Nascimento; Giordani, Jessye Melgarejo do Amaral] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Postgrad Program Dent Sci, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [de Sousa, Jailson Lopes] Brazilian Inst Geog & Stat, Sao Paulo, Brazil",WILEY,English,0301-5661,
WoS,The Butterfly Affect: impact of development practices on cryptocurrency prices,"The network of developers in distributed ledgers and blockchains open source projects is essential to maintaining the platform: understanding the structure of their exchanges, analysing their activity and its quality (e.g. issues resolution times, politeness in comments) is important to determine how healthy and efficient a project is. The quality of a project affects the trust in the platform, and therefore the value of the digital tokens exchanged over it. In this paper, we investigate whether developers' emotions can effectively provide insights that can improve the prediction of the price of tokens. We consider developers' comments and activity for two major blockchain projects, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, extracted from Github. We measure sentiment and emotions (joy, love, anger, etc.) of the developers' comments over time, and test the corresponding time series (i.e. theaffect time series) for correlations and causality with the Bitcoin/Ethereum time series of prices. Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers' emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price. Moreover, using an artificial recurrent neural network (LSTM), we can show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)-associated with the prediction of the prices of cryptocurrencies-significantly decreases when including the affect time series.",Blockchain; Open source software development; Data mining,"Bartolucci, S; Destefanis, G; Ortu, M; Uras, N; Marchesi, M; Tonelli, R",2020.0,Journal,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-00239-6,"[Bartolucci, Silvia] Imperial Coll, Business Sch, London, England; [Destefanis, Giuseppe] Brunel Univ London, London, England; [Ortu, Marco] Univ Cagliari, DIEE, Cagliari, Italy; [Uras, Nicola; Marchesi, Michele; Tonelli, Roberto] Univ Cagliari, DMI, Cagliari, Italy; [Bartolucci, Silvia; Destefanis, Giuseppe] UCL, Ctr Blockchain Technol, London, England",SPRINGER,English,,
WoS,Characteristic differences between IGS final and ray-traced tropospheric delays and their impact on precise point positioning and tropospheric delay estimates,"The length of the convergence time in Precise Point Positioning (PPP) is a result of unmodeled errors. The tropospheric delay error is considered a major error source that affects the PPP solution accuracy and convergence time, especially in the height coordinates. Recent research showed that Numerical Weather Models (NWM)-based tropospheric correction models are superior to traditional empirical tropospheric models. We investigate the tropospheric delay difference between the ray-traced NWM and the final troposphere estimates from the International GNSS Service (IGS). Long time series of about 5 years of tropospheric delay are obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast and compared with the final IGS tropospheric delay time series for 30 globally distributed IGS stations. It is shown that the ray-traced tropospheric delay differences depend on time and experience seasonal variations with a non-zero mean. The mean is found to be 0.47 cm and the standard deviation is 1.40 cm. To model such differences, the least-squares spectral analysis approach is used to estimate the deterministic part of the tropospheric residuals (linear trend and periodic signals). The remaining tropospheric differences are estimated as a random walk process with 5 mm/root h random noise. To study the effect of the developed model on both station position and tropospheric delay estimate, we implement our model in GPS processing software, and the data from 15 IGS stations are processed. These stations are divided into two groups. The first group consists of nine IGS stations from the same network used to estimate the model, and their corresponding model values are extrapolated to the test epochs in 2018. However, the second group consists of six IGS stations, and their corresponding values are interpolated from the nearby stations. It is shown that the root means square error (RMSE) of station position in both groups can be improved by 5.68%, 0.76%, and 11.88% in Easting, Northing, and Up directions, respectively. In addition to the improvement in the RMSE of station positions, an improvement of 7.91% is obtained for total tropospheric delay estimates.",Precise point positioning; Tropospheric delay; Least-squares spectral analysis,"Elsobeiey, ME",2020.0,Journal,GPS SOLUTIONS,10.1007/s10291-020-01012-y,"[Elsobeiey, Mohamed Elsayed] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Maritime Studies, Dept Hydrog Surveying, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1080-5370,
WoS,Using genomics to design and evaluate the performance of underwater forest restoration,"Restoration is an emerging intervention to reverse the degradation and loss of marine habitat-formers and the ecosystem services they underpin. Current best practice seeks to restore populations by transplanting donor individuals chosen to replicate genetic diversity and structure of extant, nearby populations. However, genetic characteristics are rarely empirically examined across generations, despite their potential role in influencing restoration success. We used genomics to design a restoration program for lost underwater forests ofPhyllospora comosa, a dominant forest-forming macroalga that went locally extinct from reefs off Sydney, Australia. Population genetic diversity and structure of nearby extant populations informed choice of donor sites. We tested whether donor provenance influenced adult transplant survival, condition (via metrics of epibiosis) and the genetic characteristics of recruits at restoration sites. Extant populations ofPhyllosporawithin a 100-km radius of Sydney comprised three distinct genetic clusters with similar levels of genetic diversity. We transplanted reproductive adults from two of these sites, with the aim of restoring fivePhyllosporaforests with levels of genetic structure and diversity similar to donor populations. Donor provenance influenced survival and condition of transplanted adults and recruitment levels varied significantly among restoration sites. Yet, recruitment was rapid and genetic diversity and structure of the F(1)generation resembled extant populations. This likely occurred because transplanted individuals reproduced synchronously and rapidly post-transplantation, prior to mortality of adult donor transplants. Synthesis and applications. As restoration and the need to 'future-proof' marine ecosystems increase globally, it will be critical to understand and harness the role of donor provenance, genetic diversity and structure in restoration success. By incorporating ecological and genomic data into restoration design and assessment, this study demonstrates that evidence-based selection of macroalgal donors can result in F(1)generation recruits with similar levels of genetic diversity and structure as extant populations, despite an effect of provenance on transplant survival and condition. This study also highlights the need for ongoing refinement of transplantation techniques to ensure future recruitment success.",climate change; genetic diversity; genomics; kelp; marine ecology; restoration; seaweed; SNPs,"Wood, G; Marzinelli, EM; Verges, A; Campbell, AH; Steinberg, PD; Coleman, MA",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,10.1111/1365-2664.13707,"[Wood, Georgina; Verges, Adriana; Steinberg, Peter D.] Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Ctr Marine Sci & Innovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Marzinelli, Ezequiel M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Marzinelli, Ezequiel M.; Steinberg, Peter D.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore Ctr Environm Life Sci Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Marzinelli, Ezequiel M.; Verges, Adriana; Steinberg, Peter D.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Campbell, Alexandra H.] Univ Sunshine Coast, USC Seaweed Res Grp, Sunshine Coast, Qld, Australia; [Coleman, Melinda A.] Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Primary Ind, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia",WILEY,English,0021-8901,

WoS,Identification of Biomarkers for Sarcoidosis and Tuberculosis of the Lung Using Systematic and Integrated Analysis,"Background: Sarcoidosis (SARC) is a multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown etiology and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Both of these diseases affect lungs and lymph nodes and share similar clinical manifestations. However, the underlying mechanisms for the similarities and differences in genetic characteristics of SARC and PTB remain unclear. Material/Methods: Three datasets (GSE16538, GSE20050, and GSE19314) were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SARC and PTB were identified using GEO2R online analyzer and Venn diagram software. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and R packages. Two protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database, and module analysis was performed using Cytoscape. Hub genes were identified using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: We identified 228 DEGs, including 56 common SARC-PTB DEGs (enriched in interferon-gamma-mediated signaling, response to gamma radiation, and immune response) and 172 SARC-only DEGs (enriched in immune response, cellular calcium ion homeostasis, and dendritic cell chemotaxis).

WoS,Six reference-quality genomes reveal evolution of bat adaptations,"Bats possess extraordinary adaptations, including flight, echolocation, extreme longevity and unique immunity. High-quality genomes are crucial for understanding the molecular basis and evolution of these traits. Here we incorporated long-read sequencing and state-of-the-art scaffolding protocols(1)to generate, to our knowledge, the first reference-quality genomes of six bat species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum,Rousettus aegyptiacus,Phyllostomus discolor,Myotis myotis,Pipistrellus kuhliiandMolossus molossus). We integrated gene projections from our 'Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments' (TOGA) software with de novo and homology gene predictions as well as short- and long-read transcriptomics to generate highly complete gene annotations. To resolve the phylogenetic position of bats within Laurasiatheria, we applied several phylogenetic methods to comprehensive sets of orthologous protein-coding and noncoding regions of the genome, and identified a basal origin for bats within Scrotifera. Our genome-wide screens revealed positive selection on hearing-related genes in the ancestral branch of bats, which is indicative of laryngeal echolocation being an ancestral trait in this clade. We found selection and loss of immunity-related genes (including pro-inflammatory NF-kappa B regulators) and expansions of anti-viral APOBEC3 genes, which highlights molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the exceptional immunity of bats. Genomic integrations of diverse viruses provide a genomic record of historical tolerance to viral infection in bats. Finally, we found and experimentally validated bat-specific variation in microRNAs, which may regulate bat-specific gene-expression programs. Our reference-quality bat genomes provide the resources required to uncover and validate the genomic basis of adaptations of bats, and stimulate new avenues of research that are directly relevant to human health and disease(1). Reference-quality genomes for six bat species shed light on the phylogenetic position of Chiroptera, and provide insight into the genetic underpinnings of the unique adaptations of this clade.",,"Jebb, D; Huang, ZX; Pippel, M; Hughes, GM; Lavrichenko, K; Devanna, P; Winkler, S; Jermiin, LS; Skirmuntt, EC; Katzourakis, A; Burkitt-Gray, L; Ray, DA; Sullivan, KAM; Roscito, JG; Kirilenko, BM; D?valos, LM; Corthals, AP; Power, ML; Jones, G; Ransome, RD; Dechmann, DKN; Locatelli, AG; Puechmaille, SJ; Fedrigo, O; Jarvis, ED; Hiller, M; Vernes, SC; Myers, EW; Teeling, EC",2020.0,Journal,NATURE,10.1038/s41586-020-2486-3,"[Jebb, David; Pippel, Martin; Winkler, Sylke; Roscito, Juliana G.; Kirilenko, Bogdan M.; Hiller, Michael; Myers, Eugene W.] Max Planck Inst Mol Cell Biol & Genet, Dresden, Germany; [Jebb, David; Roscito, Juliana G.; Kirilenko, Bogdan M.; Hiller, Michael] Max Planck Inst Phys Komplexer Syst, Dresden, Germany; [Jebb, David; Pippel, Martin; Roscito, Juliana G.; Kirilenko, Bogdan M.; Hiller, Michael; Myers, Eugene W.] Ctr Syst Biol Dresden, Dresden, Germany; [Huang, Zixia; Hughes, Graham M.; Jermiin, Lars S.; Power, Megan L.; Locatelli, Andrea G.; Teeling, Emma C.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Lavrichenko, Ksenia; Devanna, Paolo; Vernes, Sonja C.] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Neurogenet Vocal Commun Grp, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Jermiin, Lars S.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Jermiin, Lars S.] Univ Coll Dublin, Earth Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Skirmuntt, Emilia C.; Katzourakis, Aris] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Peter Medawar Bldg Pathogen Res, Oxford, England; [Burkitt-Gray, Lucy] Univ Coll Dublin, Conway Inst Biomol & Biomed Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Ray, David A.; Sullivan, Kevin A.

WoS,The use of the geometric morphometric method to illustrate shape difference in the skulls of different-aged horses,"The geometric morphometrics method (GMM) is a technique to study scale and shape relationships of structures using Cartesian geometric coordinates rather than linear, areal (of area), or volumetric variables. GMM has been of great value in many biological studies, but does not appear to have been used to examine equine skulls. In this exploratory study, twenty-nine normal equine heads of three different age groups: <5 years old (N = 9), 6-15 years old (N = 10) and > 16 years old (N = 10) were examined. Computed tomography (CT) bone window DICOM images were reconstructed into isosurfaces (3-dimensional contoured surfaces), onto which landmarks were added using Stratovan Checkpoint (R) software. Data from 29 landmarks were analysed using MorphoJ analysis, which applies a Procrustes fit, prior to reducing data dimensionality through principal component (PC) analysis. PCs with and without allometry were considered. Allometric shape described by PC1 accounted for 27% of variance. Loading pertaining to: the pterygoid process, bilaterally; caudal aspect of hard palate; tip of nasal bone; ethmoid sinuses, bilaterally; caudal aspect of the ventral conchal bulla, bilaterally and caudal aspect of the vomer bone suggest that these anatomical structures are predictive of age group. When allometric effects (shape variation explained by size) were removed, PC1 was unable to distinguish horses by age group. Allometric shape differences could distinguish the youngest versus the two older age groups.

Methods and results Twenty-four candidate diabetic kidney disease-susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 208 participants with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease and 200 participants with type 2 diabetes without diabetic kidney disease (case and control groups, respectively), together with 206 healthy participants using MassARRAY. Rs11643718 in theSLC12A3gene was associated with diabetic kidney disease in the recessive model after adjusting for confounding factors, such as age and gender (adjusted odds ratio 2.056, 95% CI 1.120-3.776;P= 0.020). Meta-analyses further confirmed the association (P= 0.002). In addition, participants with theGGgenotype had worse renal function and more albuminuria than those with theAA+AGgenotype (P< 0.05). Renal section immunohistochemistry was conducted in participants with type 2 diabetes, diabetic kidney disease andAA+AGorGGgenotypes and in participants with glomerular minor lesions. Together with data from the Nephroseq database, it was shown that the abundance ofSLC12A3was reduced in patients with theGGgenotype, while elevated expression ofSLC12A3was associated with better renal function. In addition, rs10951509 and rs1345365 inELMO1, which were determined to be in high linkage disequilibrium by SHEsis software, were also associated with diabetic kidney disease (adjustedP= 0.010 and 0.015, respectively).

WoS,A non-codingRNASEH1gene variant associates with type 1 diabetes and interacts withHLA tagSNPsin families from Colombia,"Objectives RNASEH1gene has recently been associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Colombia. The purpose of this study was to fine mapping the putative functional variant inRNASEH1and testing its interaction withHLAtagSNPs. Methods Two-hundred nuclear families with T1D were included in this study. Probands were tested for GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies. Genotyping was performed using 20 coding tagSNPs uncovered through Sanger sequencing (N = 96), in addition to 23 tagSNPs chosen from 1000genomes to cover the extent of the gene region. Also, 45 tagSNPs for classic HLA alleles associated with T1D were also genotyped. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to test for association and a multiple testing correction was made using permutation. Interaction betweenRNASEH1variants and HLA was evaluated by means of the M-TDT test. Results We identified 20 variants (15 were novel) in the 96 patients sequenced. None of these variants were in linkage disequilibrium. In total, 43RNASEH1variants were genotyped in the 200 families. Association between T1D andrs7607888was identified (P= .002). Haplotype analysis involvingrs7607888variant revealed even stronger association with T1D (most significativeP= .0003). HLA tagSNPs displayed stronger associations (OR = 6.39, 95% CI = 4.33-9.44,P-value = 9.74E-28). Finally, we found several statistically significant interactions of HLA variants withrs7607888(P-value ranged from 8.77E-04 to 5.33E-12).

WoS,Three-dimensional design of a geometric model for an ocular prosthesis in ex vivo anophthalmic socket models,"Purpose Fitting a customized ocular prosthesis for anophthalmic patients entails an artisanal labour-exhausting process and is standardly based on impression moulding of the socket, which may be anatomically inaccurate. The objective of the study was to design an impression-free socket mould with three-dimensional (3D) technology. Methods The ex vivo anophthalmic socket models included one silicone, one fresh pig cadaver head and three fresh-frozen human cadaver heads. After intra-socket application with iodine substance, five observers obtained eighteen low-dose cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and one observer one high-dose CBCT scan of each model. The observers designed non-impression 3D moulds of the socket with 3D software. For the human cadaver sockets 3D geometric models of the ocular prosthesis were rendered from the 3D mould of the socket and the mirrored cornea of the contralateral eye. Results The posterior surface of the 3D mould was highly accurate, with a mean absolute deviation of 0.28 mm, 0.53 mm, 0.37 mm and mean upper deviation of 0.53 mm, 0.86 mm, 1.17 mm, respectively, for the phantom, pig and human model. The intra- and interobserver repeatability and reproducibility of the 3D moulds and designs was good (<0.35 mm). The largest variation in the 3D geometric model was found at the junction of the 3D mould and mirrored cornea.

WoS,Prediction of Surface Subsidence Due to Mining,"Ground subsidence caused by mining is increasing day by day, and some enormous disasters have been brought. Some scholars have carried out some results by a single factor analysis, but did not consider the multi-working conditions, resulting in a certain deviation from the actual project. Accurate and effective prediction of subsidence caused by coal mining is an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, the main factors affecting surface subsidence in mining area, which are coal seam thickness and mining depth, are studied by means of composite analysis method. At the same time, three-dimensional finite element method is employed to simulate different engineering conditions. According to the simulation maximum value settlements, fitting through MATLAB software, the corresponding predicted models are established. Comparing with the actual engineering survey data, it is proved that the settlement prediction curve is in good agreement with each other.

WoS,Measuring productivity of healthcare services under environmental constraints: evidence from China,"Background Despite the growing literature on the efficiency and productivity of the Chinese healthcare system, less attention has been given to examining the undesirable outputs linked to healthcare services, including environmental pollution. Taking the atmospheric environmental pollution resulting from the incineration of medical waste as an undesirable output of the healthcare system, this study analyzed the growth and decomposition of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of healthcare services across 31 Chinese provinces during the period 2005-2016. Methods The Meta-frontier undesirable super-efficiency slack-based measure (SBM) model and the Global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) Index were employed to analyze the growth and decomposition of TFP using the Max DEA software. Results The results revealed that the years 2009 and 2015 marked significant changes in TFP of healthcare services in Chinese provinces. During the study period, the rate of technological change (TC) slowly declined, whereas the rate of efficiency change (EC) steadily increased. With the national average being the benchmark, the results indicated that: the TFP of 17 provinces and cities exceeded the average, the EC of 16 provinces and cities exceeded the average, the TC of 9 provinces and cities exceeded the average, and the value in the Technology Gap Ratio (TGR) changes of 13 provinces and cities were above the national average. Conclusions (1) The TFP of the healthcare services across China continued to decline slowly during the study period. (2) The effect of technical catch-up in the eastern, central, and western regions of China was significant across the three regions, whereas the effect of technical innovation was negative. (3) The TFP varied considerably among the Chinese provinces. These findings suggest that, under existing environmental constraints, relevant government departments should improve technical innovation in the supply of healthcare services and medical waste treatment, increase technical efficiency in the factor of healthcare production, strengthen regional health planning, and balance the development of regional healthcare.",Healthcare services; TFP; Undesirable output; GML index; Meta-frontier super efficiency SBM model,"Yu, JN; Liu, Z; Zhang, TT; Hatab, AA; Lan, J",2020.0,Journal,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,10.1186/s12913-020-05496-9,"[Yu, Jinna] Guizhou Minzu Univ, Sch Business, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhen] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210046, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tingting] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Hatab, Assem Abu] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, POB 7013, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Hatab, Assem Abu] Arish Univ, Dept Econ & Rural Dev, Al Arish 45511, North Sinai, Egypt; [Lan, Jing] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China",BMC,English,,
WoS,Anatomical factors associated with femoral neck fractures of elderly Beijing women,"The Summary Analyses using newly developed structural measures of minimal model (aBMD, W, Sigma, Delta) in a Chinese female age-matched cohort of femoral neck fracture patients and non-fracture community controls resulted in improved fracture prediction, suggesting the usefulness of new variables, extending the value of widely available DXA technology. Introduction We have developed a new approach to evaluate 2D femoral neck (FN) structure, the minimal model (MM). This model includes FNaBMD and FNWidth with two new internal structural measures, the standard deviation of normalized mineral mass projection profile distribution (FNSigma) and the displacement between center of mineral (CoM) mass and geometric center of mineral mass projection profile (FNDelta). Methods Differences in these four structural measurements together with age, weight, and height were compared in the contralateral hip of 285 FN fracture Chinese female patients and 261 age-matched community controls. Structural variables were calculated from DXA equivalent 2D images obtained from QCT scans analyzed using Mindways Software. Results Review of FN scanned profiles of fracture patients and controls identified substantial reduction in mineral mass in the superior segment of FN. Fracture participants were taller, weighed less, and had lower FNaBMD and larger FNDelta, due to a larger inferior displacement in the CoM, consistent with greater reduction in superior segment bone. Logistic regression identified increased height, reduced FNaBMD, increased FNDelta, and reduced FNSigma per SD as significant independent contributors to differentiating fracture from non-fracture. Area under ROC analysis identified significant improvement in discrimination with the addition of FNDelta and FNSigma to the model including age, height, weight, and FNaBMD (C statistic 0.87 and 0.84 respectively). Conclusions These data extend previous data that identified the benefit of 2D FN internal structural information in discriminating those at increased future fracture risk from recently fractured individuals. These data support continuing investigation of MM analysis as a straightforward analytical approach adding value to DXA hip aBMD in predicting fracture risk.",Structural geometry; Chinese; Proximal femur; Sigma; Delta; Quantitative computer tomography,"Khoo, BCC; Wang, L; Lewis, JR; Brown, K; Cheng, XG; Prince, RL",2020.0,Journal,ARCHIVES OF OSTEOPOROSIS,10.1007/s11657-020-00780-x,"[Khoo, Benjamin Cheng Choon] Sir Charles Gairdner Hosp, Med Technol & Phys, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Khoo, Benjamin Cheng Choon] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biomed Sci, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Wang, Ling; Cheng, Xiaoguang] Beijing Jishuitan Hosp, Dept Radiol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lewis, Joshua Richard] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Joondalup, WA, Australia; [Lewis, Joshua Richard; Prince, Richard Lewis] Univ Western Australia, Med Sch, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Brown, Keenan] Mindways Software, Austin, TX USA; [Prince, Richard Lewis] Sir Charles Gairdner Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Diabet, Nedlands, WA, Australia",SPRINGER LONDON LTD,English,1862-3522,
WoS,Intrinsic patient factors predictive of inpatient rehabilitation facility discharge following primary total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) reduces pain and improves function in those suffering from severe osteoarthritis. A significant cost of TKA is post-acute care, however, current evidence suggests that discharge to an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) has inferior outcomes to home discharge, with no greater benefit in physical function. Only individual studies have investigated TKA patient characteristics predictive of discharge destination, therefore, the aim is to systematically review the literature and meta-analyse intrinsic patient factors predictive of IRF discharge. If predictive factors are known, then early discharge planning and intervention strategies could be implemented. Methods: Databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane, and Pedro were searched up to October 2019 for all studies investigating pre-operative intrinsic patient factors predictive of IRF discharge. For assessing the methodological quality of included studies, the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool was used. Statistical analysis and graphical reporting were conducted in R statistical software. To assess the effect of predictors of discharge destination, odds ratios with the corresponding 95%CI were extracted from the results of univariate and multivariable analyses. Results: A total of 9 articles published between 2011 to 2018 with 218,151 TKA patients were included. Of the 13 intrinsic patient factors reported, 6 met the criteria for synthesised review: age, obesity, comorbidity, gender, SF-12/VR-12 survey, and smoking. Due to the heterogeneity of statistical analysis and reporting 2 variables could undergo meta-analysis, gender and smoking. Female gender increased the likelihood of IRF discharge by 78% (OR = 1.78; 95%CI = 1.43-2.20; I2 = 33.3%), however, the relationship between smoking status and discharge destination was less certain (OR = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.42-1.50; I2 = 68.5%). Conclusion: In this systematic literature review and meta-analysis female gender was shown to be predictive of IRF discharge after total knee arthroplasty. There was also a trend for those of older age and increased comorbidity, as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, or the severely obese to have an increased likelihood of IRF discharge. The marked heterogeneity of statistical methods and reporting in existing literature made pooled analysis challenging for intrinsic patient factors predictive of IRF discharge after TKA. Further, high quality studies of prospective design on predictive factors are warranted, to enable early discharge planning and optimise resource allocation on post-acute care following TKA.",Total knee arthroplasty (TKA); Rehabilitation; Discharge; Predictors; Systematic review; Meta-analysis,"Sattler, L; Hing, W; Rathbone, E; Vertullo, C",2020.0,Review,BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS,10.1186/s12891-020-03499-5,"[Sattler, Larissa; Hing, Wayne; Rathbone, Evelyne] Bond Univ, Bond Inst Hlth & Sport, Promethean Way, Robina, Qld 4226, Australia; [Vertullo, Christopher] Knee Res Australia, 8-10 Carrara St, Benowa, Qld 4217, Australia",BMC,English,,
WoS,Cardiovascular disease prevention knowledge and associated factors among adults in Mukono and Buikwe districts in Uganda,"Background: With the growing epidemic of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in sub-Saharan Africa, behavioural change interventions are critical in supporting populations to achieve better cardiovascular health. Population knowledge regarding CVD is an important first step for any such interventions. This study examined CVD prevention knowledge and associated factors among adults in Mukono and Buikwe districts in Uganda. Methods: The study was cross-sectional in design conducted among adults aged 25 to 70 years as part of the baseline assessment by the Scaling-up Packages of Interventions for Cardiovascular disease prevention in selected sites in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa (SPICES) - project. Data were collected using pretested semi-structured questionnaires, and respondents categorized as knowledgeable if they scored at least five out of six in the knowledge questions. Data were exported into STATA version 15.0 statistical software for analysis conducted using mixed-effects Poisson regression with fixed and random effects and robust standard errors. Results: Among the 4372 study respondents, only 776 (17.7%) were knowledgeable on CVD prevention. Most respondents were knowledgeable about foods high in calories 2981 (68.2%), 2892 (66.1%) low fruit and vegetable intake and high salt consumption 2752 (62.9%) as CVD risk factors. However, majority 3325 (76.1%) thought the recommended weekly moderate physical activity was 30 min and half 2262 (51.7%) disagreed or did not know that it was possible to have hypertension without any symptoms. Factors associated with high CVD knowledge were: post-primary education [APR = 1.55 (95% CI: 1.18-2.02), p = 0.002], formal employment [APR = 1.69 (95% CI: 1.40-2.06), p < 0.001] and high socio-economic index [APR = 1.35 (95% CI: 1.09-1.67), p = 0.004]. Other factors were: household ownership of a mobile phone [APR = 1.35 (95% CI: 1.07-1.70), p = 0.012] and ever receiving advice on healthy lifestyles [APR = 1.38 (95% CI: 1.15-1.67), p = 0.001]. Conclusions: This study found very low CVD knowledge with major gaps around recommended physical activity duration, diet and whether hypertension is asymptomatic.

WoS,Unmanned aircraft automatic flight control algorithm in a spin maneuver,"Purpose The paper aims to present an idea of automatic control algorithms dedicated to both small manned and unmanned aircraft, capable to perform spin maneuver automatically. This is a case of maneuver far away from so-called standard flight. The character of this maneuver and the range of aircraft flight parameters changes restrict application of standard control algorithms. Possibility of acquisition full information about aircraft flight parameters is limited as well in such cases. This paper analyses an alternative solution that can be applied in some specific cases. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses theoretical discussion and breakdowns to create basics for development of structures of control algorithms. Simplified analytical approach was applied to tune regulators. Results of research were verified in series of software-in-the loop, computer simulations. Findings The structure of the control system enabling aerobatic flight (spin flight as example selected) was found and the method how to tune regulators was presented as well.

WoS,"Automated synthesis, preclinical toxicity, and radiation dosimetry of [F-18]MC225 for clinical use: a tracer for measuring P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier","Introduction [F-18]MC225 is a selective substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that has good metabolic stability and shows higher baseline uptake compared with other P-gp substrates such as (R)-[C-11]Verapamil. Prior to clinical translation, it is necessary to perform process validation of the radiosynthesis, assessment of preclinical toxicity, and radiation dosimetry. Methods The production of [F-18]MC225 was automated on a CFN-MPS200 multipurpose synthesizer. The acute toxicity of MC225 was evaluated at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg bodyweight, which is more than 10,000-fold the postulated maximum clinical dose of [F-18]MC225. The acute toxicity of [F-18]MC225 injection at a 200-fold dose, to administer a postulated dose of 185 MBq of [F-18]MC225, was also evaluated after the decay-out of(18)F. The mutagenicity of MC225 was studied by a reverse mutation test usingSalmonella typhimuriumandEscherichia coli(Ames test). In vivo biodistribution and dosimetry studies of [F-18]MC225 were carried out in normal mice. Human dosimetry was estimated using OLINDA software. Results The mean decay-corrected yields of [F-18]MC225 at end of synthesis were 13%, with > 99% radiochemical purity, > 1000 GBq/mu mol molar activity, and <= 1.5 mu g/185 MBq of total chemical contents. All process validation batches complied with the product specifications and the process was confirmed to be appropriate for the production of [F-18]MC225. No acute toxicity of MC225 or [F-18]MC225 injection was found. No mutagenic activity was observed for MC225. The biodistribution study demonstrated both hepatobiliary and renal excretion of radioactivity. The most critical organ was the pancreas, with (63.8 mu Gy/MBq) or without urination (63.9 mu Gy/MBq) at 360 min after injection. The estimated effective dose (mu Sv/MBq) with and without urination at 360 min after injection was calculated as 15.7 and 16.9, respectively.

WoS,Knowledge sharing and absorptive capacity: interdependency and complementarity,"Purpose This study aims to resolve contradictions in the literature regarding the relationship between knowledge sharing (KS) and absorptive capacity (AC). The authors analyze the reasons for which KS has been interpreted as an antecedent and those for which it has been seen as a consequent of AC. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a systematic review of the literature to identify the arguments supporting the relationships between the constructs and propose a model. Additionally, the hypotheses were tested using SEM to assess the proposed model. Findings The findings reveal the nature of the relationship between KS and AC. Suggesting AC is bi-dimensional, consisting of potential AC and realized AC, while the relationship between these two dimensions depends on KS. Research limitations/implications This study provides consistent theoretical grounds for future empirical research. The study findings demonstrate KS provides a real contribution towards AC, validating the previous literature on the impact of KS antecedents on realized AC. Additionally, the authors provide evidence to suggest knowledge donation is an output of the AC process, thus generating a debate on the nature of knowledge donation (requested vs unrequested), which raises interesting research questions to be addressed in the future. As a limitation, empirical data was only collected in the context of software development in two countries. Practical implications The results elucidate the central role of knowledge collection within AC. For managers, the importance of the role of knowledge collection to fully benefit from AC and exploit knowledge is highlighted. Originality/value The research design is original in that it combines a systematic and integrative literature review to the ground and propose hypotheses with empirically testing of the emerging model.

We tested a software approach to assist the clinician in making the diagnosis based on clinical findings and an annotated genomic variant table, using cases already solved using less automated processes. Results For the 81 cases studied (involving 216 individuals), 70 had genetic abnormalities with phenotypes previously described in the literature, and 11 were not described in the literature at the time of analysis (discovery genes). These included cases beyond a trio, including ones with different variants in the same gene. In 100% of cases the abnormality was recognized. Of the 70, the abnormality was ranked #1 in 94% of cases, with an average rank 1.1 for all cases. Large CNVs could be analyzed in an integrated analysis, performed in 24 of the cases.

WoS,"Whole genomic analysis of a potential recombinant human adenovirus type 1 in Qinghai plateau, China","Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are prevalent in patients with respiratory infections, in which recombination has important implications for viral detection and pathogenicity. However, less HAdVs recombination was reported in Qinghai plateau. In this study, we obtained an HAdV-C strain (QH-1665/2018) isolated from an infant aged one month with influenza-like illness in Qinghai Province in 2018. The whole genome sequence was generated by next-generation sequencing, and compared with that of other HAdV-C strains available in public. The strain QH-1665/2018 genome is comprised of 36,014 nucleotides and encoded 36 putative proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of complete HAdV genomes and 3 major antigen genes (penton, hexon and fiber) showed that strain QH-1665/2018 was clustered into HAdV-1 [P1H1F1]. Recombination analysis based on the RDP4 package and SimPlot software showed that QH-1665/2018 was a recombinant involving HAdV-1, HAdV-2 and HAdV-5, which was then re-confirmed by phylogenetic analysis.

WoS,Transport and trajectory of cough-induced bimodal aerosol in an air-conditioned space,"Aerosol generated from a human cough can be a potential major indoor health risk due to the possible transmission of infectious respiratory diseases to surrounding individuals within the same room and even could spread out via air-ventilation/conditioning systems. This study aims to investigate the transport characteristics and trajectory of coughed aerosols under the influence of conditioned air ventilation as well as near-by human breathing zone using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). An experimental system consisting of air-conditioned space with multiple inlets and outlets, a cough simulator and a receiver was built to validate the CFD predictions. The comparison is in good agreement. The CFD model was established as a transient three-dimensional multiphase multicomponent Eulerian-Lagrangian model and numerically solved using commercial software ANSYS Fluent. Both gas and liquid phases were modelled as multicomponent mixtures. With this CFD model, the indoor transport and trajectory of coughed aerosols can be accounted for the distributions of portions inhaled by each manikin, deposited on surfaces of manikins and chamber walls, as well as recirculated back into the ventilation system. Results reveal that the aerosol source location and the ambient air movement can be crucial factors of aerosol trajectory in terms of direct and indirect influence.",Aerosol; Cough; Multiphase; Multicomponent; Transmission of respiratory disease; Air-conditioned space,"Zhang, B; Guo, GY; Zhu, C; Ji, ZM; Lin, CH",2020.0,JournalEA,INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT,10.1177/1420326X20941166,"[Zhang, Bo; Guo, Guangyu; Zhu, Chao; Ji, Zhiming] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Lin, Chao-Hsin] Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Environm Control Syst, Seattle, WA USA",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,English,1420-326X,
WoS,Model Talk: Calculative Cultures in Quantitative Finance,"This paper explores how calculative cultures shape perceptions of models and practices of model use in the financial industry. A calculative culture comprises a specific set of practices and norms concerning data and model use in an organizational setting. Drawing on interviews with model users (data scientists, software developers, traders, and portfolio managers) working in algorithmic securities trading, I argue that the introduction of complex machine-learning models changes the dynamics in calculative cultures, which leads to a displacement of human judgment in quantitative finance. In this paper, I distinguish between three calculative cultures: (1) an idealistic culture of undivided trust in models, (2) a pragmatic culture of skepticism toward model accuracy, and (3) a pragmatic idealist culture of early stage skepticism and implementation and production-phase idealism. Based on the empirical material, the analysis engages with examples of each of the three calculative cultures. The study contributes to the social studies of finance and science and technology studies more broadly by showing how perceptions of models shape and are shaped through model work in data-intensive, computerized finance.",calculative cultures; quantitative finance; machine learning; calculative idealism; calculative pragmatism; judgment,"Hansen, KB",2020.0,JournalEA,SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES,10.1177/0162243920944225,"[Hansen, Kristian Bondo] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B,2-146, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,English,0162-2439,
WoS,CryptoGA: a cryptosystem based on genetic algorithm for cloud data security,"Cloud Computing is referred to as a set of hardware and software that are being combined to deliver various services of computing. The cloud keeps the services for delivery of software, infrastructure, and platform over the Internet based on the user's demand. In the IT industry, cloud computing plays an important role to access services anywhere in the world. With increasing demand and popularity of cloud computing, several types of threats and vulnerabilities are also increased. Data integrity and privacy are the key issues in cloud computing and are thoughtful as the data is stored in different geographical locations. Therefore, data integrity and privacy protection provisions are the most prominent factors of user's concerns about the cloud computing environment. In this paper, a new model based on a genetic algorithm (GA) CryptoGA is proposed to cope with data integrity and privacy issues. GA is used to generate keys for encryption and decryption which are integrated with a cryptographic algorithm to ensure privacy and integrity of cloud data. Known and common parameters i.e. execution time, throughput, key size, and avalanche effect are considered for evaluation and comparison. Ten different datasets are used in experiments for testing and validation. Experimental results analysis show that the proposed model ensures the integrity and preserves the privacy of the user's data against unauthorized parties.

WoS,"Numerical Simulation, Microstructure, properties of EH40 ultra-heavy plate under gradient temperature rolling","This paper investigates the novel gradient temperature rolling process for ultra-heavy plates. Between rolling passes, water cooling is used to create a temperature gradient along the thickness direction of the ultra-heavy plate, which increases deformation of the core and improves the final mechanical properties of the plate. The DEFORM-3D software package was used to simulate the temperature and strain fields of the gradient temperature rolled plate. Simulation results show an obvious temperature gradient along the thickness direction of the plate and during rolling, deformation is more likely to penetrate the core. The surface to core strain ratio decreased from 14.7:1 to 1.8:1 compared to conventional rolling. Furthermore, the results of hot rolling experiments clearly show refinement of the microstructure. A layer of fine grains with an average diameter of about 1-2 mu m formed on the surface of the plate and the average grain size was found to be 6.7% finer at 1/4-thickness and 11.8% finer at 1/2-thickness compared to conventionally rolled sheets. Moreover, the high-angle grain boundaries were 8.7% larger at 1/2-thickness. The microstructure of the gradient temperature rolled plate is mainly ferrite and pearlite with a small amount of granular bainite at the core. The pearlite phase initially exhibits a lamellar structure that is eventually transformed into degraded pearlite. The granular bainite is finer and more uniformly distributed compared to that of a conventional rolling plate. In addition, the yield strength and tensile strength of the gradient temperature rolling plate are higher and less elongation is observed, and the impact energy at low temperatures (-20 degrees C and -40 degrees C) is higher; from the surface to the core as the thickness increases, the decrease in impact energy is even smaller.",Ultra-heavy plate; gradient temperature rolling; Numerical simulation; microstructure; Mechanical property,"Bian, SY; Zhang, X; Li, SL; Zhang, L; Li, WJ; Yan, L",2020.0,Journal,MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING,10.1016/j.msea.2020.139778,"[Bian Shou-yuan; Zhang Xin; Li Sheng-li; Zhang Lin; Li Wei-juan] Univ Sci & Technol Liaoning, Sch Mat & Met, Anshan 114051, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Yan Ling] State Key Lab Met Mat Marine Equipment & Applicat, Anshan 114009, Liaoning, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,English,0921-5093,

WoS,A Study on Various Attacks and Detection Methodologies in Software Defined Networks,"The Software Defined Networks (SDN) is widely used in many industrial and enterprise networking applications due to its flexibility and gaining popularity. It offers various benefits like network virtualization, policy enforcement, greater control, and reduced operational cost. One of the challenging tasks in SDN is to secure the network against the harmful attacks. For this purpose, various attack detection mechanisms are developed in traditional works, which intends to increase the security of SDN by employing different policy enforcement and soft computing techniques. In this paper, a comprehensive survey is presented on various attacks that affect the performance of SDN and its corresponding countermeasure techniques. Typically, the performance of a network can be degraded due to the cause of attacks present on the layers. Also, it leads to reduced Quality of Service (QoS), increased network congestion, and packet drops. So, the attacks present on the layers must be detected or prevented for increasing the performance of SDN. This investigation illustrates various attacks with its causes and the most suitable techniques used for detecting those attacks for improving security.

WoS,"Utility of texture analysis on T2-weighted MR for differentiating tumor deposits from mesorectal nodes in rectal cancer patients, in a retrospective cohort","Objective The purpose of the study was to evaluate the utility of MR texture analysis for differentiating tumor deposits from mesorectal nodes in rectal cancer. Materials and methods Pretreatment MRI of 40 patients performed between 2006 and 2018 with pathologically proven tumor deposits and/or malignant nodes in the setting of rectal cancer were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 25 tumor deposits (TDs) and 71 positive lymph nodes (LNs) were analyzed for morphological and first-order texture analysis features on T2-weighted axial images. MR morphological features (lesion shape, size, signal heterogeneity, contrast enhancement) were analyzed and agreed in consensus by two experienced radiologists followed by assessment with Fisher's exact test. Texture analysis of the lesions was performed using TexRAD, a proprietary software algorithm. First-order texture analysis features (mean, standard deviation, skewness, entropy, kurtosis, MPP) were obtained after applying spatial scaling filters (SSF; 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Univariate analysis was performed with non-parametric Mann-WhitneyUtest. The results of univariate analysis were reassessed with generalized estimating equations followed by multivariate analysis. Using histopathology as a gold standard, diagnostic accuracy was assessed by obtaining area under the receiver operating curve. Results MR morphological parameter, lesion shape was a strong discriminator between TDs and LNs with a p value of 0.02 (AUC: 0.76, 95% CI of 0.66 to 0.84, SE: 0.06) and sensitivity, specificity of 90% and 68%, respectively. Skewness extracted at fine filter (SSF-2) was the only significant texture analysis parameter for distinguishing TDs from LNs with p value of 0.03 (AUC: 0.70, 95% CI of 0.59 to 0.79, SE: 0.06) and sensitivity, specificity of 70% and 72%, respectively. When lesion shape and skewness-2 were combined into a single model, the diagnostic accuracy was improved with AUC of 0.82 (SE: 0.05, 95% CI of 0.72 to 0.88 withpvalue of < 0.01). This model also showed a high sensitivity of 91% with specificity of 68%. Conclusion Lesion shape on MR can be a useful predictor for distinguishing TDs from positive LNs in rectal cancer patients.

WoS,Toric varieties and Grobner bases: the complete Q-factorial case,"We present two algorithms determining all the complete and simplicial fans admitting a fixed non-degenerate set of vectors V as generators of their 1-skeleton. The interplay of the two algorithms allows us to discerning if the associated toric varieties admit a projective embedding, in principle for any values of dimension and Picard number. The first algorithm is slower than the second one, but it computes all complete and simplicial fans supported by V and lead us to formulate a topological-combinatoric conjecture about the definition of a fan. On the other hand, we adapt the Sturmfels' arguments on the Grobner fan of toric ideals to our complete case; we give a characterization of the Grobner region and show an explicit correspondence between Grobner cones and chambers of the secondary fan. A homogenization procedure of the toric ideal associated to V allows us to employing GFAN and related software in producing our second algorithm. The latter turns out to be much faster than the former, although it can compute only the projective fans supported by V. We provide examples and a list of open problems. In particular we give examples of rationally parametrized families of Q-factorial complete toric varieties behaving in opposite way with respect to the dimensional jump of the nef cone over a special fibre.",Toric varieties; Gale duality; Grobner fan; Secondary fan; Initial ideals; Toric ideals,"Rossi, M; Terracini, L",2020.0,JournalEA,APPLICABLE ALGEBRA IN ENGINEERING COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTING,10.1007/s00200-020-00452-w,"[Rossi, Michele; Terracini, Lea] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Matemat, Via Carlo Alberto 10, I-10123 Turin, Italy",SPRINGER,English,0938-1279,
WoS,Biomass steam gasification kinetics: relative impact of char physical properties vs. inorganic composition,"During biomass gasification, both the char physical properties and the biomass inorganic composition are known to have a significant influence on the reaction kinetics. However, the impact of the inorganic content is more pronounced than the impact of the char features, though no clear explanations have been found in the literature yet. In order to clarify this point, two biomass species with significant inorganic composition differences were gasified under steam and the chars obtained at various conversion values were characterized. Both the char physicochemical properties (chemical composition, carbon structure, porosity, and surface chemistry) and the gasification kinetic behavior were analyzed. A particular focus on the inorganic elemental composition and inorganic compound nature were performed. Experimental results were compared with simulation results at thermodynamic equilibrium obtained with the FactSage 7.2 software. The results showed that the physical properties of the carbon matrix do not have a strong influence on the gasification reactivity. In contrast, the inorganic composition could explain the differences between the gasification kinetic behaviors of the two investigated chars (obtained starting from two different biomass sources).",Steam gasification; Reaction kinetics; Inorganic compounds; Char physical properties,"Dahou, T; Defoort, F; Nguyen, HN; Bennici, S; Jeguirim, M; Dupont, C",2020.0,JournalEA,BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY,10.1007/s13399-020-00894-9,"[Dahou, Tilia; Defoort, Francoise] Univ Grenoble Alpes, DTBH, LITEN, CEA, 17 Ave Martyrs, F-38054 Grenoble 09, France; [Dahou, Tilia; Bennici, Simona; Jeguirim, Mejdi] Univ Haute Alsace, CNRS, IS2M UMR 7361, F-68100 Mulhouse, France; [Dahou, Tilia; Bennici, Simona; Jeguirim, Mejdi] Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France; [Dahou, Tilia] Agence Environm & Maitrise Energie ADEME, 20 Ave Gresille,BP 90406, F-49004 Angers 01, France; [Hong Nam Nguyen] Univ Sci & Technol Hanoi USTH, Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Dupont, Capucine] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Westvest 7, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,2190-6815,
WoS,Exploration of Reduced Doses and Short-Cycle Therapy for Darunavir/Cobicistat in Patients with HIV Using Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Simulations,"Background and objectives Protease inhibitors such as darunavir are an important therapeutic option in the anti-human immunodeficiency virus arsenal. Current dosage guidelines recommend using cobicistat- or ritonavir-boosted darunavir 800 mg every 24 h (q24h) in protease inhibitor-naive patients, or ritonavir-boosted darunavir 600 mg q12h in experienced patients. However, darunavir displays a large, poorly characterized, inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. The objectives of this study were to investigate the pharmacokinetics of darunavir and to elucidate the sources of its inter-individual variability using population pharmacokinetic modeling. Then, to determine the appropriateness of current treatment guidelines and the feasibility of alternative dosing regimens in a representative cohort of adult patients using simulations. Methods Sparse pharmacokinetic samples were collected in 127 patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, then supplemented with rich sampling data from a subset of 12 individuals. Data were analyzed using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling software NONMEM. The effect of reduced doses (600 mg q24h and 400 mg q24h) or reduced frequency of administration (800 mg q24h for 5 days followed by 2 days of treatment interruption) was simulated. Results Our model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of darunavir. Predictors of individual exposure wereCYP3A5*3andSLCO3A1rs8027174 genotypes, sex, and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein level. No relationship was apparent between darunavir area under the curve and treatment efficacy or safety. For reduced dose regimens, darunavir concentrations remained above the protein binding-corrected EC(50)in the majority of subjects. More stringent pharmacokinetic targets were not reached in a significant proportion of patients. Conclusions These results add to the growing body of evidence that darunavir-based therapy could be simplified to reduce costs and toxicity, as well as to improve patient compliance. However, the heterogeneity in pharmacokinetic response should be considered when assessing whether individual patients could benefit from a particular regimen, for instance through the use of population pharmacokinetic models.",,"Stillemans, G; Belkhir, L; Vandercam, B; Vincent, A; Haufroid, V; Elens, L",2020.0,JournalEA,CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS,10.1007/s40262-020-00920-z,"[Stillemans, Gabriel; Elens, Laure] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Drug Res Inst, Integrated PharmacoMetr PharmacoGen & PharmacoKin, Brussels, Belgium; [Stillemans, Gabriel; Belkhir, Leila; Haufroid, Vincent; Elens, Laure] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Ctr Toxicol & Appl Pharmacol, Inst Rech Expt & Clin, Brussels, Belgium; [Belkhir, Leila; Vandercam, Bernard; Vincent, Anne] Catholic Univ Louvain, Clin Univ St Luc, AIDS Reference Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Brussels, Belgium; [Haufroid, Vincent] Clin Univ St Luc, Dept Clin Chem, Brussels, Belgium; [Stillemans, Gabriel] Ave E Mounier 72,B01-72-02, Brussels, Belgium",ADIS INT LTD,English,0312-5963,
WoS,Automating test oracles from restricted natural language agile requirements,"Manual testing of software requirements written in natural language for agile or any other methodology requires more time and human resources. This leaves the testing process error prone and time consuming. For satisfied end users with bug-free software delivered on time, there is a need to automate the test oracle process for natural language or informal requirements. The automation of the test oracle is relatively easier with formal requirements, but this task is difficult to achieve with natural language requirements. This study proposes an approach calledRestricted Natural Language Agile Requirements Testing(ReNaLART) to automate the test oracle from restricted natural language agile requirements. For this purpose, it uses an existing user story template with some modifications for writing user stories. This helps in identifying test input and expected output for a user story. For comparison of expected and observed outputs it makes use of a regex pattern and string distance functions. It is capable of assigning different types of verdicts automatically depending upon the similarity/dissimilarity between observed and expected outputs of user stories. ReNaLART is validated using several case studies of different domains, namely, OLX Pakistan, Mental Health Tests, McDelivery Pakistan, BlueStacks, Power Searching with Google, TensorFlow Playground, w3Schools 2018 offline and Touch'D.

WoS,Study on Micro Force Sensor and its Signal Acquisition System Based on Android and Arduino,"Force sensor becomes more and more miniature in order to achieve precise measurement in small place. A magnetostrictive micro sensor was proposed in the paper; meanwhile, the signal acquisition system was designed by Android platform and Arduino MCU to meet the popular mobile terminal. The structure of sensor and the hardware and software of system were designed to realize the functions of force signal acquisition, processing and analysis, and upload the data to mobile terminal in real time. It can be seen from the experimental tests: Firstly, the volume of sensor was less than 2 cm(3)and had good linearity, while the sensitivity was 0.1537 mV/N and the repeatability error was 1.07%. Secondly, the system could effectively enlarge the output value of sensor more than 100 times and the nonlinear error was less than 1.5%, while the linearity and sensitivity can be kept well. This sensor with acquisition system had the advantages of easy realization, low cost, strong expansibility and simple operation, and it can be widely used in industrial control, mechanical automation, intelligent robot, and so on.

WoS,An advanced artificial intelligence technique for resource allocation by investigating and scheduling parallel-distributed request/response handling,"Cloud computing is an emerging technology undergoing various challenges that integrate parallel and distributed computing together. In the multi-tenant environment cloud applications can be utilized as a service. User request are enormous and therefore the attributes to be concerned about are scalability, reliability, and resource availability and server response. Utilization of software, platform and infrastructure increases in this environment paving way for resource consumption. This scenario arises various types of issues through collision, traffic jam, data loss, request dropout and delay in response. The past research provides solutions for aspects like scalability, resource allocation, scheduling, load balancing and optimized request and response handling, resource management through virtualization. The process of virtualization and migration of environment is difficult. The cost for allocating VM for a single user is less. The paper proposed a novel scheduling approach for handling unlimited incoming request with quality of service through energy and throughput. The allocated resource focus on maintaining incoming job request, request for dispatch to the server and an acknowledgement for the receipt of response. The paper provides resource allocation methodology through scheduling approaches called integrating of AI techniques namely Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

WoS,The Effect of Multimodal Emotional Expression on Responses to a Digital Human during a Self-Disclosure Conversation: a Computational Analysis of User Language,"Digital humans show promise for use in healthcare as virtual therapists to deliver psychotherapy or companions for social support. For digital humans to be effective and engaging in these roles, it is important they can build close relationships with people. Emotional expressiveness can improve social closeness in human relationships, especially for females. However, it is unknown whether multimodal emotional expression improves relationships with digital humans. Participants were 185 adults aged 18 years or older with English fluency. Participants were block-randomized by gender to complete the Relationship Closeness Induction Task with one of six versions of a digital human. The digital humans varied in modality richness (face, no face) and emotional expression (emotional voice, neutral voice; emotional face, neutral face). Participants' language was analysed for emotional content using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software. A series of three-way ANOVA and ANCOVA were conducted to evaluate the effect of digital human face type, voice type, and participant gender on emotional content in participant language. A digital human with no face was associated with more first-person singular pronoun use than a neutral face and an emotional face digital human. A digital human with no face and a neutral voice received more general negative emotion language than a digital human with no face and an emotional voice. Findings suggest the presence of a face and emotion in the voice may improve emotional responses to digital humans.

WoS,Development and validation of a PIV processing routine for two-phase index-matched flows,"Implementing particle image velocimetry (PIV) in particle-laden flows is a challenging task due to the optical effects of the added particles. The addition of particles reduces optical access in the measurement region, degrades image quality and increases the experimental uncertainty. One method for reducing this effect is by using refractive index matching (RIM) which matches the index of refraction of the fluid and added particles rendering the particles optically transparent. Exact matching of the refractive index is difficult to achieve in practice. Even slight mismatches in the refractive indices lead to degradation of the image quality which will impact the higher-order statistics. Comparisons of statistics between loading levels are difficult under these conditions. In this work, the effect of processing methodology on RIM PIV images is investigated. RIM is achieved through the use of superabsorbent hydrogel materials in water. Two processing methods are investigated. The baseline method is a basic PIV correlation process without any pre- or post-processing. The refined process utilizes image pre-processing, data post-processing, and experimental error compensation. The goal for the refined method was to optimize and implement a more sophisticated PIV processing routine using existing commercial software on a particle-laden flow to reduce progressive error artifacts. Images from a fully turbulent channel flow with particle loading levels of 0-15% are utilized. Past literature indicates that turbulence levels will be attenuated for the particles used. Turbulence levels calculated using the baseline method show a linear increase with increasing loading, which is a non-physical result. The refined processing method shows a slight attenuation of turbulence which is consistent with expectations. The study highlights the need for careful processing and interpretation of results in cases where changes in image quality can be expected between different experimental conditions.",Index matching; PIV; Error analysis; Turbulence modulation,"Bluestein, AM; Bohl, D",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF VISUALIZATION,10.1007/s12650-020-00680-9,"[Bluestein, Andrew M.; Bohl, Douglas] Clarkson Univ, Mech & Aeronaut Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA",SPRINGER,English,1343-8875,

WoS,Rapid Posterior Tibial Reduction After Noncontact Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture: Mechanism Description From a Video Analysis,"Background: The mechanisms of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are an enormously debated topic in sports medicine; however, the late phases of injury have not yet been investigated. Hypothesis: A well-defined posterior tibial translation can be visualized with its timing and patterns of knee flexion after ACL injury. Study Design: Case series. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Methods: A total of 137 videos of ACL injuries in professional male football (soccer) players were screened for a sudden posterior tibial reduction (PTR) in the late phase of noncontact ACL injury mechanism. The suitable videos were analyzed using Kinovea software for sport video analysis. The time of initial contact of the foot with the ground, the foot lift, the start of tibial reduction, and the end of tibial reduction were assessed. Results: A total of 21 videos exhibited a clear posterior tibial reduction of 42 +/- 11 ms, after an average of 229 +/- 81 ms after initial contact. The tibial reduction occurred consistently within the first 50 to 60 ms after foot lift (55 +/- 30 ms) and with the knee flexed between 45 degrees and 90 degrees (62%) or more than 90 degrees (24%).

WoS,"Evaluation of HealthPathways: an appraisal of usage, experiences and opinions of healthcare professionals in Australia and New Zealand","Objectives HealthPathways, pioneered in Canterbury, New Zealand, in 2008, is a web-based tool designed to promote health care integration and patient management in primary care and to reduce fragmentation in the delivery of health services. This cross-sectional study evaluated the utilisation and perceptions of this tool among health professionals in Australia and New Zealand. Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered online through Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses and managers, nurse practitioners, specialist and community nurses, hospital clinicians, nurses, managers, and allied health professionals between April and September 2018. The frequency of HealthPathways use in the previous month was modelled as an ordered response using an ordered logistic regression model after adjusting for the possible effects of sex, age, years in clinical practice, location and time spent in practice. Results Health professionals perceived HealthPathways to be useful in primary care management and referral, as well as in the prereferral treatment of patients. GPs in New Zealand, New South Wales and Victoria were 73%, 47% and 27% more likely to have used HealthPathways >= 10 times in the previous month respectively. Conclusion The results suggest that HealthPathways is having a positive effect on healthcare systems in New Zealand and Australia. However, differences in uptake suggests the need for focused implementation, integration into eReferral software and expanding the tool to medical students, registrars, allied health professionals and potentially patients to encourage behavioural change. What is known about the topic? Early evaluations suggest that HealthPathways is a useful tool for health professionals, although uptake and utilisation may be limited. However, there is no comparative evidence regarding uptake and implementation of the tool. What does the paper add? This study is among the first to provide a comparative narrative of the literature assessing the implementation and uptake of HealthPathways across Australia and New Zealand. It is also among the first to compare the perceptions of allied health professionals in the use of HealthPathways across Australia and New Zealand. What are the implications for practitioners?

WoS,Security anomaly detection in software-defined networking based on a prediction technique,"Nowadays, software-defined networking (SDN) is regarded as the best solution for the centralized handling and monitoring of large networks. However, it should be noted that SDN architecture suffers from the same security issues, which are the case with common networks. As a case in point, one of the shortcomings of SDNs is related to its high vulnerability to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and other similar ones. Indeed, anomaly detection systems have been considered to deal with these attacks. The challenges are related to designing these systems including gathering data, extracting effective features, and selecting the best model for anomaly detection. In this paper, a novel combined approach is proposed; this method uses NetFlow protocol for gathering information and generating dataset, information gain ratio (IGR), in order to select the effective and relevant features and ensemble learning scheme (Stacking) for developing a structure with desirable performance and efficiency for detecting anomaly in SDN environment. The results obtained from the experiments revealed that the proposed method performs better than other methods in terms of enhancing accuracy (AC) and detection rate (DR) and reducing classification error (CE) and false alarm rate (FAR). The AC, DR, CE, and FAR of the proposed model were measured as 99.92%, 99.83%, 0.08%, and 0.03%, respectively.

WoS,"One species hides many: Molecular and morphological evidence for cryptic speciation in a thread snake (Leptotyphlopidae:Leptotyphlops sylvicolusBroadley & Wallach, 1997)","We investigate the phylogeographic structure of a fossorial forest-living snake species, the forest thread snake,LeptotyphlopssylvicolusBroadley & Wallach, 1997 by sampling specimens from the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. Phylogenetic results, using Bayesian inferences and maximum likelihood, from the combined mitochondrial sequence data (cyt bandND4), along with population genetic analyses suggest the presence of phylogeographic breaks broadly congruent to those exhibited by other forest-living taxa. Divergence-time estimates indicate that cladogenesis within the study taxon occurred during the late Miocene climatic shifts, suggesting that cladogenesis was driven by habitat fragmentation. We further investigate the species-level divergence withinL. sylvicolusby including two partial nuclear loci (PRLRandRAG1). The three species delimitation methods (ABGD, bGMYC, and STACEY), retrieved 10-12 putative species nested within theL. sylvicolusspecies complex. These results were corroborated by iBPP implementing molecular and morphological data in an integrative Bayesian framework. The morphological analyses exhibit large overlap among putative species but indicate differences between grassland and forest species. Due to the narrow distributions of these putative species, the results of the present study have further implications for the conservation status of theL. sylvicolusspecies complex and suggest that forest and grassland habitats along the east coast of South Africa may harbor significantly higher levels of diversity than currently recognized.",cladogenesis; climatic oscillations; conservative morphology; forest biogeographic breaks; fossorial snakes,"Busschau, T; Conradie, W; Daniels, SR",2020.0,ReviewEA,JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,10.1111/jzs.12401,"[Busschau, Theo; Daniels, Savel R.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Conradie, Werner] Port Elizabeth Museum, Humewood, South Africa; [Conradie, Werner] Nelson Mandela Univ, Sch Nat Resource Management, George Campus, George, South Africa",WILEY,English,0947-5745,
WoS,Antimicrobial stewardship in remote primary healthcare across northern Australia,"Background: The high burden of infectious disease and associated antimicrobial use likely contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in remote Australian Aboriginal communities. We aimed to develop and apply context-specific tools to audit antimicrobial use in the remote primary healthcare setting. Methods: We adapted the General Practice version of the National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey (GP NAPS) tool to audit antimicrobial use over 2-3 weeks in 15 remote primary healthcare clinics across the Kimberley region of Western Australia (03/2018-06/2018), Top End of the Northern Territory (08/2017-09/2017) and far north Queensland (05/2018-06/2018). At each clinic we reviewed consecutive clinic presentations until 30 presentations where antimicrobials had been used were included in the audit. Data recorded included the antimicrobials used, indications and treating health professional. We assessed the appropriateness of antimicrobial use and functionality of the tool. Results: We audited the use of 668 antimicrobials. Skin and soft tissue infections were the dominant treatment indications (WA: 35%; NT: 29%; QLD: 40%). Compared with other settings in Australia, narrow spectrum antimicrobials like benzathine benzylpenicillin were commonly given and the appropriateness of use was high (WA: 91%; NT: 82%; QLD: 65%). While the audit was informative, non-integration with practice software made the process manually intensive. Conclusions: Patterns of antimicrobial use in remote primary care are different from other settings in Australia.

Forty-seven feet in 44 patients had weight-bearing CT and MRI studies performed on the same day. Materials and methods Hindfoot alignment on MRI was assessed by two radiologists who calculated tibiocalcaneal angle (TCA) and calcaneofibular ligament angle (CFLA). On WB-CT, foot ankle offset (FAO), calcaneal offset (CO) and hindfoot angle (HA) were assessed by a senior Foot and Ankle Surgeon using dedicated software. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between these measurements. Results The study group comprised 27 males and 17 females with a mean age of 45 years (range 13-79 years). A statistically significant positive correlation was identified between TCA on MRI and all measurements of hindfoot alignment on WB-CT (p = 0.001-0.005). The CFLA on MRI only had significant correlation with CO on WB-CT (p = 0.03). A significant negative correlation was observed between both MRI parameters (p < 0.001).

WoS,Creating effective interrupted time series graphs: Review and recommendations,"Introduction Interrupted Time Series (ITS) studies may be used to assess the impact of an interruption, such as an intervention or exposure. The data from such studies are particularly amenable to visual display and, when clearly depicted, can readily show the short- and long-term impact of an interruption. Further, well-constructed graphs allow data to be extracted using digitizing software, which can facilitate their inclusion in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Aim We provide recommendations for graphing ITS data, examine the properties of plots presented in ITS studies, and provide examples employing our recommendations. Methods and results Graphing recommendations from seminal data visualization resources were adapted for use with ITS studies. The adapted recommendations cover plotting of data points, trend lines, interruptions, additional lines and general graph components. We assessed whether 217 graphs from recently published (2013-2017) ITS studies met our recommendations and found that 130 graphs (60%) had clearly distinct data points, 100 (46%) had trend lines, and 161 (74%) had a clearly defined interruption. Accurate data extraction (requiring distinct points that align with axis tick marks and labels that allow the points to be interpreted) was possible in only 72 (33%) graphs. Conclusion We found that many ITS graphs did not meet our recommendations and could be improved with simple changes.

WoS,Parametric analysis and optimization of an open-core type three-phaseSISFCL,"Short-circuit faults are the most commonly occurring faults in an electrical power system. Traditionally, circuit breakers, fuses or similar protective devices are used to safeguard sensitive equipment from these faults by disconnecting the supply. An alternative approach for protection against short-circuit faults is using fault current limiters (FCL), which suppress the large magnitude currents created by the fault to manageable values. This fault limiting action not only prevents damage to delicate equipment but also aids in providing uninterrupted power supply to the consumers. A promising FCL design is the saturated iron-core superconducting fault current limiter (SISFCL), which uses the property of its ferromagnetic core to suppress high-magnitude currents. In this paper, the performance of an open-core type three-phase SISFCL is analysed in response to variation of three model parameters. The parametric analysis is performed on the SISFCL under the effects of a symmetric-type three line to ground (LLLG) fault and an asymmetric-type single line to ground (SLG) fault. A finite-element modelling (FEM) approach is used in the design and simulation of the model in ANSYS Maxwell software. Following the parametric analysis, an optimization of the design of the SISFCL is performed using the Quasi-Newton Gradient Search method, in order to improve its performance against both LLLG and SLG faults.",fault current limiter; open core type; optimization; parametric analysis; short-circuit fault; SISFCL,"Upadhyaya, A; Roy, D; Choudhury, AB; Yamada, S",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS,10.1002/2050-7038.12534,"[Upadhyaya, Anirban; Roy, Debabrata; Choudhury, Amalendu B.] Indian Inst Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Howrah 711103, W Bengal, India; [Yamada, Sotoshi] Kanazawa Univ, Inst Nat & Environm Technol K INET, Div Biol Measurement & Applicat, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan",WILEY,English,2050-7038,
WoS,"Consistency of the activity-composition models of Holland, Green, and Powell (2018) with experiments on natural and synthetic compositions: A comparative study","The recent publication of new activity-composition models by Holland, Green and Powell (2018;Journal of Petrology59: 881-900), with a melt model calibrated for source compositions ranging from peridotitic to granitic, opens the door to the modelling of multiple petrogenetic processes at supersolidus conditions in which the composition of the melt phase changes considerably, without having to change the melt model. This melt model is also the first one using the internally consistent thermodynamic databases published by T. Holland and R. Powell that contains TiO(2)and Fe2O3, further expanding the application of this model to more realistic geological scenarios. The accompanying mineral models are also the first in containing some minor elements, like TiO(2)in garnet and K2O in clinopyroxene. Consequently, it is relevant to test the applicability of these new models to a largeP-T-Xrange of conditions before they can be used in full. Thermodynamic calculations made with the software Perple_X using these models were compared to experimental results, namely the modal proportions and the composition of the melt and several mineral solution phases. The experiments chosen for the comparative study covered a wide range of source compositions (from mafic to felsic), pressure (from 0.3 to 2.1 GPa), temperature (from 700 to 1,150 degrees C) and total and added water content (structural water: 0.15-1.48 wt%; added water: 0-8 wt%; total water: 0.15%-8.15%). The results indicate that the extended melt model reproduces well the composition of the experimental melts, with an inverse correlation between component amount and fit: the best match is found for SiO2(-0.8% on average) and the worst match is found for those elements with the lowest amounts, TiO(2)and MgO (+241% and +235% on average, respectively; values indicate calculated minus experimental, times 100 and divided by experimental). The TiO(2)content in the melt model increases dramatically with increasing pressure, from +90% forP P > 1.5 GPa. No comparison was made on the Fe(2)O(3)content, as the published iron contents of the experimental melts were always reported as FeOt. In some cases, there is a substantial mismatch in the modal proportions between experiments and calculations, with the reactant phases less abundant and product phases more abundant in the calculations, an effect that is attributed to kinetic effects in the experiments and to the selected clinoamphibole model. Finally, the extended melt model was compared to the tonalitic melt model of Green et al. (2016;Journal of Metamorphic Geology,34: 845-869). Both melt models produce very similar results for SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O and K2O, with slightly better results for the tonalitic melt model in FeO(t)and MgO and for the extended melt model in CaO. No comparison is made on TiO(2)because the tonalitic melt model does not include this component. In summary, the new activity-composition models represent a significant contribution to thermodynamic calculations on the evolution of siliceous magmas where their composition, temperature and pressure changes substantially.",computational petrology; experimental petrology; extended melt model; Perple_X; thermodynamic calculations,"Garcia-Arias, M",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF METAMORPHIC GEOLOGY,10.1111/jmg.12557,"[Garcia-Arias, Marcos] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ciencias, Dept Geociencias, Carrera 1 18A-2, Bogota 110711, Colombia",WILEY,English,0263-4929,
WoS,To couple or not to couple A case study of institutional legitimacy relating to SaaS applications in two universities,"Purpose The predominant narrative is that contemporary organisations, motivated by economic-rationalist aspirations, adopt cloud applications on the premise of achieving cost-savings and efficiency gains. However, how they actually adopt and rollover such new or emerging technologies may be influenced by acts, patterns and processes of institutional legitimacy. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the dynamics surrounding decisions on how specific cloud applications are adopted from the context of institutional theory, with a particular focus on the concepts of coupling and decoupling. Design/methodology/approach To examine this phenomenon, two qualitative case studies, using a reflexive research approach, of an Australian and a Swedish university have been undertaken, both of which adopted commercial cloud applications for e.g. e-mail, collaboration and storage (as examples of software as a service) at different points in time. One of the universities was known for its early adoption of cloud applications, but had decelerated further deployment of such services, while the other, despite its conservative reputation, has made rapid strides in this regard. Findings The findings of the dual case studies reveal that organisations, contrary to economic-rationalist claims, may or may not decide to adopt particular commercial cloud-based offerings for the support of core operations, on the basis of how they perceive their institutional legitimacy being affected by a complex network of influential actors, both internally and in the external spaces. Therefore, this paper offers an institutional theory-based discourse and rich illustrations on how the role of technology is played out in enhancing relationships between an organisation and such actors in terms of legitimacy focusing acts of coupling and decoupling. Originality/value In the analysis and findings the authors, in a novel way, illustrate how organisations strive for: institutional legitimacy through acts of coupling, and the revelations of consequential decoupling.

WoS,Post-disaster permanent housing: the case of the 2003 Bingol earthquake in Turkey,"Purpose In this study, the effects of permanent housing (PH) practices carried out after an earthquake in Turkey were investigated with a case study. Determining the factors that increase occupants' satisfaction at the local level and transferring them to the projects to be conducted were aimed. Design/methodology/approach The data obtained with questionnaires, statistical analyses, drawings and area examinations belonging to the PH areas built after the 2003 Bingol earthquake were based on a complementary qualitative research study. Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were used in the analysis of the data. In the CFA, various fits or conformity indices were used to determine to what extent the suggested models showed compliance with the data. SPSS and AMOS were preferred as analysis software. Findings When the findings were examined, it was observed that there are significant deficiencies in the activities regarding planning and carrying out the PH production process after the 2003 Bingol earthquake. An analysis to determine success factors revealed that the most important factor affecting satisfaction is housing environment. In addition, the factors housing design, economic recovery, cooperation, built quality and social effect were determined as important elements for successful results. Research limitations/implications The most important way to reduce the destructive effects of disasters is to develop correct solutions. Therefore, it is of great importance to conduct research in an earthquake-affected region, to examine the performance of the produced environments, to present the existing problems and to determine the satisfaction of the users in the new housing and their environment.

WoS,Larmor Precession: Observation and Utilization for Boosting the Signal Intensity of Radio Frequency Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry,"A novel magnet array system was constructed to use Larmor precession for boosting the signal intensity of rf-GD-MS. The enhancement mechanism with four magnet array devices of a single-block magnet and 2 X 2, 3 X 2, and 3 X 4 magnet arrays was simulated and studied by COMSOL Multiphysics Software 5.4.0 (COMSOL) to determine if the electrons in the discharge plasma could perform Larmor precession along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. Induced by Larmor precession, inelastic collisions between the primary electrons and the sample produced numerous secondary electrons and further improved the ionization efficiency. Moreover, the fuzzy synthetic evaluation result predicted that the device with a 3X 2 magnet array would display the greatest enhancement effect among the four devices. On the basis of these theoretical studies, a magnet array system with four magnet array devices was fabricated and utilized for studies of two scintillation crystals BGO and PWO. The observations indicated that the signal intensities obtained for Bi-209 and Pb-208 with the magnet array system were 630-3600 times of that obtained without a magnet and were enhanced by a factor of 1.5-2.8 compared with a previously reported stacked magnetic device. Two NIST samples were used to validate the method, and the results suggested that relative errors were less than 10%, and the lowest detection limit for the 3 X 2 magnet array could reach 0.0032 mu g.g(-1).

This study, using Malmquist data envelopment analysis (DEA), aims to assess in the level of operational and financial efficiency and its determinants for ensuring and sustaining excellent performance in 33 Egyptian private hospitals. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a Malmquist DEA approach to assess the changes in operational and financial efficiency in Egyptian hospitals. Tobit regression was also used to identify the significant variables affecting their efficiency. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out for model validations. Findings Out of 33 hospitals, 17 were found inefficient due to the decline in their technical efficiency. Moreover, the total value of the software programs and operational expenses and the total number of employees are common factors affecting both operational and financial efficiency. In addition, the number of physicians significantly affects the hospital's financial efficiency. Practical implications The study sheds light on the value of using DEA to assess efficiency.

WoS,Future temporal focus in resilience research: when leader resilience provides a role model,"Purpose Despite more and more researchers recommend that time-related issues should be considered into the resilience research, temporal issue is still largely neglected in empirical domain. The purpose of this study is to introduce the concept of future temporal focus, while investigating whether and when leader resilience contributes to subordinates' level of conveyed resilience. Design/methodology/approach Survey responses from a two-source field study involving 222 supervisor-subordinate dyads were collected. Regression-based moderation and bootstrapping analyses were adapted to analyze data and test hypotheses by using the PROCESS syntax in SPSS software. Findings Results showed that there is no significant effect of leader resilience on subordinate resilience. However, consistent with hypotheses, leader's future temporal focus and resilience had a significant interactive effect on subordinate's resilience. That is, when leaders had higher level of future temporal focus, their resilience would be positively correlated with subordinate resilience. Practical implications The findings of the study provide important practical insights into developing relevant training and intervention programs in organizations to cultivate employee resilience. These can also be strengthened by encouraging leaders' future-oriented cognition on work-related domains and leader-member exchange relationship.

WoS,245 ps-TOF brain-dedicated PET prototype with a hemispherical detector arrangement,"Brain PET, which has led research in molecular imaging and diagnosis of brain cancer, epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders, is being spotlighted again to promote earlier diagnosis of dementia with the advent of amyloid and tau tracers. To meet this demand, in this paper, we developed a brain-dedicated PET imaging device with a hemispherical detector arrangement, which provides comparable sensitivity with fewer detectors than conventional cylindrical geometries. The introduction of the time-of-flight (TOF) measurement capability was a key point for the development to get a gain in the image signal-to-noise ratio. Currently, whole-body PET scanners with around 200-400 ps coincidence resolving time (CRT) are commercially available. In order to obtain the same TOF gain which can be obtained with 400 ps CRT for a 30 cm diameter object, 267 ps CRT will be required for a 20 cm diameter object such as the human head. In this work, therefore, we aimed at developing a TOF brain-dedicated PET prototype with the hemisphere detector arrangement and the CRT faster than 267 ps. The detector was composed of a 12 x 12 lutetium fine silicate (LFS) array coupled with a 12 x 12 multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) array. Each LFS crystal with a size of 4.14 x 4.14 x 10 mm(3)was individually coupled to a separate MPPC. Singles list-mode data from each detector were stored, and coincidences were identified using a coincidence-detection software algorithm. The CRT of 245 ps was finally achieved as the system average after a fine timing correction. For image reconstruction, we implemented the list-mode TOF-OSEM. For a small rod phantom, rods of 3 mm diameter were clearly separated. Also, images of the 3D Hoffman brain phantom, which demonstrated clear contrast between gray and white matter, supported the effect of TOF information.",brain PET; TOF; detector,"Yoshida, E; Tashima, H; Akamatsu, G; Iwao, Y; Takahashi, M; Yamashita, T; Yamaya, T",2020.0,Journal,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,10.1088/1361-6560/ab8c91,"[Yoshida, Eiji; Tashima, Hideaki; Akamatsu, Go; Iwao, Yuma; Takahashi, Miwako; Yamaya, Taiga] Natl Inst Quantum & Radiol Sci & Technol, Natl Inst Radiol Sci, Chiba, Japan; [Yamashita, Taichi] ATOX Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan",IOP PUBLISHING LTD,English,0031-9155,
WoS,Pseudo-RNA-Binding Domains Mediate RNA Structure Specificity in Upstream of N-Ras,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) commonly feature multiple RNA-binding domains (RBDs), which provide these proteins with a modular architecture. Accumulating evidence supports that RBP architectural modularity and adaptability define the specificity of their interactions with RNA. However, how multiple RBDs recognize their cognate single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequences in concert remains poorly understood. Here, we use Upstream of N-Ras (Unr) as a model system to address this question. Although reported to contain five ssRNA-binding cold-shock domains (CSDs), we demonstrate that Unr includes an additional four CSDs that do not bind RNA (pseudo-RBDs) but are involved in mediating RNA tertiary structure specificity by reducing the conformational heterogeneity of Unr. Disrupting the interactions between canonical and non-canonical CSDs impacts RNA binding, Unr-mediated translation regulation, and the Unr-dependent RNA interactome. Taken together, our studies reveal a new paradigm in protein-RNA recognition, where interactions between RBDs and pseudo-RBDs select RNA tertiary structures, influence RNP assembly, and define target specificity.",,"Hollmann, NM; Jagtap, PKA; Masiewicz, P; Guitart, T; Simon, B; Provaznik, J; Stein, F; Haberkant, P; Sweetapple, LJ; Villacorta, L; Mooijman, D; Benes, V; Savitski, MM; Gebauer, F; Hennig, J",2020.0,Journal,CELL REPORTS,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107930,"[Hollmann, Nele Merret; Jagtap, Pravin Kumar Ankush; Masiewicz, Pawel; Simon, Bernd; Sweetapple, Lara Jayne; Hennig, Janosch] EMBL Heidelberg, Struct & Computat Biol Unit, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Hollmann, Nele Merret] Collaborat Joint PhD Degree EMBL & Heidelberg Uni, Fac Biosci, Heidelberg, Germany; [Guitart, Tanit; Gebauer, Fatima] Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, Gene Regulat Stem Cells & Canc Programme, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gebauer, Fatima] Univ Pompeu Fabra UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Provaznik, Jan; Villacorta, Laura; Benes, Vladimir] EMBL Heidelberg, Genom Core Facil, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Stein, Frank; Haberkant, Per; Savitski, Mikhail M.] EMBL Heidelberg, Prote Core Facil, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Mooijman, Dylan] EMBL Heidelberg, Dev Biol Unit, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Savitski, Mikhail M.] EMBL Heidelberg, Genome Biol Unit, Meyerhofstr 1, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany",CELL PRESS,English,2211-1247,
WoS,Assessment of wind energy potential for Tuvalu with accurate estimation of Weibull parameters,"Wind resource assessments are carried out for two sites in Tuvalu: Funafuti and Nukufetau. The wind speeds at 34 and 20 m above ground level were recorded for approximately 12 months and analyzed. The averages of each site are computed as the overall, daily, monthly, annual, and seasonal averages. The overall average wind speeds for Funafuti and Nukufetau at 34 m above ground level were estimated to be 6.19 and 5.36 m/s, respectively. The turbulence intensities at the two sites were also analyzed. The turbulence intensity is also computed for windy and low-wind days. Wind shear analysis was carried out and correlated with temperature variation. Ten different methods: median and quartiles method, the empirical method of Lysen, the empirical method of Justus, the moments method, the least squares method, the maximum likelihood method, the modified maximum likelihood method, the energy pattern factor method, method of multi-objective moments, and the wind atlas analysis and application program method were used to find the Weibull parameters. From these methods, the best method is used to determine the wind power density for the site. The wind power density for Funafuti is 228.18 W/m(2)and for Nukufetau is 145.1 W/m(2). The site maps were digitized and with the WAsP software, five potential locations were selected for each site from the wind resource map. The annual energy production for the sites was computed using wind atlas analysis and application program to be 2921.34 and 1848.49 MWh.

WoS,Adaptive robust control for tank stability: A constraint-following approach,"This article addresses a control problem for tank stability based on constraint following. The objective is to design a control to drive the tank stability control system to follow a pre-specified stability constraint approximately: with the consideration of (possibly) time-varying uncertainty (including system modeling error and road excitation), if the barrel deviates from the target angle, drive it to be arbitrarily close to the target angle; and if the barrel points to the target angle, drive it to stay there. This is formulated as a problem of approximate constraint-following control. First, as the model-based control design object, the dynamic equation of the tank stability control system with the system modeling error and the road excitation is obtained. Second, as the control objective, the stability constraint is formulated. Third, as the control strategy, an adaptive robust control is proposed for approximate constraint following. Fourth, as the control object, a virtual prototype model of tank driving on bumpy road is established with multi-body dynamics software RecurDyn. Finally, real-time servo control and target observation of the tank stability system are performed by co-simulation. It shows that the constraint-following error converges quickly to10-4in 1.5 s. By this, the tank stability control system can be always stable even if the tank is driving and disturbed with frequent road excitation.",Mechanical system; tank stability; uncertainty; road excitation; constraint following; adaptive robust control,"Ma, YZ; Yang, GL; Sun, QQ; Wang, XY; Sun, QZ",2020.0,JournalEA,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING,10.1177/0959651820937847,"[Ma, Yuze; Yang, Guolai; Sun, Qinqin; Wang, Xiuye; Sun, Quanzhao] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,English,0959-6518,

In the present paper, the effects of viscoelastic property of drilling fluids on flow through wellbore annulus are studied numerically by use of computational fluid dynamics simulation in OpenFOAM software. This problem is simulated as the flow between two coaxial annulus cylinders and the inner cylinder is rotating through its axes. Here, the Giesekus model is used as the nonlinear constitutive equation. This model brings the nonlinear viscosity, normal stress differences, extensional viscosity and elastic property. The numerical solution is obtained using the second order finite volume method by considering PISO algorithm for pressure correction. The effect of elasticity, Reynolds number, Taylor number and mobility factor on the velocity and stress fields, pressure drop, and important coefficient of drilling mud flow is studied in detail. The results predicted that increasing elastic property of drilling mud lead to an initial sharp drop in the axial pressure gradient as well as Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient.

There are presently three systems-OpenAPS, AndroidAPS and Loop. We present perspectives of two patients, parent of a patient, and their healthcare providers; the users spanning an age spectrum most likely to use this technology-a child, an adolescent in transitional care and a 31-yr old adult patient, highlighting how looping has helped them self-manage diabetes within the routine of their lives and the challenges they faced.",Artificial pancreas systems; Type 1 diabetes; Continuous glucose monitoring; Do-it-yourself (DIY); Insulin pump therapy; Hypoglycaemia; Time-in-range,"Ahmed, SH; Ewins, DL; Bridges, J; Timmis, A; Payne, N; Mooney, C; MacGregor, C",2020.0,JournalEA,ADVANCES IN THERAPY,10.1007/s12325-020-01431-w,"[Ahmed, Syed Haris; Ewins, David L.; Bridges, Jane] Countess Chester Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Endocrinol & Metab Med, Chester, Cheshire, England; [Ahmed, Syed Haris] Univ Liverpool, Sch Med, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Timmis, Alison] Countess Chester Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Childrens & Adolescent Serv, Chester, Cheshire, England; [Payne, Nicola; Mooney, Cormac; MacGregor, Claire] Countess Chester Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Chester, Cheshire, England",SPRINGER,English,0741-238X,
WoS,Restructuring Object-Oriented Software Systems Using Various Aspects of Class Information,"Frequent modifications in a software system generally deteriorate the design of the source code and consequently increase the complexity of the system. In object-oriented software, one of the symptoms of design degradation is that the package structure of the source code drifts away from design principles. To improve the deteriorated design, systems are generally restructured by reorganizing the classes into packages based on good design principles. Coupling and cohesion are the two important package design principles widely used to assess software design quality. Most of the existing package restructuring approaches use either structural, lexical, or change history class information to compute coupling and cohesion of software system. Moreover, these approaches compute coupling and cohesion without considering multiple dimensions of structural, lexical, and change history information. In this article, we utilize different types of structural, lexical and change history class information and integrate them as per their relative importance to compute coupling and cohesion. To automate the restructuring process, we formulate the restructuring problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and solve it by using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The proposed approach is applied to five object-oriented software applications. The obtained restructuring is compared with authoritative restructuring and restructuring suggested by external developers. The obtained restructuring is also compared with some existing multi-objective software restructuring approaches. Overall, findings indicate that the proposed approach can be a good approach to improve the design of software systems whose quality is under suspicion.",Software engineering; Object-oriented systems; Restructuring; Genetic algorithm; Coupling metrics,"Prajapati, A; Parashar, A; Chhabra, JK",2020.0,JournalEA,ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,10.1007/s13369-020-04785-z,"[Prajapati, Amarjeet] JIIT Noida, Comp Engn & IT, Noida, India; [Parashar, Anshu] TIET Patiala, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Patiala, Punjab, India; [Chhabra, Jitender Kumar] NIT Kurukshetra, Comp Engn, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,2193-567X,
WoS,Associations of plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) with long-term cancer-related cognitive impairment in survivors of breast cancer,"Purpose Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) have been implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. This study aimed to investigate the associations of plasma BDNF and rs6265 with cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) at the end of chemotherapy, and with persistent and delayed CRCI up to 24 months post chemotherapy, among survivors of early-stage breast cancer. Methods A multicenter, longitudinal study involving 174 breast cancer patients was conducted. CRCI was assessed using the FACT-Cog (V3) questionnaire and the CANTAB software. Plasma BDNF levels were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at serial time points and genotyping was achieved using Sanger sequencing. The associations of BDNF and rs6265 with CRCI were analyzed using logistic regressions. Results A smaller magnitude of reduction in plasma BDNF between baseline and the end of chemotherapy was correlated with protection from overall subjective CRCI (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79-0.99). Furthermore, patients with higher plasma BDNF levels at the end of chemotherapy had lower odds of developing persistent overall subjective CRCI (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.57-0.97) and persistent CRCI in the functional interference domain (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.39-0.98). BDNF Met allele carriers were protected against subjective CRCI at the end of chemotherapy in the multitasking and memory domains, and against persistent subjective CRCI in the mental acuity and multitasking domains. Conclusion BDNF plasma level or rs6265 genotype information may facilitate the identification of patients at higher risk of long-term CRCI during survivorship and enable the implementation of early intervention strategies that increase BDNF levels.",BDNF; rs6265; Breast cancer; Cancer-related cognitive impairment; Survivorship,"Yap, NY; Tan, NYT; Tan, CJ; Loh, KWJ; Ng, RCH; Ho, HK; Chan, A",2020.0,JournalEA,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT,10.1007/s10549-020-05807-y,"[Yap, Ning Yi; Tan, Nichole Yue Ting; Tan, Chia Jie; Ho, Han Kiat] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Pharm, Singapore, Singapore; [Loh, Kiley Wei-Jen; Ng, Raymond Chee Hui] Natl Canc Ctr Singapore, Div Med Oncol, Singapore, Singapore; [Ng, Raymond Chee Hui] KK Womens & Childrens Hosp, Breast Ctr, Singapore, Singapore; [Chan, Alexandre] Natl Canc Ctr Singapore, Dept Pharm, Singapore, Singapore; [Chan, Alexandre] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Clin Pharm Practice, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",SPRINGER,English,0167-6806,

WoS,"Introducing a Comprehensive Geological and Geotechnical Classification for Urban Planning and Design, A Case Study in Isfahan (Iran)","Combining geological and geotechnical data is quite beneficial for planning and designing urban development projects. Isfahan city is located on Jurassic shale and sandstone and Quaternary deposits. It is important to identify the engineering properties of these rock units and soil layers to distinguish them in construction projects. In this research, all types of rocks and soils in Isfahan city are identified precisely. Besides, the geological properties including their origin, thickness and extent are determined. To analyze the subsurface layers and determine their physical and engineering properties, 23 pits were excavated in various locations and in situ tests were performed. In addition, for comparing, completing and identifying layers in higher depth, geotechnical data of 384 boreholes (which have been drilled in civil projects) were used. After analyzing all data by means of SPSS software, The range and average of the physical and engineering properties of area's soil layers such as density, atterberg limits, uniaxial strength, standard penetration test number, undrained and effective internal friction angle and cohesion, deformation modulus, compressibility, swell coefficients and rock units parameters such as density, point load, slake durability and elastic modulus were separately determined based on laboratory and in situ tests. Finally, a comprehensive geological and geotechnical classification and geotechnical zoning map of Isfahan city are suggested to identify subsurface layers and their engineering characteristics.

WoS,Development of a questionnaire for software development companies for internal assessment of the agile maturity level,"This article published in the journal Gruppe Interaktion Organisation (GIO) presents the development and validation of a questionnaire to determine the agile maturity level of a software company based on the assessment of its employees. Agility has become a major issue for many companies, especially in the software field. The reasons for this can be found in the high volatility of the markets, the worldwide progressing digitalization, the global networking of value chains and the pressure to shorten innovation cycles. These developments can no longer be accommodated by conventional cascading development methods, so that they are increasingly replaced by agile approaches. Agile procedures make it possible to process complex requirements and to react flexibly to changes. Despite their advantages, the implementation of agile principles confronts many companies with major challenges. Decisive for the success of agility is not only the introduction of certain methods and techniques, but especially their perception and subjective evaluation by the employees. In order to capture subjective views and judgments, this article presents a questionnaire that can be filled in by employees and that represents the internally perceived level of agile maturity of the company. Since it can be used across departments and hierarchy levels, it provides a differentiated picture of shared values but also of differences in the workforce. Based on this picture, measures can be designed that further advance the agility of the company. The requirements for the questionnaire were derived from publications on agile maturity models and the Agile Manifesto. Based on this, an item pool of initially 128 items was generated. After interviews with six experts, this pool was reduced to 53 items. In an online survey, these 53 items were answered by 200 people on a 7-point Likert scale. A Principal Component Analysis with Varimax rotation resulted in a five-dimensional version with 26 items that can be used for an internal assessment of the degree of agile maturity. Future work will focus on further optimizing the instrument.",Agile; Scrum; Software development; Self-assessment; Work organization; Maturity model; Questionnaire,"Jungnickel, K; Minge, M; Thuring, M",2020.0,JournalEA,GIO-GRUPPE-INTERAKTION-ORGANISATION-ZEITSCHRIFT FUER ANGEWANDTE ORGANISATIONSPSYCHOLOGIE,10.1007/s11612-020-00522-0,"[Jungnickel, Katharina; Minge, Michael; Thuering, Manfred] Tech Univ Berlin, Fachgebiet Kognit Psychol & Kognit Ergon, Berlin, Germany",SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH,German,2366-6145,
WoS,The Role of Social Capital in Water Reservoirs Governance: Evidence from Northern Iran,"Collective local governance of traditional water reservoirs (Ab-bandans) in Mazandaran province, Northern Iran, is gradually disappearing. Using the concept of social capital, we explore how and why components of social capital (trust, co-operation, social network cohesion, leadership roles, and conflict resolution) among various local stakeholders influence water management through semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with key local stakeholders (29 interviews). We used NVivo software to code the interview transcripts through the identification of relevant themes. Our results indicate that the most important component of social capital for local community water management is conflict resolution. Local community leaders play a crucial role in promoting and facilitating cooperation and conflict resolution among communities through negotiation and conciliation mechanisms. However, these mechanisms have proved inadequate in providing lasting resolution of conflicts between neighbouring communities over water management. Since the Iranian government has overall responsibility for water management, we recommend it engage directly in the resolution of local water conflicts to ensure lasting solutions acceptable to all local stakeholders.",Water management; Local leadership; Social capital; Conflict resolution; Mazandaran province; Northern Iran,"Mirzaei, A; Knierim, A; Nahavand, SF; Shemshad, M",2020.0,JournalEA,HUMAN ECOLOGY,10.1007/s10745-020-00168-y,"[Mirzaei, Arezoo; Knierim, Andrea] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Social Sci Agr, Stuttgart, Germany; [Fealy Nahavand, Saeid] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Agr Extens & Educ Inst, Tehran, Iran; [Shemshad, Masoomeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Agr Extens & Educ Inst, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran",SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,English,0300-7839,

WoS,Overall efficiency improvement of photovoltaic-thermal air collector: numerical and experimental investigation in the desert climate of Ouargla region,"In the Ouargla region, the desert area of Algeria, photovoltaic fields (PV) suffer from hard climate conditions with high-temperature levels. This temperature level causes a significant fall of PV cells efficiency which requires an integrated cooling system. For achieving this purpose, a thermal part based on airflow provided along a straight channel under the PV module (150 W) is added. It extracts the accumulated heat by air natural convection, then, the airflow passes through an upper glass extension (0.56 m) to reinforce the heat collection. The evaluation of the whole system performance is experimentally conducted by performing several variations of operating parameters and air channel depth. This photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) system has modeled by a set of balanced energy equations that are resolved numerically using Matlab software. The experimental results show that the increase in the channel depth causes a significant reduction of thermal efficiency and a slight effect on the electrical one. The numerical data are compared and validated by the experimental results, where the characteristic curves (efficiencies, polarization, powers, temperatures) show good concordance with experimental data. The root means square of percentage deviation (RMSD) is between 1.75% and 16.25%. For a channel depth of 10 cm, the energy and exergy efficiency reach their mean values of 58.5% and 14.7%, respectively.

With the change in gap ratios from 1.05 to 2.10, the rate of heat transfer increased significantly, reaching 2.2% while tangential velocity also increased considerably. At gap ratios of 3.15 and 4.20, the rate of heat transfer increased more gradually, local Nusselt number increased slightly where the influence of convection walls was smaller, and tangential velocity showed a very small increase.

WoS,A Batch Scheduling Model for a Three-stage Hybrid Flowshop Producing Products with Hierarchical Assembly Structures,"This paper addresses a batch scheduling problem for a three-stage hybrid flowshop consisting of a machining stage processing common and unique components on unrelated parallel machines, an assembly stage combining the components into assembled products with complex assembly structures, and a differentiation stage processing the assembled products on dedicated machines to produce different product types. The common components are the same for all products and are processed in batches, while the unique components are dedicated to respective given product types and are processed individually (one-by-one component). The goal is to schedule all the products with different assembly structures to minimize total actual flow time (TAFT) defined as total time interval of components to be processed from their arrival times to their common due date. A non-linear programming model is proposed, where small size problems can be solved optimally using the LINGO software, and large size problems is to be solved using a heuristic algorithm. The proposed algorithm consists of two sub-algorithms. The first one is constructed using a shortest processing time (SPT) based heuristic to get a job sequence as an initial solution and the second one is to improve the initial solution using the variable neighbourhood descent (VND) method with neighbourhood insert and swap move operators. In solving the problem with the algorithm, two scenarios arise, e.g., the same and the different sequences for all stages. A set of hypothetical data is generated for different hierarchical assembly structures to test the model and the algorithm, and the results show that the different sequences for all stages obtain solutions with better performances than the same ones.",Batch scheduling; Hierarchical assembly structures; Three-stage hybrid flowshop; Total actual flow time; Unique and common component,"Maulidya, R; Suprayogi; Wangsaputra, R; Halim, AH",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY,10.14716/ijtech.v11i3.3555,"[Maulidya, Rahmi; Suprayogi; Wangsaputra, Rachmawati; Halim, Abdul Hakim] Inst Teknol Bandung ITB, Fac Ind Technol, Jl Ganesha 10, Bandung 40132, Indonesia","UNIV INDONESIA, FAC ENGINEERING",English,2086-9614,

A comparison of the QSCV characteristics is carried out for the above-mentioned channel materials, revealing a significant reduction in the inversion-mode QSCV characteristics for all the materials due to quantization that results in a decrease in the overall gate-to-channel capacitance and hence increases the threshold voltage of the MOS device.

WoS,Parameterization of mechanistic models from qualitative data using an efficient optimal scaling approach,"Quantitative dynamical models facilitate the understanding of biological processes and the prediction of their dynamics. These models usually comprise unknown parameters, which have to be inferred from experimental data. For quantitative experimental data, there are several methods and software tools available. However, for qualitative data the available approaches are limited and computationally demanding. Here, we consider the optimal scaling method which has been developed in statistics for categorical data and has been applied to dynamical systems. This approach turns qualitative variables into quantitative ones, accounting for constraints on their relation. We derive a reduced formulation for the optimization problem defining the optimal scaling. The reduced formulation possesses the same optimal points as the established formulation but requires less degrees of freedom. Parameter estimation for dynamical models of cellular pathways revealed that the reduced formulation improves the robustness and convergence of optimizers. This resulted in substantially reduced computation times. We implemented the proposed approach in the open-source Python Parameter EStimation TOolbox (pyPESTO) to facilitate reuse and extension.

WoS,"Deformation-induced cordierite breakdown-An example from western Maine, USA","Preservation of partially completed metamorphic reactions in the form of partial pseudomorphs is very important as it provides direct insight onto the reaction mechanism and the phases involved in the reaction. The staurolite and andalusite grade rocks in western Maine, USA, contain cordierite porphyroblasts partly pseudomorphed by coarse-grained muscovite and biotite. The pseudomorphs consist of a cordierite core surrounded by a reaction rim. Modal mineralogy, calculated using the ImageJ processing software based on backscatter images and X-ray compositional maps, reveals that the core consists of cordierite (53.5%), muscovite (22.8%), biotite (9.1%), quartz (1 0.4%), plagioclase (3.1%) and ilmenite/pyrrhotite and apatite (1.1%) whereas the reaction rim consists of cordierite (1.8%), muscovite (51.6%), biotite (30.4%), quartz (4.3%), plagioclase (10%), garnet (1.2%), ilmenite/pyrrhotite and apatite (0.8%). The net effect of the cordierite breakdown reaction is an increase of 226% in muscovite, 334% in biotite and 323% in plagioclase content and a decrease of 97% in cordierite. The reaction involved exchange of components with the matrix requiring addition of H2O, K+, Na+ and Ti4+ and removal of SiO2, Mg2+ and PO43- from the reaction site. PT estimates using the garnet-biotite, Ti-in-biotite, Na-in-cordierite thermometers and the garnet-biotite-muscovite-plagioclase barometer indicate that cordierite breakdown occurred at similar to 550 degrees C and 3.5 kbar. THERMOCALC modelling using the bulk rock composition suggests that cordierite is not stable at these conditions, whereas modelling using a thin section-derived bulk composition indicates that cordierite stability extends to higher pressures, and most likely that the cordierite breakdown was not PT dependent. The incorporation of Na (up to 0.18 a.f.u.) into the cordierite structure has the effect of stabilizing the cordierite under a variety of H2O activity and limiting the role of fluids into destabilizing it. The cordierite cores contain evidence of plastic and brittle deformation in the form of subgrains and microcracks, which facilitated the infiltration of fluids that destabilized cordierite at constant PT conditions by leaching Na and introducing K. New mica growth along these structural heterogeneities suggests that deformation played an important role promoting breakdown of cordierite to muscovite and biotite.",cordierite; deformation; fluids; metamorphic reactions; pseudomorphs,"Sanislav, IV; Abu Sharib, ASAA; de Gromard, RSAQ",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF METAMORPHIC GEOLOGY,10.1111/jmg.12551,"[Sanislav, Ioan V.] James Cook Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Econ Geol Res Unit EGRU, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Abu Sharib, Ahmed S.

WoS,"Determination of groundwater potential and aquifer hydraulic characteristics in Agbor, Nigeria using geo-electric, geophysical well logging and pumping test techniques","Geo-electric, geophysical well logging and pumping test were carried out in Agbor, Nigeria to determine the groundwater potential and hydraulic properties of the aquifer in the study area. Twenty vertical electrical sounding were conducted across the study area using the Schlumberger configuration and the field result were curved matched and iterated using the Win Resist software. A borehole was sank in the study area, where soil cuttings were collected to construct the lithology of the subsurface. Geophysical well logging comprising of electrical conductivity and spontaneous potential logs and pumping test were also carried out in the well. The result of the geo-electric study revealed five to six geo-electric layers which consist of topsoil, lateritic sand, clayey sand, fine sand, medium coarse sand and coarse sand. Analysis of the geo-electric result revealed that the aquifer was located within the fifth and sixth layers at a depth which ranged from 29 to 82 m, while the resistivity of the aquifer ranged from 1741 to 29,395 ohm m. Result of the geophysical logging revealed that the electrical conductivity and total dissolved solid of the groundwater are 253 mu S/cm and 165 mg/L, respectively. These values indicate fresh to moderate mineralization of the subsurface and are within the permissible limit set by the Standard Organization of Nigeria for good quality water. The result of the pumping test which was analysed using the Cooper Jacob method revealed that the transmissivity, specific capacity and storativity of the aquifer are 0.0036 m(2)/min, 0.02 m(3)/m and 0.016, respectively.

WoS,Investigating the Socio in Socio-Technical Development: The Case for Psychological Safety in Agile Information Systems Development,"One constitutional part of project management is the management of teams, their actions, and their social mechanisms. Team processes, behavior, and agile practices used by team members play important parts in the success of projects. To reap benefits from these highly interactive and social-focused practices, team members need to feel safe to speak freely. We propose a model that conceptualizes the effects of psychological safety and (social) agile practices on team performance. The proposed model combines recent research from organizational psychology and agile information systems development to provide a better understanding of the team-level effects. Our findings from three case studies conducted in two large insurance companies and one software development company suggest that social agile practices positively influence psychological safety, transparency, communication, and ultimately productivity.",agile software development; psychological safety; performance; information systems development; project management; social agile practices,"Hennel, P; Rosenkranz, C",2020.0,JournalEA,PROJECT MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,10.1177/8756972820933057,"[Hennel, Phil] Univ Cologne, Informat Syst & Integrated Informat Syst, Cologne, Germany; [Rosenkranz, Christoph] Univ Cologne, Fac Econ Management & Social Sci, Cologne Ctr Informat Syst, Integrated Informat Syst, Cologne, Germany",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,English,8756-9728,
WoS,Fiber-based hysteretic model for simulating strength and stiffness deterioration of steel hollow structural section columns under cyclic loading,"An efficient component model has been developed that captures strength and stiffness deterioration of steel hollow structural section (HSS) columns. The proposed model consists of two fiber-based segments at a member's ends along with an elastic segment in between. The fibers exhibit nonlinear uniaxial stress-strain behavior, which is explicitly defined by uniaxial monotonic tensile and cyclic round coupon tests. The postbuckling behavior of an HSS column is traced through a proposed uniaxial effective stress-strain constitutive formulation, which includes a softening branch in compression and an energy-based deterioration rule to trace the influence of cyclic deterioration in the inelastic cyclic straining. These may be inferred by uniaxial stub-column tests. The component model captures the coupling between the column axial force and flexural demands. Consistent model parameters for a number of steel materials used in the steel construction in North America and Japan are proposed along with the associated model calibration process. The efficiency of the proposed model in predicting the hysteretic behavior of HSS columns is demonstrated by comparisons with physical steel column tests subjected to various loading histories, including representative ones of ratcheting prior to earthquake-induced collapse. The proposed model is implemented in an open-source finite element software for nonlinear response history analysis of frame structures. The effectiveness of the proposed model in simulating dynamic instability of steel frame buildings is demonstrated through nonlinear response simulations of a four-story steel frame building, which was tested at full-scale through collapse.

WoS,Effect of fines on liquefaction resistance of sand,"To evaluate the effect of non-plastic fines on liquefaction resistance of Babolsar sand, a series of undrained static and cyclic triaxial tests alongside a series of numerical analysis were carried out. The cyclic triaxial tests were conducted in stress-controlled conditions with 1 Hz frequency at 0.35 constant cyclic stress ratio for 50 kPa and 0.25 for 100 and 200 kPa confining pressures. The samples contained 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of fine grains. The numerical analysis was performed by a finite difference method, and Finn's constitutive model was applied to investigate the liquefaction resistance of the mixtures. The tests' results showed that the number of cycles leading to liquefaction of a sand-silt mixture decreases after increasing fine-grained percentage. Poorer performance in compression and better performance in tension was observed in this situation. The test outcomes also showed that dominant behavior of the mixtures changes from sand to silt at 20% fines content. It was observed from the test results and the numerical analysis that in low percentages of silt, the behavior of the sand-silt mixture is similar to those of the clean sand sample. But by increasing silt, the mixture's behavior becomes more dependent on contacts between fine and granular particles. The concept presented by Thevanayagam was used to check the contacts between fine and coarse particles. It was also observed that the Finn constitutive model is in good consistency with the test results as long as the behavior of the sand is dominant in the mixture.",Liquefaction; Babolsar sand; Firoozkooh silt; Cyclic triaxial test; Static triaxial test; FLAC software,"Choobbasti, AJ; Selatahneh, H; Petanlar, MK",2020.0,Journal,INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS,10.1007/s41062-020-00338-3,"[Janalizadeh Choobbasti, Asskar; Karimi Petanlar, Mehrdad] Babol Noshirvani Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Babol Sar, Iran; [Selatahneh, Hediyeh] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Dept Civil Water & Environm Engn, Tehran, Iran",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,English,2364-4176,
WoS,A fuzzy multicriteria decision-making-based CH selection and hybrid routing protocol for WSN,"One of the famous approaches to decision making is named as multicriteria decision making (MCDM). In order to solve the MCDM issues, a better way is provided by the fuzzy logic. Expendability, cost, maintenance, availability of software, and performance characteristics are such problems considered by the decision. The precise estimation of the pertinent data is one of the vital phases in DM systems. This paper presents a fuzzy MCDM-based cluster head (CH) selection and hybrid routing protocol to solve the most common issues. In this research article, the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (GIFSS) approach is utilized to select the optimal CH, and hybrid shark smell optimization (SSO), and a genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced for the effective routing. Initially, the wireless sensor network (WSN) system and energy models are designed, and then the nodes are grouped into several clusters. Next, based on the GIFSS, the CH nodes are selected, and finally, an effective routing is placed based on the hybrid optimizations. The implementation is performed on the NS2 platform, and the performances are evaluated by packet delivery ratio (PDR), delay, packet loss ratio (PLR), network lifetime, bit error rate (BER), energy consumption, throughput, and jitter. The existing approaches named energy centers examining using particle swarm optimization (EC-PSO), variable dimension-based PSO (VD-PSO), energy-efficient PSO-based CH selection (PSO-ECHS), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-sugeno fuzzy (LEACH-SF), SSO, and GA are compared with the proposed strategy.

WoS,Hierarchical Models for the Analysis of Likert Scales in Regression and Item Response Analysis,"Appropriate modelling of Likert-type items should account for the scale level and the specific role of the neutral middle category, which is present in most Likert-type items that are in common use. Powerful hierarchical models that account for both aspects are proposed. To avoid biased estimates, the models separate the neutral category when modelling the effects of explanatory variables on the outcome. The main model that is propagated uses binary response models as building blocks in a hierarchical way. It has the advantage that it can be easily extended to include response style effects and non-linear smooth effects of explanatory variables. By simple transformation of the data, available software for binary response variables can be used to fit the model. The proposed hierarchical model can be used to investigate the effects of covariates on single Likert-type items and also for the analysis of a combination of items. For both cases, estimation tools are provided.

WoS,Internal FixationversusHemiarthroplasty in the Treatment of Unstable Intertrochanteric Fractures in the Elderly: A Systematic Review andMeta-Analysis,"Objective To evaluate the clinical efficacy of internal fixationversushemiarthroplasty in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. Methods A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to April 2020. The present study compared internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. RevMan5.3 software provided by the International Cochrane Group was used for the meta-analysis. To compare the differences in the operation time, intraoperative bleeding, length of hospital stay, superficial infection, Harris hip score, mortality within 1 year, mortality within 2 years, reoperation, incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), partial weight-bearing time, non-union, and implant-related complications between an internal fixation group and an hemiarthroplasty group. Results A total of 1300 patients were included in nine studies. The results showed that the operation time (MD= -18.09, 95%CI: -27.85--8.34,P= 0.0003), intraoperative bleeding (MD= -195.31, 95%CI: -244.8--147.74,P < 0.0001), implant-related complications (MD= 3.83, 95%CI: 1.74-8.45,P= 0.0008), and partial weight-bearing time (MD= 17.21, 95%CI: 1.63-32.79,P= 0.03) have statistical significance. However, there is not statistical significance for the Harris hip joint function scale (HHS) (MD= 5.60, 95%CI: -1.13-12.33,P= 0.10), DVT (MD= 1.02, 95%CI: 0.45-2.27,P= 0.97), length of hospital stay (MD= -1.08, 95%CI: -2.82-0.66,P= 0.22), superficial Infection (OR= 0.92, 95%CI: 0.43-1.98,P= 0.89), mortality within 1 year (OR= 0.95, 95%CI: 0.61-1.48,P= 0.81), mortality within 2 years (OR= 0.93, 95%CI: 0.61-1.43,P= 0.75), reoperation (MD= 1.80, 95%CI: 0.64-5.04,P= 0.26), and non-union (OR= 1.20, 95%CI: 0.48-3.03,P= 0.70). The result of the subgroup analysis showed no significant differences between the less than 2 years follow-up and the 2 years or more follow-up group. The only difference was for the Harris hip score: the internal fixation group was superior to the hemiarthroplasty group in the less than 2 years subgroup analysis, while there was no difference between the internal fixation group hemiarthroplasty group in the 2 years or more subgroup analysis. Conclusion Compared with the internal fixation group, those in the hemiarthroplasty group could carry out weight-bearing training early and implant-related complications were reduced, but it requires longer operation time and there is greater intraoperative blood loss. There is no difference in mortality, the incidence of DVT, non-union, HHS, reoperation, length of hospital stay, and superficial infection.

WoS,Prognostic Role of Tumor Budding in Carcinoma Tongue: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Introduction Tumor budding is defined as a cluster of cells that invade the stroma. This has recently been studied to be associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and poor overall survival (OS) rate. The reliability and reproducibility of this histopathological feature make it a valid prognostic indicator in tongue carcinomas, which often have an unpredictable prognosis. The objective of this study was to group the studies that elucidate the prognostic role of tumor budding in tongue cancers. Methods A systematic database search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar for relevant studies that reported tumor budding in tongue cancer. The relevant articles were independently screened by two authors for selection and data extraction. As a result, a list of such studies, clinical trials, and references, published in English up to March 2020, was obtained, and a total of 1448 patients in nine studies were included in this meta-analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using RevMan software 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen). Results A higher tumor budding score was significantly correlated with LNM (hazard ratio (HR): 3.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.08-4.52; p <=.00001) and poor OS (HR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.84-3.14; p <=.00001) in tongue cancer. Conclusions Our present study demonstrates that tumor budding is an independent predictor of LNM and OS in tongue cancer.

WoS,A Retrospective Analysis of Hospital Electrocardiogram Auto-Populated QT Interval Calculation,"Background The current electrocardiogram (ECG) standard for rate correction of the QT interval (QTc) is a power function known as the Bazett formula (QTcB). QTc formulae are either power functions or linear functions. QTcB is known to lack reliability, as heart rate (HR) rises from or falls below 60 beats per minute (bpm). The American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) have recommended using other formulae in place of QTcB since 2009. The Epic Electronic Health Record System (Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI) automatically populates the Fridericia formula (QTcFri) on hospital ECG reports without any provider calculation. Methods We aimed to retrospectively investigate the effect of QTcFri on one year of ECGs in the Epic Electronic Health Record (EHR) at a single tertiary care center. Inclusion criteria for ECG reports specified HR 60-120 bpm without QRS duration > 120 ms. Gathered data from Epic EHR ECG reports included patient age, sex, HR, ORS duration (QRSd), OT interval, QTcB, and QTcFri. EHR documented 61,946 ECG reports for the year, with 44,566 meeting criteria for inclusion. General statistical methods included range, median, mean, and standard deviation. Confidence intervals were assessed to maintain the fidelity of analysis. The normality of data distribution was assessed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was then performed to confirm a statistically significant difference between the Bazett and Fridericia formulae. The Delta QTc analysis was conducted on prolonged QTc (males > 450 ms; females > 460 ms) and severely prolonged QTc > 500 ms data subsets. A value of p<0.05 was interpreted as significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software (IBM Statistics, v. 26; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Results The 44,566 ECG reports demonstrated 57% female gender and a mean age of 57 +/- 17.5 years. The mean HR was 83 +/- 14.7 bpm and the mean Delta QTc was 23 +/- 12.9 ms shorter with QTcFri. Mean data showed minimal variation between sexes: age, heart rate, uncorrected QT, QTcB, QTcFri, and Delta QTc varied by less than 2%. Mean ORS varied by 4% between sexes. The Wilcoxon ranksum test revealed 44,127 ranks with a negative difference, 0 ranks with a positive difference, and 439 ties, p <0.001 (99% CI: 22.5 ms, 23.0 ms). QTcB identified 37.4% (16665/44566) ECGs prolonged. Using QTcFri, 21% (9371/44566) of the total ECGs corrected to normal QTc (<450 ms (men) and 460 ms (women)). QTcFri use reduced the number of ECG reports with QTc > 500 ms by 57.3%. A total of 125 ECG reports, 117 females and eight males, corrected to normal gender-specific QTc with QTcFri. The mean decrease in QTc with the Fridericia formula when QTcB > 500 ms was 31 +/- 14.5 ms (99% CI: 30.4 ms, 31.7 ms). Conclusion Our data from the Wilcoxon rank-sum analysis indicated that the EHR QTcFri analysis yields a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) in QTc calculation of 22 ms over 44,566 ECG reports. The data showed a 21% reduction in inaccurately documented test results. The utilization of this resource will provide the most accurate and clinically relevant data to inform clinical decision-making. Accurate QT interval calculation will better inform downstream clinical decision-making through a wider scope of therapeutic intervention. This analysis is readily available to clinicians without calculation and its awareness will benefit patient care.",qt interval; qt calculation; 12-lead; electrocardiogram (ecg/ekg); torsades de pointes (tdp),"Rosenblum, AL; Dremonas, AC; Stockholm, SC; Biondi, NL",2020.0,Journal,CUREUS,10.7759/cureus.9317,"[Rosenblum, Adam L.; Dremonas, Ariana C.; Stockholm, Scott C.; Biondi, Nicholas L.] Cape Fear Valley Hlth Syst, Internal Med, Fayetteville, NC 28304 USA; [Rosenblum, Adam L.; Dremonas, Ariana C.; Stockholm, Scott C.] Campbell Univ, Sch Osteopath Med, Internal Med, Buies Creek, NC 27506 USA",CUREUS INC,English,,
WoS,Identification of key genes of human bone marrow stromal cells adipogenesis at an early stage,"Background: Bone marrow adipocyte (BMA), closely associated with bone degeneration, shares common progenitors with osteoblastic lineage. However, the intrinsic mechanism of cells fate commitment between BMA and osteogenic lineage remains unclear. Methods: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE107789 publicly available was downloaded and analyzed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using GEO2R. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were conducted by The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and Gene set enrichment analysis software. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) network was obtained using STRING database, visualized and clustered by Cytoscape software. Transcriptional levels of key genes were verified by real-time quantitative PCR in vitro in Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) undergoing adipogenic differentiation at day 7 and in vivo in ovariectomized mice model. Results: A total of 2,869 DEGs, including 1,357 up-regulated and 1,512 down-regulated ones, were screened out from transcriptional profile of human BMSCs undergoing adipogenic induction at day 7 vs. day 0.

WoS,DNA density-dependent uptake of DNA origami-based two-or three-dimensional nanostructures by immune cells,"DNA nanostructures are expected to be applied for targeted drug delivery to immune cells. However, the structural properties of DNA nanostructures required for the delivery have not fully been elucidated. In this study, we focused on the DNA density that can be important for the their recognition and uptake by immune cells. To examine this, DNA nanostructures with almost identical molecular weights and structural flexibility, but with different shapes and DNA densities, were designed using DNA origami technology. We compared the following five types of DNA nanostructures, all of which consisted of ten DNA helices using an identical circular, single-stranded scaffold and staples. Rec180 had a rectangular-shaped, almost flat structure. Rec90, Rec50 and Rec0 were bent forms of Rec180 at the center by 90, 50 or 0 degrees, respectively. Rec50/50 has two bends of 50 degrees each so that the both ends stick together to form a triangular prism shape. The fluctuation, or flexibility, of these DNA nanostructures under solution conditions was estimated using CanDo software. The DNA density estimated from the average distance between any two of the ten DNA helices in the DNA nanostructures was different among them; Rec50, Rec0 and Rec50/50 had a higher density than Rec180 and Rec90. Agarose gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy showed that all of the nanostructures were prepared with high yield. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the uptake of DNA nanostructures by murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells was higher for those with higher DNA density than those with low density. There was a positive correlation between the density and cellular uptake. These results indicate that DNA nanostructures with high DNA density are suitable for delivery to immune cells.",,"Maezawa, T; Ohtsuki, S; Hidaka, K; Sugiyama, H; Endo, M; Takahashi, Y; Takakura, Y; Nishikawa, M",2020.0,Journal,NANOSCALE,10.1039/d0nr02361b,"[Maezawa, Tatsuoki; Ohtsuki, Shozo; Takahashi, Yuki; Takakura, Yoshinobu; Nishikawa, Makiya] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Biopharmaceut & Drug Metab, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Hidaka, Kumi; Sugiyama, Hiroshi; Endo, Masayuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Chem, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Sugiyama, Hiroshi; Endo, Masayuki] Kyoto Univ, Inst Integrated Cell Mat Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nishikawa, Makiya] Tokyo Univ Sci, Lab Biopharmaceut, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Noda, Chiba 2788510, Japan",ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,English,2040-3364,
WoS,Attitudes toward consensual non-monogamy predicted by sociosexual behavior and avoidant attachment,"Consensual non-monogamy (CNM) relationships have increased in recent years. CNM is likely related to sociosexual behavior and attachment yet research is limited on these predictors and the interactions between them. Participants were 140 general population adults recruited via social media. Participants completed the Experience in Close Relationships Inventory, Sociosexual Orientation Inventory, Attitudes toward CNM scale and Willingness to Engage in CNM scale. Moderation analysis was conducted using Hayes' SPSS Process software. It was found that sociosexual behavior predicted attitudes toward CNM and this was moderated by avoidant attachment. This suggests that when individuals have low or moderate levels of avoidant attachment (i.e., are securely attached) then the relationship between sociosexual behavior and attitudes toward CNM is strengthened. It was also found that sociosexual behavior predicted willingness to engage in CNM, but anxious attachment did not moderate this relationship.

Nevertheless, few molecules have been introduced to inhibit N-cadherin protein to date. In this work, in order to find and present potent inhibitors, 3358 FDA-approved small molecules were docked against N-cadherin protein. All complexes with binding energy - 9 to - 8 kcal/mol were selected for protein-ligand interaction analysis. In the following, Tanimoto coefficient (T-c) was calculated for those molecules that established appropriate interactions with N-cadherin in order to compute the similarity score between them. Afterwards, molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculations were done to estimate the stability and ability of the chosen ligands in complex with the target protein.

WoS,"Structural and posttranslational analysis of human calcium-binding protein, spermatid-associated 1","Recently, we detected a novel biomarker in human saliva called calcium-binding protein, spermatid-associated 1 (CABS1). CABS1 protein had previously been described only in testis, and little was known of its characteristics other than it was considered a structurally disordered protein. Levels of human CABS1 (hCABS1) in saliva correlate with stress, whereas smaller sized forms of hCABS1 in saliva are associated with resilience to stress. Interestingly, hCABS1 also has an anti-inflammatory peptide sequence near its carboxyl terminus, similar to that of a rat prohormone, submandibular rat 1. We performed phylogenetic and sequence analysis of hCABS1. We found that from 72 CABS1 sequences currently annotated in the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein database, only 14 contain the anti-inflammatory domain TxIFELL, all of which are primates. We performed structural unfoldability analysis using PONDER and FoldIndex and discovered three domains that are highly disordered. Predictions of three-dimensional structure of hCABS1 using RaptorX, IonCom, and I-TASSER software agreed with these findings. Predicted neutrophil elastase cleavage density also correlated with hCABS1 regions of high structural disorder. Ligand binding prediction identified Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, leucine, and thiamine pyrophosphate, a pattern observed in enzymes associated with energy metabolism and mitochondrial localization. These new observations on hCABS1 raise intriguing questions about the interconnection between the autonomic nervous system, stress, and the immune system. However, the precise molecular mechanisms involved in the complex biology of hCABS1 remain unclear. We provide a detailed in silico analysis of relevant aspects of the structure and function of hCABS1 and postulate extracellular and intracellular roles.",anti-inflammatory peptides; CABS1; disordered domains; in silico analysis; IonCom; I-TASSER; posttranslational processing; RaptorX; resilience; stress,"Marcet-Palacios, M; Reyes-Serratos, E; Gonshor, A; Buck, R; Lacy, P; Befus, AD",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY,10.1002/jcb.29824,"[Marcet-Palacios, Marcelo; Reyes-Serratos, Eduardo; Lacy, Paige; Befus, A.

WoS,Treatment of idiopathic onychodystrophy with a 1064 nm picosecond neodymium-doped:yttrium aluminum garnet laser: A retrospective study,"Background Laser treatment has emerged as a novel treatment modality for onychodystrophy. Only a few small series have assessed the efficacy of laser treatment in onychodystrophy, most of which were case reports. The therapeutic effect of the 1064 nm neodymium-doped:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser for onychodystrophy has been demonstrated. Recently, the picosecond Nd:YAG (PSNY) laser has been introduced to improve various skin disorders. Aims The aim of this study was to verify the efficacy of a 1064 nm PSNY in management of idiopathic onychodystrophy. Methods We present a case series of dystrophic nails treated with a PSNY for onychodystrophy improvement. Planimetry using ImageJ software was used to calculate lesion reduction and proximal clear nail growth. Clinical improvement was assessed using a 5-point Global Assessment Scale (GAS). Adverse events were also assessed. Results Twenty-five patients (11 males and 14 females) with a total of 128 nails (94 finger nails and 34 toe nails) were treated. The mean treatment number was 8.7 +/- 6.2, and the mean total duration of treatment was 33.4 +/- 34.6 weeks. The average proportion of the lesion area decreased significantly (from 65.9% to 46.6%) after PSNY treatment (P < .001). The mean GAS (3.16 +/- 1.18) exhibited fair improvement, and there were no serious adverse events. Conclusion The 1064 nm PSNY laser can provide fair improvement for onychodystrophy with a good prognosis at least during the follow-up period and optimal cosmetic results in Asian patients.",laser treatment; nail dystrophy; neodymium-doped; yttrium aluminum garnet; onychodystrophy; picosecond,"Lee, YH; Lee, HJ; Kim, WS; Lee, GY; Choi, YJ",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF COSMETIC DERMATOLOGY,10.1111/jocd.13580,"[Lee, Yun Ho; Lee, Heun Joo; Kim, Won-Serk; Lee, Ga-Young; Choi, Young-Jun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Kangbuk Samsung Hosp, Dept Dermatol, 29 Saemunan Ro, Seoul 03181, South Korea",WILEY,English,1473-2130,
WoS,"The Heritability of Palatal Rugae Morphology Among Siblings*(,)dagger","Although there is clinical applicability of the palatal rugae as an identification tool in forensic odontology, controversy exists whether the palatal rugae patterns are stable or variable. The greater the genetic component, the higher the probability that palatal rugae patterns are stable. The aim of this study was to compare the palatal rugae morphology between full siblings and the proportion of variability due to genetic component. This cross-sectional study was conducted on digital models of 162 siblings aged 15-30 years old. The palatal rugae patterns were assessed with Thomas and Kotze (1983) classification using Geomagic Studio software (3D Systems, Rock Hill, SC). The palatal rugae morphology between siblings showed significantly similar characteristics for total number of left rugae (p = 0.001), left primary rugae (p = 0.017), secondary rugae for right (p = 0.024) and left sides (p = 0.001), right straight rugae (p = 0.010), and right convergent rugae (p = 0.005) accounting for at least 6.25%-12.8% of the variability due to heredity. Despite the similarities found, the palatal rugae patterns showed significant differences between siblings of at least 46.9% (p = 0.001). Zero heritability was found in 9 of the 14 rugae patterns. Meanwhile, total number of rugae, primary, backward, and convergent rugae showed moderate heritability (h(2) > 0.3) and total number of secondary rugae showed high heritability (h(2) > 0.6). In conclusion, despite the individuality characteristics, an appreciable hereditary component is observed with significant similarities found between sibling pairs and the palatal rugae patterns were both environmentally and genetically influenced.",identification tool; forensic odontology; heredity; siblings; palate; stable; rugae,"Chong, JA; Mohamed, AMFS; Nor, MM; Pau, A",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES,10.1111/1556-4029.14507,"[Chong, Jun Ai; Syed Mohamed, Alizae Marny Fadzlin; Marizan Nor, Murshida] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Family Oral Hlth, Discipline Orthodont, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, Kuala Lumpur 50300, Federal Territo, Malaysia; [Pau, Allan] Int Med Univ, Sch Dent, Dent Publ Hlth, 126,Jln Jalil Perkasa 19, Kuala Lumpur 57000, Federal Territo, Malaysia",WILEY,English,0022-1198,

The molecular character-based model provides discrete molecular diagnostic characters within DNA sequences that can be used in species descriptions fulfilling the requirement of most codes of nomenclature for a character-based description of species. Here, we introducefastachar, a software developed to extract molecular diagnostic characters from one or several taxonomically informative DNA markers of a selected taxon compared with those of other taxa in a single step. The input data consist of a single file with aligned sequences in the fasta format, which can be created using alignment software such asmegaorgeneious.fastacharis an easy-to-use software with a graphical interface.

WoS,Computational predictive approaches for interaction and structure of aptamers,"Aptamers are short single-strand sequences that can bind to their specific targets with high affinity and specificity. Usually, aptamers are selected experimentally via systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), an evolutionary process that consists of multiple cycles of selection and amplification. The SELEX process is expensive, time-consuming, and its success rates are relatively low. To overcome these difficulties, in recent years, several computational techniques have been developed in aptamer sciences that bring together different disciplines and branches of technologies. In this paper, a complementary review on computational predictive approaches of the aptamer has been organized. Generally, the computational prediction approaches of aptamer have been proposed to carry out in two main categories: interaction-based prediction and structure-based predictions. Furthermore, the available software packages and toolkits in this scope were reviewed. The aim of describing computational methods and tools in aptamer science is that aptamer scientists might take advantage of these computational techniques to develop more accurate and more sensitive aptamers.

WoS,Leveraging Anisotropy for Coupled Optimization of Thermal Transport and Light Transmission in Micro-Structured Materials for High-Power Laser Applications,"Maximum operating power densities in ceramic laser media scale with thermal conductivityk. This requires larger grain sizes in polycrystalline ceramics to reduce phonon scattering at grain boundaries. However, smaller grain sizes are preferred to minimize light scattering in the Rayleigh regime in polycrystals made from birefringent materials such as AlN and Al2O3, which are otherwise appealing for their highk. An optimization challenge arises from the opposite scaling laws governing the effects of grain sizes onkand light transmission. Here, this is tackled by introducing anisotropically microstructured materials (columnar/disk-shaped grains) as the lasing media, and allowing orthogonal heat transfer and lasing directions. For columnar grains, larger grain sizes along thec-axis help maintain highkfor good heat dissipation, while preserving light transmission properties in the orthogonal lasing and pumping directions. Analytical models for the thermal conductivity in such structures are presented and verified using Monte-Carlo ray-tracing simulations. Similarly, an approximate Rayleigh-Gans-Debye model is used to predict light transmission and verified with exact simulations using FEM software. Finally, the tradeoff between thermal and optical phenomena is captured in a new anisotropic figure-of-merit tensor, which is optimized for the microstructure that maximizes lasing media performance in AlN and Al(2)O(3)model systems.",anisotropic materials; figure of merit; high power ceramic lasers; light scattering; nanoscale thermal transport,"Mishra, V; Garay, JE; Dames, C",2020.0,JournalEA,ADVANCED THEORY AND SIMULATIONS,10.1002/adts.202000036,"[Mishra, Vivek; Dames, Chris] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, 6107 Etcheverry Hall,2521 Hearst Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mishra, Vivek] Intel Corp, Intel SC2,3065 Bowers Ave, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA; [Garay, Javier E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,English,,

WoS,Ensemble Models Based on QuBiLS-MAS Features and Shallow Learning for the Prediction of Drug-Induced Liver Toxicity: Improving Deep Learning and Traditional Approaches,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a key safety issue in the drug discovery pipeline and a regulatory concern. Thus, many in silico tools have been proposed to improve the hepatotoxicity prediction of organic-type chemicals. Here, classifiers for the prediction of DILI were developed by using QuBiLS-MAS 0-2.5D molecular descriptors and shallow machine learning techniques, on a training set composed of 1075 molecules. The best ensemble model build, E13, was obtained with good statistical parameters for the learning series, namely, the following: accuracy = 0.840, sensibility = 0.890, specificity = 0.761, Matthew's correlation coefficient = 0.660, and area under the ROC curve = 0.904. The model was also satisfactorily evaluated with Y-scrambling test, and repeated k-fold cross-validation and repeated k-holdout validation. In addition, an exhaustive external validation was also carried out by using two test sets and five external test sets, with an average accuracy value equal to 0.854 (+/- 0.062) and a coverage equal to 98.4% according to its applicability domain. A statistical comparison of the performance of the E13 model, with regard to results and tools (e.g., Padel DDPredictor Software, Deep Learning DILIserver, and Vslead) reported in the literature, was also performed. In general, E13 presented the best global performance in all experiments. The sum of the ranking differences procedure provided a very similar grouping pattern to that of the M-ANOVA statistical analysis, where E13 was identified as the best model for DILI predictions.

WoS,Python software tools for GNSS interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR),"Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interferometric reflectometry, also known as the GNSS-IR, uses data from geodetic-quality GNSS antennas to extract information about the environment surrounding the antenna. Soil moisture monitoring is one of the most important applications of the GNSS-IR technique. This manuscript presents the main ideas and implementation decisions needed to write the Python code for software tools that transform RINEX format observation and navigation files into an appropriate format for GNSS-IR (which includes the SNR observations and the azimuth and elevation of the satellites) and to determine the reflection height and the adjusted phase and amplitude values of the interferometric wave for each individual satellite track.

WoS,Temporal aiming,"Deflecting and changing the direction of propagation of electromagnetic waves are needed in multiple applications, such as in lens-antenna systems, point-to-point communications and radars. In this realm, metamaterials have been demonstrated to be great candidates for controlling wave propagation and wave-matter interactions by offering manipulation of their electromagnetic properties at will. They have been studied mainly in the frequency domain, but their temporal manipulation has become a topic of great interest during the past few years in the design of spatiotemporally modulated artificial media. In this work, we propose an idea for changing the direction of the energy propagation of electromagnetic waves by using time-dependent metamaterials, the permittivity of which is rapidly changed from isotropic to anisotropic values, an approach that we call temporal aiming. In so doing, here, we show how the direction of the Poynting vector becomes different from that of the wavenumber. Several scenarios are analytically and numerically evaluated, such as plane waves under oblique incidence and Gaussian beams, demonstrating how proper engineering of the isotropic-anisotropic temporal function of epsilon (r)(t) can lead to a redirection of waves to different spatial locations in real time. Metamaterials: temporal beam steeringTheoretical analysis shows that beam-steering of electromagnetic waves can be accomplished by temporally changing the permittivity of metamaterials between isotropic to anisotropic values. The approach, called temporal aiming, has been formulated by Victor Pacheco-Pena from Newcastle University, UK and Nader Engheta from University of Pennsylvania in the US. In principle, it could open new opportunities for the flow of information around integrated photonic circuits, with flat metamaterial elements deflecting electromagnetic waves to specific targets or receivers on an optical chip as desired. Simulations performed with the software COMSOL with both plane, monochromatic waves and more complex Gaussian beams confirm the feasibility of the approach. It is proposed that the required temporal changes in the metamaterial's relative permittivity could be achieved by the use of tunable metasurfaces or transmission lines with time-varying circuit elements.",,"Pacheco-Pena, V; Engheta, N",2020.0,Journal,LIGHT-SCIENCE & APPLICATIONS,10.1038/s41377-020-00360-1,"[Pacheco-Pena, Victor] Newcastle Univ, Sch Math Stat & Phys, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Engheta, Nader] Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,English,2047-7538,
WoS,The genetic variation of different developmental stages of Schistosoma japonicum: do the distribution in snails and pairing preference benefit the transmission?,"BackgroundSchistosoma japonicum is a waterborne parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans and in more than 40 animal species. Schistosoma japonicum shows distinct genetic differentiation among geographical populations and multiple hosts, but the genetic diversity of different developmental stages of S. japonicum from is less studied. Such studies could elucidate ecological mechanisms in disease transmission by analysing feedbacks in individual physiology and population state.MethodsAfter infection using cercariae from a pool of snails shedding together (Method I) and infection using mixed equal numbers of cercariae from individually shed snails (Method II), different developmental stages of S. japonicum were genotyped with microsatellite loci, including 346 cercariae, 701 adult worms and 393 miracidia. Genetic diversity and molecular variation were calculated at different population levels. Kinships (I) among cercariae at intra-snail and inter-snail levels were evaluated. Genetic distance (Dsw) was compared between paired and unpaired worms, and partner changing was investigated through paternity identification for miracidia.ResultsThe cercaria clones in individual snails varied from 1 to 8 and the kinship of cercariae within individual snails was significant higher (P<0.001) than that among different snails after deleting near-identical multi-locus genotypes (niMLGs). The allelic diversity of worms in Method I was lower (P<0.001) than that in Method II, and allele frequency among mice in Method I was also less consistent. The parents of some miracidia were worms that were not paired when collected. The Dsw between each female of paired and unpaired males was much larger (P<0.001) than that between the female and male in each pair.Conclusions p id=Par Most of the infected snails contained multiple miracidia clones. The aggregation of genetically similar S. japonicum miracidia in individual snails and the unbalanced distribution of miracidia among snails suggests a non-uniform genetic distribution of cercariae among snails in the field. This further influenced the genetic structure of adult worms from infections with different cercariae sampling methods. Schistosoma japonicum in mice can change paired partner, preferring to mate with genetically similar worms. These characteristics provide implications for understanding the balance in genetic diversity of S. japonicum related to the transmission of schistosomiasis.",Schistosoma japonicum; Genetic variation; Cercaria; Adult worm; Miracidium; Distribution; Pairing,"Gu, MJ; Li, YW; Emery, AM; Li, SZ; Jiang, YZ; Dong, HF; Zhao, QP",2020.0,Journal,PARASITES & VECTORS,10.1186/s13071-020-04240-w,"[Gu, Meng-Jie; Li, Yan-Wei; Dong, Hui-Fen; Zhao, Qin-Ping] Wuhan Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Parasitol, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan-Wei; Jiang, Yong-Zhong] Hubei Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Emery, Aidan M.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England; [Li, Shi-Zhu] Minist Hlth, WHO Collaborating Ctr Trop Dis, Natl Ctr Trop Dis Res,Natl Inst Parasit Dis, Key Lab Parasite & Vector Biol,Chinese Ctr Dis Co, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China",BMC,English,1756-3305,
WoS,Ontological model of multi-agent Smart-system for predicting drug properties based on modified algorithms of artificial immune systems,"Background Currently, due to the huge progress in the field of information technologies and computer equipment, it is important to use modern approaches of artificial intelligence in order to process extensive chemical information at creating new drugs with desired properties. The interdisciplinary of research creates additional difficulties in creating new drugs. Currently, there are no universal algorithms and software for predicting the structure-property dependence of drug compounds that can take into account the needs of specialists in this field. In this regard, the development of a modern Smart-system based on the promising bio-inspired approach of artificial immune systems for predicting the structure-property dependence of drug compounds is relevant. The aim of this work is to develop a multi-agent Smart-system for predicting the structure-property dependence of drug compounds using the ontological approach and modified algorithms of artificial immune systems using the example of drug compounds of the sulfonamide group. The proposed system makes it possible to increase the accuracy of prediction models of the structure-property dependence, to reduce the time and financial costs for obtaining candidate drug compounds. Methods During the creation of a Smart-system, there are used multi-agent and ontological approaches, which allow to structure input and output data, optimally to distribute computing resources and to coordinate the work of the system. As a promising approach for processing a large amount of chemical information, extracting informative descriptors and for the creation of an optimal data set, as well as further predicting the properties of medicinal compounds, there are considered modified algorithms of artificial immune systems and various algorithms of artificial intelligence. Results There was developed an ontological model of a multi-agent Smart-system. There are presented the results of the << structure-property >> dependence simulation based on a modified grey wolf optimization algorithm and artificial immune systems. During the simulation, there was used information from the Mol-Instincts sulfonamide descriptor database. Conclusion The developed multi-agent Smart-system using ontological models allows visually to present the structure and interrelationships of agents functioning, which greatly facilitates the development of software and reduces time and financial costs during the development of new drugs.",Smart-system; Drug design; Artificial immune system; Ontological model; Modified algorithms; Multi-agent system,"Samigulina, G; Samigulina, Z",2020.0,Journal,THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING,10.1186/s12976-020-00130-x,"[Samigulina, Galina] Inst Informat & Comp Technol, Lab Intellectual Control Syst & Forecasting, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan; [Samigulina, Zarina] Kazakh British Tech Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",BMC,English,,
WoS,An analysis of the Half-Perc versus open surgical placement method for a peritoneal dialysis catheter: a non-inferiority cohort study,"Background Most end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergo open surgical techniques for peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter placement. An alternative method to PD catheter implantation is the half-percutaneous (Half-Perc) technique based on a modified trocar that is performed by a nephrologist. The single-center, retrospective, observational, cohort study presented here aimed to compare the effects of the Half-Perc technique with the traditional open surgery on peritoneal catheter insertion. Methods From January 2015 to January 2018, 240 ESRD patients who received initial PD catheter placement were divided into two groups based on the Half-Perc technique or open surgery. All patients were followed up for 365 days or until loss of initial PD catheter or death. Prism 5 software was used to analyze baseline characteristics, operation-related parameters, mechanical complications and clinical outcomes. Results The Half-Perc technique showed shorter operation time, shorter incision length, lower postoperative pain scores and quick initiation of the PD program compared to the open surgery. After the 365-day follow-up, the Half-Perc group showed a higher rate of catheter dysfunction (4% versus 0.9%) that was corrected by conservative treatment in most patients and a lower rate of peritonitis (4% versus 9.6%) but mechanical complications and clinical outcomes did not differ between the two groups. There was also no significant difference based on overall patient mortality or catheter removal. One-year initial catheter survival and true catheter survival were not statistically different between the groups. Conclusion The Half-Perc placement of the PD catheter using a modified metal trocar appears to be a non-inferior alternative method and carries minimal invasiveness and risk compared to open surgical placement.",Half-Perc; Open surgery; Peritoneal dialysis; Catheter placement; Clinical outcome,"Zhang, DF; Peng, Y; Zheng, TT; Liu, H; Wu, JF; Li, ZW; Su, JX; Xu, Y; Hu, XX; Chen, GW; Hou, HJ; Zhang, L; Wu, LW; Liu, XS; Lu, FH",2020.0,Journal,BMC NEPHROLOGY,10.1186/s12882-020-01936-0,"[Zhang, Difei; Peng, Yu; Zheng, Tingting; Liu, Hui; Wu, Jianfeng; Li, Zewen; Su, Jingxu; Xu, Yuan; Hu, Xiaoxuan; Chen, Guowei; Hou, Haijing; Zhang, La; Wu, Liwen; Liu, Xusheng; Lu, Fuhua] Guangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Clin Coll 2, 111 Dade Rd, Guangzhou 510405, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Difei; Peng, Yu; Zheng, Tingting; Liu, Hui; Wu, Jianfeng; Li, Zewen; Su, Jingxu; Xu, Yuan; Hu, Xiaoxuan; Chen, Guowei; Hou, Haijing; Zhang, La; Wu, Liwen; Liu, Xusheng; Lu, Fuhua] Guangdong Prov Hosp Chinese Med, Dept Nephrol, 111 Dade Rd, Guangzhou 510120, Peoples R China",BMC,English,,
WoS,Immunization coverage in Ethiopia among 12-23month old children: systematic review and meta-analysis,"BackgroundImmunization is a cost-effective public health strategy. Immunization averts nearly three million deaths annually but immunization coverage is low in some countries and some regions within countries. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess pooled immunization coverage in Ethiopia.MethodA systematic search was done from PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, HINARI, and SCOPUS, WHO's Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS), African Journals Online databases, grey literature and reviewing reference lists of already identified articles. A checklist from the Joanna Briggs Institute was used for appraisal. The I-2 was used to assess heterogeneity among studies. Funnel plot were used to assess publication bias. A random effect model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of immunization among 12-23month old children using STATA 13 software.ResultTwenty eight articles were included in the meta-analysis with a total sample size of 20,048 children (12-23months old). The pooled prevalence of immunization among 12-23month old children in Ethiopia was found to be 47% (95%, CI: 46.0, 47.0). A subgroup analysis by region indicated the lowest proportion of immunized children in the Afar region, 21% (95%, CI: 18.0, 24.0) and the highest in the Amhara region, 89% (95%, CI: 85.0, 92.0).ConclusionNearly 50% of 12-23month old children in Ethiopia were fully vaccinated according to this systematic review and meta-analysis this indicates that the coverage, is still low with a clear disparity among regions.

WoS,Accuracy and safety of C2 pedicle or pars screw placement: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Study design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Aim The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and accuracy of the C2 pedicle versus C2 pars screws placement and free-hand technique versus navigation for upper cervical fusion patients. Methods Databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify all papers published up to April 2020 that have evaluated C2 pedicle/pars screws placement accuracy. Two authors individually screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The accuracy rates associated with C2 pedicle/pars were extracted. The pooled accuracy rate estimated was performed by the CMA software. A funnel plot based on accuracy rate estimate was used to evaluate publication bias. Results From 1123 potentially relevant studies, 142 full-text publications were screened. We analyzed data from 79 studies involving 4431 patients with 6026 C2 pedicle or pars screw placement. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to evaluate the quality of studies included in this review. Overall, funnel plot and Begg's test did not indicate obvious publication bias. The pooled analysis reveals that the accuracy rates were 93.8% for C2 pedicle screw free-hand, 93.7% for pars screw free-hand, 92.2% for navigated C2 pedicle screw, and 86.2% for navigated C2 pars screw (all,Pvalue < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed between the accuracy of placement C2 pedicle versus C2 pars screws with the free-hand technique and the free-hand C2 pedicle group versus the navigated C2 pedicle group (all,Pvalue > 0.05).

WoS,Single versus double chest drains after pulmonary lobectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Previous randomized controlled trials have compared the efficacy and safety of single chest drain (SCD) and double chest drains (DCD) in the patients undergone pulmonary lobectomy, yet the results remain inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to conduct this present systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the role of SCD and DCD in the patients undergone pulmonary lobectomy. Methods PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Weipu, and China Biomedical Literature databases were searched up to February 28, 2020, to identify the potential RCTs on SCD and DCD in the patients undergone pulmonary lobectomy. The main outcomes including verbal pain score, the duration of drainage (days), the length of hospital stay (days), and the incidence of air leak and re-drainage were collected and analyzed. All the data were processed and analyzed with software RevMan 5.3. We calculated and analyzed the odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. Results A total of 11 RCTs with 1214 patients were included, in which 589 patients received SCD treatment and 625 patients DCD treatment. The verbal pain score (MD = - 0.54, 95%CI (- 0.87, - 0.21)), the duration of drainage (MD = - 0.65, 95%CI (- 1.04, - 0.26)), and the length of hospital stay (MD = - 0.55, 95%CI (- 0.80, - 0.29)) in SCD group were significantly less than that of DCD group. There were no significant differences on the incidence of air leak (OR = 1.35, 95%CI (0.86, 2.11)) and re-drainage (OR = 0.88, 95%CI (0.41, 1.90)) among the two groups.

WoS,Neural dynamics of perceptual inference and its reversal during imagery,"After the presentation of a visual stimulus, neural processing cascades from low-level sensory areas to increasingly abstract representations in higher-level areas. It is often hypothesised that a reversal in neural processing underlies the generation of mental images as abstract representations are used to construct sensory representations in the absence of sensory input. According to predictive processing theories, such reversed processing also plays a central role in later stages of perception. Direct experimental evidence of reversals in neural information flow has been missing. Here, we used a combination of machine learning and magnetoencephalography to characterise neural dynamics in humans. We provide direct evidence for a reversal of the perceptual feed-forward cascade during imagery and show that, during perception, such reversals alternate with feed-forward processing in an 11 Hz oscillatory pattern. Together, these results show how common feedback processes support both veridical perception and mental imagery.",,"Dijkstra, N; Ambrogioni, L; Vidaurre, D; van Gerven, M",2020.0,Journal,ELIFE,10.7554/eLife.53588,"[Dijkstra, Nadine; Ambrogioni, Luca; van Gerven, Marcel] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Ctr Cognit, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Dijkstra, Nadine] UCL, Wellcome Ctr Human Neuroimaging, London, England; [Vidaurre, Diego] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Human Brain Act, Oxford, England; [Vidaurre, Diego] Aarhus Univ, Dept Clin Hlth, Aarhus, Denmark",ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,English,2050-084X,
WoS,Criteria for assessing a sustainable hotel business,"Numerous events over the last six decades have made it necessary to reformulate the economic development models proposed by capitalism. In this context, sustainability has emerged with the aim of balancing corporate interests with stakeholders' needs. To facilitate this aim, organizations must build a productive management relationship with their stakeholders and thus understand the implications of their operations in all dimensions of sustainability. In this context, due to the potential negative environmental, cultural, and social impacts of tourism, hotels have a responsibility to act in a sustainable manner. Therefore, the objective of this research was to identify criteria against which hotels can measure their impacts. A quali-quantitative study was developed based on the following stages: (1) preparing a workshop that enabled the analysis of 66 possible criteria when designing sustainable hospitality; (2) understanding the degree of importance of each of these criteria based on a semistructured questionnaire applied to 177 professionals linked to the hotel market and academia; and (3) using software R to run a confirmatory factor analysis that validated 39 criteria distributed with regard to the following dimensions: environmental (11), social (10), cultural (4), economic (8), and political (6). We conclude that using these criteria will allow hotel managers to develop more holistic, systemic, integrated, and participatory strategies and to play an active role in building economically profitable, socially just, culturally compatible, and environmentally responsible societies.

Subjects/Methods Forty-four consecutive patients aged 40-65 years having type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with DMO were prospectively recruited for IVB therapy. It comprised of three doses (1.25 mg in 0.05 ml) of IVB at monthly intervals. Patients with other ocular and systemic diseases affecting retinal vessels and earlier ophthalmological interventions were excluded. Visual acuity (logMAR VA) was recorded. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed pre and post intervention. Central sub-foveal thickness (CST) and grades of disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL), external limiting membrane (ELM) and EZ were assessed. Data were statistically analysed on SPSS software. Clinical trials registry: CTRI/2019/03/018135. Results Mean logMAR VA decreased after IVB therapy from 1.78 +/- 0.07 pre-intervention to 0.42 +/- 0.05 post intervention (p < 0.001). Similarly, CST reduced from 354.23 +/- 15.0 mu m pre-intervention to 233.18 +/- 7.88 mu m post intervention (p < 0.001). Among qualitative variables, DRIL decreased from 93.2% pre-intervention to 13.6% post intervention.

WoS,CFDP PDU Tunneling Service over DTN Between Heterogeneous Deep Space Communication Assets,"In space exploration missions, the spacecraft have limited computing resources. In particular, the communications environments for these spacecraft, whether in deep space or the cislunar region, are characterized by intermittent connectivity loss, long signal-propagation delay, and high bit-error rates between spacecraft and their ground stations. Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) has been introduced to enable automated, efficient communication among flight-mission entities in these environments. However, most flight-mission entities are not yet equipped for DTN; a mechanism is needed whereby DTN-enabled entities and non-DTN-enabled entities can easily interoperate. The CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) is supported in both DTN and non-DTN communication fabrics, so perhaps CFDP file transmission can serve as the common communication medium that bridges the two. When CFDP runs without a Bundle Protocol (BP), it requires a more complex CFDP implementation, and multi-hop communication is more difficult to configure. This paper presents a tunneling mechanism that relays CFDP protocol data units (PDUs) between a non-DTN-enabled CFDP entity and a DTN-enabled CFDP entity. This enables CFDP-over-link implementations to bridge into BP networks to simplify multi-hop forwarding through the BP network. A proof-of-concept implementation of the tunneling service has been developed and tested using the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) DTN software to evaluate this concept of CFDP PDU relay/forward functionality to enable communication between the two heterogeneous space communication fabrics. Test setup, test results, and future work on the tunneling service are also discussed.",CCSDS file delivery protocol; Delay; disruption-tolerant networking; Interplanetary internet; Bundle protocol; Solar system internet; Interplanetary overlay network; Cislunar communications; Deep-space communications,"Koo, CH; Kim, H",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICAL AND SPACE SCIENCES,10.1007/s42405-020-00303-5,"[Koo, Cheol Hea] Korea Aerosp Res Inst KARI, Daejeon, South Korea; [Koo, Cheol Hea; Kim, Hyungshin] Chungnam Natl Univ CNU, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Daejeon, South Korea",SPRINGER,English,2093-274X,
WoS,A quantitative thiol reactivity profiling platform to analyze redox and electrophile reactive cysteine proteomes,"Cysteine is unique among all protein-coding amino acids, owing to its intrinsically high nucleophilicity. The cysteinyl thiol group can be covalently modified by a broad range of redox mechanisms or by various electrophiles derived from exogenous or endogenous sources. Measuring the response of protein cysteines to redox perturbation or electrophiles is critical for understanding the underlying mechanisms involved. Activity-based protein profiling based on thiol-reactive probes has been the method of choice for such analyses. We therefore adapted this approach and developed a new chemoproteomic platform, termed 'QTRP' (quantitative thiol reactivity profiling), that relies on the ability of a commercially available thiol-reactive probe IPM (2-iodo-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)acetamide) to covalently label, enrich and quantify the reactive cysteinome in cells and tissues. Here, we provide a detailed and updated workflow of QTRP that includes procedures for (i) labeling of the reactive cysteinome from cell or tissue samples (e.g., control versus treatment) with IPM, (ii) processing the protein samples into tryptic peptides and tagging the probe-modified peptides with isotopically labeled azido-biotin reagents containing a photo-cleavable linker via click chemistry reaction, (iii) capturing biotin-conjugated peptides with streptavidin beads, (iv) identifying and quantifying the photo-released peptides by mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics and (v) interpreting MS data by a streamlined informatic pipeline using a proteomics software, pFind 3, and an automatic post-processing algorithm. We also exemplified here how to use QTRP for mining H2O2-sensitive cysteines and for determining the intrinsic reactivity of cysteines in a complex proteome. We anticipate that this protocol should find broad applications in redox biology, chemical biology and the pharmaceutical industry. The protocol for sample preparation takes 3 d, whereas MS measurements and data analyses require 75 min and <30 min, respectively, per sample. Proteomic cysteines can undergo redox reactions and electrophile-derived modifications. In QTRP, a thiol-reactive probe is used to covalently label, enrich and quantify the reactive cysteinome in cultured cells and tissue samples.",,"Fu, L; Li, ZM; Liu, KK; Tian, CP; He, JX; He, JY; He, FC; Xu, P; Yang, J",2020.0,JournalEA,NATURE PROTOCOLS,10.1038/s41596-020-0352-2,"[Fu, Ling; Li, Zongmin; Liu, Keke; Tian, Caiping; He, Jixiang; He, Jingyang; He, Fuchu; Xu, Ping; Yang, Jing] Beijing Inst Life, State Key Lab Prote, Beijing Proteome Res Ctr, Natl Ctr Prot Sci Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fu, Ling] Qingdao Univ, Med Coll, Innovat Inst Med Sch, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Li, Zongmin; Xu, Ping] Anhui Med Univ, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Tian, Caiping; He, Fuchu] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Beijing, Peoples R China",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,English,1754-2189,
WoS,Deep learning vs. atlas-based models for fast auto-segmentation of the masticatory muscles on head and neck CT images,"Background Impaired function of masticatory muscles will lead to trismus. Routine delineation of these muscles during planning may improve dose tracking and facilitate dose reduction resulting in decreased radiation-related trismus. This study aimed to compare a deep learning model with a commercial atlas-based model for fast auto-segmentation of the masticatory muscles on head and neck computed tomography (CT) images. Material and methods Paired masseter (M), temporalis (T), medial and lateral pterygoid (MP, LP) muscles were manually segmented on 56 CT images. CT images were randomly divided into training (n = 27) and validation (n = 29) cohorts. Two methods were used for automatic delineation of masticatory muscles (MMs): Deep learning auto-segmentation (DLAS) and atlas-based auto-segmentation (ABAS). The automatic algorithms were evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, precision, Hausdorff distance (HD), HD95, and mean surface distance (MSD). A consolidated score was calculated by normalizing the metrics against interobserver variability and averaging over all patients. Differences in dose ( increment Dose) to MMs for DLAS and ABAS segmentations were assessed. A paired t-test was used to compare the geometric and dosimetric difference between DLAS and ABAS methods. Results DLAS outperformed ABAS in delineating all MMs (p < 0.05). The DLAS mean DSC for M, T, MP, and LP ranged from 0.83 +/- 0.03 to 0.89 +/- 0.02, the ABAS mean DSC ranged from 0.79 +/- 0.05 to 0.85 +/- 0.04. The mean value for recall, HD, HD95, MSD also improved with DLAS for auto-segmentation. Interobserver variation revealed the highest variability in DSC and MSD for both T and MP, and the highest scores were achieved for T by both automatic algorithms. With few exceptions, the mean increment D98%, increment D95%, increment D50%, and increment D2% for all structures were below 10% for DLAS and ABAS and had no detectable statistical difference (P > 0.05). DLAS based contours had dose endpoints more closely matched with that of the manually segmented when compared with ABAS. Conclusions DLAS auto-segmentation of masticatory muscles for the head and neck radiotherapy had improved segmentation accuracy compared with ABAS with no qualitative difference in dosimetric endpoints compared to manually segmented contours.",Deep learning model; Masticatory muscles; Auto-segmentation,"Chen, W; Li, YM; Dyer, BA; Feng, X; Rao, S; Benedict, SH; Chen, Q; Rong, Y",2020.0,Journal,RADIATION ONCOLOGY,10.1186/s13014-020-01617-0,"[Chen, Wen] Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wen; Dyer, Brandon A.; Rao, Shyam; Benedict, Stanley H.; Rong, Yi] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Radiat Oncol, Med Ctr, 4501 X St,Suite 0152, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Li, Yimin] Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Radiat Oncol, Xiamen Canc Ctr, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Dyer, Brandon A.] Univ Washington, Dept Radiat Oncol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Feng, Xue; Chen, Quan] Carina Med LLC, 145 Graham Ave,A168, Lexington, KY 40536 USA; [Chen, Quan] Univ Kentucky, Markey Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, RM CC063,800 Rose St, Lexington, KY 40536 USA",BMC,English,,
WoS,"Expression of GPR55 and either cannabinoid CB(1)or CB(2)heteroreceptor complexes in the caudate, putamen, and accumbens nuclei of control, parkinsonian, and dyskinetic non-human primates","Endocannabinoids are neuromodulators acting on specific cannabinoid CB(1)and CB(2)G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), representing potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases. Cannabinoids also regulate the activity of GPR55, a recently deorphanized GPCR that directly interacts with CB(1)and with CB(2)receptors. Our hypothesis is that these heteromers may be taken as potential targets for Parkinson's disease (PD). This work aims at assessing the expression of heteromers made of GPR55 and CB1/CB(2)receptors in the striatum of control and parkinsonian macaques (with and without levodopa-induced dyskinesia). For this purpose, double blind in situ proximity ligation assays, enabling the detection of GPCR heteromers in tissue samples, were performed in striatal sections of control, MPTP-treated and MPTP-treated animals rendered dyskinetic by chronic treatment with levodopa. Image analysis and statistical assessment were performed using dedicated software. We have previously demonstrated the formation of heteromers between GPR55 and CB(1)receptor (CB1-GPR55_Hets), which is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), but also with the CB(2)receptor (CB2-GPR55_Hets). Compared to the baseline expression of CB1-GPR55_Hets in control animals, our results showed increased expression levels in basal ganglia input nuclei of MPTP-treated animals. These observed increases in CB1-GPR55_Hets returned back to baseline levels upon chronic treatment with levodopa in dyskinetic animals. Obtained data regarding CB2-GPR55_Hets were quite similar, with somehow equivalent amounts in control and dyskinetic animals, and with increased expression levels in MPTP animals. Taken together, the detected increased expression of GPR55-endocannabinoid heteromers appoints these GPCR complexes as potential non-dopaminergic targets for PD therapy.",G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) heteromer; Levodopa; Parkinson's disease; Proximity ligation assay (PLA); Striatum,"Martinez-Pinilla, E; Rico, AJ; Rivas-Santisteban, R; Lillo, J; Roda, E; Navarro, G; Lanciego, JL; Franco, R",2020.0,JournalEA,BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION,10.1007/s00429-020-02116-4,"[Martinez-Pinilla, Eva] Univ Oviedo, Fac Med, Dept Morphol & Cell Biol, Julian Claveria S-N, Asturias 33006, Spain; [Martinez-Pinilla, Eva] Inst Neurociencias Principado Asturias INEUROPA, Asturias, Spain; [Martinez-Pinilla, Eva] Inst Invest Sanitaria Principado Asturias ISPA, Asturias, Spain; [Rico, Alberto J.; Roda, Elvira; Luis Lanciego, Jose] Univ Navarra, Ctr Appl Med Res, Neurosci Div, CIMA, Ave Pio XII,55, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Rico, Alberto J.; Roda, Elvira; Luis Lanciego, Jose] Inst Invest Sanitarias Navarra IdiSNA, Pamplona, Spain; [Rico, Alberto J.; Rivas-Santisteban, Rafael; Lillo, Jaume; Roda, Elvira; Navarro, Gemma; Luis Lanciego, Jose; Franco, Rafael] Ctr Invest Biomed Red Enfermedades Neurodegenerat, Madrid, Spain; [Rivas-Santisteban, Rafael; Lillo, Jaume; Franco, Rafael] Univ Barcelona, Sch Chem, Dept Biochem & Mol Biomed, Mol Neurobiol Lab, Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Navarro, Gemma] Univ Barcelona, Fac Pharm & Food Sci, Dept Biochem & Physiol, Barcelona, Spain",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1863-2653,

WoS,Reconnaissance scale mapping of salinity in three-dimensions usingEM38andEM34data and inversion modelling,"In irrigated areas, the spectre of soil salinisation is ever-present. To obtain baseline data to map salt, or the soil electrical conductivity of a saturated soil paste extract (ECe, dS m(-1)), we use electromagnetic (EM) data from a survey of EM38 and EM34 data with EM inversion software (EM4Soil). This is because the collected apparent electrical conductivity (ECa, mS m(-1)) can be inverted to estimate true electrical conductivity (sigma, mS m(-1)) and correlated with ECe. To do this we use a quasi-two dimensional (Q-2D) model along a pseudo-transect, which includes seven soil sample locations, to make a linear regression (LR) calibration between sigma and ECe(i.e., ECe= 0.0122 x sigma - 0.0535 [R-2= .71]). From the joint inversion of interpolated EM38 and EM34 EC(a)across 40,000 ha, a quasi-three dimensional (Q-3D) model was then used to predict ECe. The model was validated using 30 soil sample locations scattered across the area. The agreement between predicted and measured EC(e)was moderate (Lin's concordance = 0.59) and conclude that useful information on a reconnaissance scale can be obtained and indicates where more detailed information may be collected to confirm areas of moderate salinity. To better predict ECe, more EC(a)could be collected on smaller grid spacings (i.e., 0.5 km and 1 km in irrigated and dryland areas, respectively).

UsingFrankliniella fuscaas a thrips species of focus, we empirically developed a composite model of thrips phenology and cotton seedling susceptibility to predict site-specific infestation risk so that monitoring and other resources can be allocated efficiently, to optimize the timing of thrips control measures to maximize effectiveness, and to inform stakeholders about the dynamics of thrips infestation and cotton seedling injury at a time when thrips are evolving resistance to commonly-used pesticides. Results A mixture distribution model of thrips infestation potential, fit to data describingF. fuscaadult dispersal in time, proved best for predicting infestations ofF. fuscaon cotton seedlings. Thrips generations occurring each year as a function of weather are represented as a probability distribution. A model of cotton seedling growth was also developed to predict susceptibility as a function of weather. Combining these two models resulted in a model of seedling injury, which was validated and developed for implementation as a software tool. Conclusions Experimental validation of the implemented model demonstrated the utility of its output in predicting infestation risk.

WoS,"Targeted exome sequencing designed for blood group, platelet, and neutrophil antigen investigations: Proof-of-principle study for a customized single-test system","Background Immunohematology reference laboratories provide red blood cell (RBC), platelet (PLT), and neutrophil typing to resolve complex cases, using serology and commercial DNA tests that define clinically important antigens. Broad-range exome sequencing panels that include blood group targets provide accurate blood group antigen predictions beyond those defined by serology and commercial typing systems and identify rare and novel variants. The aim of this study was to design and assess a panel for targeted exome sequencing of RBC, PLT, and neutrophil antigen-associated genes to provide a comprehensive profile in a single test, excluding unrelated gene targets. Study Design and Methods An overlapping probe panel was designed for the coding regions of 64 genes and loci involved in gene expression. Sequencing was performed on 34 RBC and 17 PLT/neutrophil reference samples. Variant call outputs were analyzed using software to predict star allele diplotypes. Results were compared with serology and previous sequence genotyping data. Results Average coverage exceeded 250x, with more than 94% of targets at Q30 quality or greater. Increased coverage revealed a variant in the Scianna system that was previously undetected. The software correctly predicted allele diplotypes for 99.5% of RBC blood groups tested and 100% of PLT and HNA antigens excepting HNA-2. Optimal throughput was 12 to 14 samples per run. Conclusion This single-test system demonstrates high coverage and quality, allowing for the detection of previously overlooked variants and increased sample throughput.

WoS,Dynamic scheduling model for the construction industry,"Purpose Basic project control through traditional methods is not sufficient to manage the majority of real-time events in most construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to propose a Dynamic Scheduling (DS) model that utilizes multi-objective optimization of cost, time, resources and cash flow, throughout project construction. Design/methodology/approach Upon reviewing the topic of DS, a worldwide internet survey with 364 respondents was conducted to define end-user requirements. The model was formulated and solution algorithms discussed. Verification was reported using predefined problem sets and a real-life case. Validation was performed via feedback from industry experts. Findings The need for multi-objective dynamic software optimization of construction schedules and the ability to choose among a set of optimal alternatives were highlighted. Model verification through well-known test cases and a real-life project case study showed that the model successfully achieved the required dynamic functionality whether under the small solved example or under the complex case study. The model was validated for practicality, optimization of various DS schedule quality gates, ease of use and software integration with contemporary project management practices. Practical implications Optimized real-time scheduling can provide better resources management including labor utilization and cost efficiency. Furthermore, DS contributes to optimum materials procurement, thus minimizing waste. Social implications Optimized real-time scheduling can provide better resources management including labor utilization and cost efficiency. Furthermore, DS contributes to optimum materials procurement, thus minimizing waste.

WoS,Attitudes of Indian Dental Professionals towards Information Technology - A Cross Sectional Study,"BACKGROUND There have been substantial advances in the field of information technology (IT) which has led to the development of computer networks which allow access to an enormous amount of data. In 1971, computer was first introduced in dentistry and since then it has positively impacted the dental students' attitudes and perceptions towards information technology. METHODS A pretested, structured, multisection electronic survey (e-survey) form was used which was prepared using Google Forms. The questionnaire was distributed among a group of people by forwarding and posting of Google survey form link through WhatsApp groups, sending an invitation via e-mail, and distribution of printed questionnaires to health professionals to participate in the study. Data was automatically collected in Google Drive. Necessary statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software package SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA) version 22.0 for MS Windows & P < 0.05. RESULTS The response rate was higher among females than males i.e. 57% and 43% for females and males respectively. Among participants, students were highest in number (35%) followed by academicians (30%), self-employed (26%) and lowest was associate health professionals (9%). When asked about making computer training a part of the undergraduate curriculum, a majority (84%) of respondents suggested 'Yes', few (12%) suggested 'No' and only 'very few' (4%) were uncertain. CONCLUSIONS Results of this study highlighted the fact that there was easy access to a computer and internet among dental health professionals in India.

WoS,Numerical simulation to study and optimize the significant hidden temperature gradients in adiabatic tests,"In adiabatic thermal analysis, correct measurement of temperature is usually ensured by means of a calibration procedure and thermal inertia corrections. However, there is a significant gradient within system, which not only makes the obtained test results inaccurate, but also causes serious errors in subsequent kinetic calculations and thermal risk assessment. Thus, estimations of the temperature gradients, which appear into the sample, are of highest interest to choose the right operational conditions that minimize that gradient. In this work, the CFD software has been applied to study this temperature gradient issue in adiabatic system. In view of the causes of temperature gradients, the influencing factors and the resulting analysis errors are all deeply researched. In addition, three different kinds of adiabaticity control model cases have also been simulated to explore the right operational conditions that minimize gradient and provide more reliable kinetics and thermal hazard parameters (Q(infinity),k(0),E-a,n,T-D24,TCL). After a comparative study, the authors define the more reliable operational conditions, which include selecting a suitable temperature response value and the adiabatic temperature control model. Finally, the reliability of the adiabaticity control model that achieves the minimum temperature gradients and provides the most accurate calculation results was verified through the different adiabatic tests.",Adiabatic calorimetry; Numerical simulation; Temperature gradients; Thermokinetic errors; 15% DTBP solution,"Zhang, J; Ma, YY; Dong, Z; Wang, SY; Chen, LP; Chen, WH",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY,10.1007/s10973-020-09972-6,"[Zhang, Jun; Chen, Liping; Chen, Wanghua] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Safety Engn, 200 Xiaolingwei Rd, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jun; Ma, Yingying; Dong, Ze] Solvay China Co Ltd, Shanghai 201108, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shunyao] Jinling Inst Technol, 99 Hongjing Ave, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,1388-6150,

WoS,"The timing mega-study: comparing a range of experiment generators, both lab-based and online","Many researchers in the behavioral sciences depend on research software that presents stimuli, and records response times, with sub-millisecond precision. There are a large number of software packages with which to conduct these behavioral experiments and measure response times and performance of participants. Very little information is available, however, on what timing performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular packages: PsychoPy, E-Prime (R), NBS Presentation (R), Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that macOS was the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on several browser/operating system combinations. For response times (measured using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between OS/browser combinations, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought about the sources of variability that result. The results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software packages for the task.

Interviews were conducted with the staff of companies that represent four nodes in the mango export supply chain from Brazil to the USA. All interviews were also recorded and transcribed literally in NVivo software, and a coding system was developed based on the literature. The main results indicate that the exchange rate and dependence on a single transport mode are the main sources of risk for the mango supply chain.

WoS,Tomographic assessment of palatal suture opening pattern and pterygopalatine suture disarticulation in the axial plane after midfacial skeletal expansion,"Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the palatal suture opening and the pterygopalatine suture disarticulation pattern in the tomographic axial plane after treatment with midfacial skeletal expander (MSE). Materials and methods Pre- and post-expansion CBCT records of 50 subjects (20 males, 30 females, mean age 18 +/- 3 years) who were treated with MSE (Biomaterials Korea, Seoul, Korea) appliance were superimposed and compared using OnDemand software. Reference planes were identified and the angulation of the midpalatal suture opening after expansion was calculated as well as the frequency of the pterygopalatine suture split. Results After MSE treatment, the mean palatal suture opening angle (SOA) was 0.57 degrees. (- 0.8 degrees to 1.3 degrees). There was no significant difference between males and females in terms of the palatal suture opening pattern (P> 0.05). Only 3 out of 50 (6%) subjects presented SOA above 1 degree. Also, 3 out of 50 (6%) patients presented a negative SOA value. With regard to the pterygopalatine suture split, 84 sutures out of 100 (84%) presented openings between the medial and lateral pterygoid plates on both right and left sides. Partial split was detected with 8 patients (5 females, 3 males). Five patients had split only in the medial pterygoid plates of both pterygomaxillary sutures, and 3 patients exhibited disarticulation on the right side only. No significant differences were found in the frequency of suture opening between males and females (P= 1.000). Conclusions MSE appliance performed almost parallel expansion in the axial view. Remarkably, this study shows that pterygopalatine suture can be split by MSE appliance without the surgical intervention; the disarticulation of pterygopalatine suture was visible in most of the patients.",Maxillary expansion; Midpalatal suture; Midfacial skeletal expander (MSE); Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT),"Colak, O; Paredes, NA; Elkenawy, I; Torres, M; Bui, J; Jahangiri, S; Moon, W",2020.0,Journal,PROGRESS IN ORTHODONTICS,10.1186/s40510-020-00321-9,"[Colak, Ozge; Paredes, Ney Alberto; Elkenawy, Islam; Torres, Martha; Bui, Joseph; Jahangiri, Sara; Moon, Won] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Hlth Sci, Sch Dent, Room 63-082 CHS,10833 Le Conte Ave,Box 951668, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",SPRINGER,English,2196-1042,
WoS,Association between complement 4 copy number variation and systemic lupus erythematosus: a meta-analysis,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by multiple genetic mutations. Complement 4 (C4) copy number variation (CNV) is a target-of-interest located on chromosome 6. C4 encodes for either of the two C4 paralogs, C4A or C4B, and low C4 levels have been associated with SLE activity. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively understand the role of C4 CNV in SLE. Three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) were searched for relevant studies. Two investigators independently extracted and evaluated data from eligible studies. Associations between C4 CNV and SLE were estimated by odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Further analysis was conducted using the STATA 12.0 software. A total of eight case-control studies were included in the analysis with 4107 SLE patients and 5889 healthy controls. Six studies used TaqMan real-time PCR to genotype C4 CNV, with 1 study used paralog ratio test and other one used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Lower total C4 CNV and C4A CNV were associated with SLE in the overall analysis (pooled OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.23-1.95; pooled OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.51-2.29). The subgroup analysis found that total C4 CNV and lower C4A CNV were significantly associated with SLE in Caucasians (pooled OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.60-2.12; pooled OR: 2.23, 95% CI:1.92-2.59). However, the association was not detected in East Asians. Lastly, SLE was not associated with C4B CNV, long C4 CNV, or short C4 CNV. The meta-analysis confirmed that lower total C4 CNV and lower C4A CNV are associated with SLE in certain populations. Future studies should consider other ethnic groups to further investigate the relationship between the C4 gene and SLE.",Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); C4; CNV; C4 copy number variation; Meta-analysis,"Wu, ZY; Zhang, SL; Li, P; Zhang, FC; Li, YZ",2020.0,JournalEA,CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE,10.1007/s10238-020-00640-5,"[Wu, Ziyan; Zhang, Shulan; Li, Ping; Zhang, Fengchun] Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Dept Rheumatol & Clin Immunol, Peking Union Med Coll Hosp, Key Lab Rheumatol & Clin Immunol,Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yongzhe] Peking Union Med Coll & Chinese Acad Med Sci, Dept Clin Lab, 1 Shuaifuyuan Hutong, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China",SPRINGER-VERLAG ITALIA SRL,English,1591-8890,
WoS,The hemodynamic and metabolic effects of spironolactone treatment in acute kidney injury assessed by hyperpolarized MRI,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the most common types of acute kidney injury. Spironolactone has shown promising kidney protective effects in renal IRI in rats. We investigated the hemodynamic and metabolic effects of spironolactone (100 mg/kg) administered immediately after 40 min unilateral kidney ischemia in rats. Hyperpolarized MRI using co-polarized [1-C-13]pyruvate and [C-13,N-15(2)]urea as well as(1)H dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI was performed 24 h after induction of ischemia. We found a significant decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) in the ischemic kidney compared with the contralateral one measured using DCE and [C-13,N-15(2)]urea. The RBF measured using [1-C-13]pyruvate and [C-13,N-15(2)]urea was significantly altered by spironolactone. The RBFs in the ischemic kidney compared with the contralateral kidney were decreased similarly as measured using both [C-13,N-15(2)]urea and [1-C-13]pyruvate in the spironolactone-treated group. Spironolactone treatment increased the perfusion-corrected pyruvate metabolism by 54% in both the ischemic and contralateral kidney. Furthermore, we showed a correlation between vascular permeability using a histological Evans blue analysis and the ratio of the volumes of distribution (VoDs), ie VoD-[C-13,N-15(2)]urea/VoD-[1-C-13]pyruvate.

WoS,A case series study of augmented reality in laparoscopic liver resection with a deformable preoperative model,"Background Previous work in augmented reality (AR) guidance in monocular laparoscopic hepatectomy requires the surgeon to manually overlay a rigid preoperative model onto a laparoscopy image. This may be fairly inaccurate because of significant liver deformation. We have proposed a technique which overlays adeformablepreoperative model semi-automatically onto a laparoscopic image using a new software calledHepataug. The aim of this study is to show the feasibility ofHepataugto perform AR with a deformable model in laparoscopic hepatectomy. Methods We ranHepataugduring the procedures, as well as the usual means of laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) and visual inspection of the preoperative CT or MRI. The primary objective was to assess the feasibility ofHepataug, in terms of minimal disruption of the surgical workflow. The secondary objective was to assess the potential benefit ofHepataug, by subjective comparison with LUS. Results From July 2017 to March 2019, 17 consecutive patients were included in this study. AR was feasible in all procedures, with good correlation with LUS. However, for 2 patients, LUS did not reveal the location of the tumors.Hepatauggave a prediction of the tumor locations, which was confirmed and refined by careful inspection of the preoperative CT or MRI. Conclusion Hepataugshowed a minimal disruption of the surgical workflow and can thus be feasibly used in real hepatectomy procedures. Thanks to its new mechanism of semi-automatic deformable alignment,Hepataugalso showed a good agreement with LUS and visual CT or MRI inspection in subsurface tumor localization. Importantly,Hepataugyields reproducible results. It is easy to use and could be deployed in any existing operating room.

WoS,Flow aggregation through dynamic routing overlaps in software defined networks,"There are huge amounts of flows in a Software Defined Network (SDN) sharing limited flow table space in the Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) at each SDN switch. To improve TCAM efficiency for serving as many flows as possible, flow aggregation serves as a good method to overlap a set of flow routings onto a common link, such that those flows can be simultaneously handled by the same TCAM at a single SDN switch. This however leads to a larger transmission delay of the flows. To achieve a good tradeoff between flow table space and average transmission delay, in this paper we first propose an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to minimize the total cost based on proper cost definitions of those two conflicting factors. The proposed ILP assigns predefined weights to different flows for aggregation, where a weight gives the priority of a unique flow. Since the ILP method is not scalable for large network scenarios, we further propose a fast heuristic ORWFA (Overlapping Routing with Weighted Flow Aggregation) to achieve a near-optimal solution. Under the principle of High Weight Flow First (HWFF), ORWFA builds multiple spanning trees with flow destinations as the roots, and flows with different destinations are aggregated based on the corresponding spanning trees.

WoS,"Knowledge map of environmental crisis management based on keywords network and co-word analysis, 2005-2018","Currently, the whole world is facing various environmental crises, which have caused serious harm to human society. Environmental crisis management is extremely important in tackling environmental crises. A large number of scholars have conducted extensive research on environmental crisis management, but the knowledge map about the environmental crisis management research is unknown. Therefore, analyzing the spatial structure of environmental crisis management not only helps to understand the specific distribution of the research paradigm of environmental crisis management but is also helpful in understanding the important topics. Based on the Web of Science (WOS) database. The software of NoteExpress, Bibexcel, and Ucinet and the analysis methods of social network (SN), K-core, co-word analysis, and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) were employed to explore the spatial structure of keywords in environmental crisis management literature. The study revealed that climate change is the hotspot of environmental crisis management. Moreover, the five main research topics on environmental crisis management have been identified, which are, respectively, different types of environmental crisis, the impact areas of the environmental crisis, the governance of environmental crisis, the application of technology in environmental crisis management, the characteristics of environmental crisis, and micro-governance. The spatial structure in the research field of environmental crisis management can be divided into application of environmental crisis management technology, management practice of environmental crisis, specific types of environmental crisis, and management theory of environmental crisis management. Finally, this study puts forward four research topics which should be attached importantly in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,An environmentally conscious photovoltaic supply chain network design under correlated uncertainty: A case study in Iran,"As the destructive impacts of unbridled use of fossil fuels threaten the quality of life, moving towards renewable energy like solar power has precipitated. While such movements are commendable, environmental impacts of its infrastructure development should not be overlooked. In this sense, this paper addresses a multi-objective robust mathematical model to study an environmentally conscious solar photovoltaic supply chain under correlated uncertainty. The proposed model aims at minimizing the environmental impacts of included activities in the concerned supply chain in addition to minimizing the conventional cost objective. To quantify and assess the relevant environmental impacts, a life cycle assessment-based model is accomplished employing the ReCiPe 2008 approach embedded in the SimaPro software tool. The augmented epsilon-constraint procedure is deployed to optimize the proposed multi-objective model, which is able to attain compromise solutions from the Pareto-optimal set. Correlated uncertainty whose importance is underlined in the real-life situations of the photovoltaic industry is also tackled exploiting a robust optimization method. Ultimately, the validity of the presented model is vindicated through discussing a case study. The acquired results endorse the effectiveness and usefulness of the model and offer prominent practical and managerial insights. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Experimental and numerical investigation on the deflection behavior of pre-cracked and repaired reinforced concrete beams with fiber-reinforced polymer,"This paper presents an experimental and numerical study on the effect of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets/laminates on the flexural deflection of pre-cracked and repaired reinforced concrete (RC) beams. The experimental program was aimed at studying the carrying capacity of repaired beams through load-deflection curves along with failure modes which can occur in unrepaired and repaired RC beams. The types of FRP reinforcement (CFRP sheet, GFRP sheet and CFRP laminate) and the number of FRP layers were selected as two main parameters in the test program. The major code models, namely Eurocode 2, the ACI-318 and the BS-8110 are used for evaluation of ultimate moment, and the results are also compared with experiments ones. Finite element analysis (FEA) using ANSYS software is presented to predict the load-deflection behavior of the RC beams, and completed with a numerical analysis to assess the interfacial shear stresses, focusing on debonding failure. The experimental results show an improvement in the ultimate load capacity of repaired RC beams with FRP ranging from 13% to 100%, with lower midspan deflections ranging from 15% to 35% as compared to the control beam (without FRP). On the other hand, the major code models could not accurately predict the moment capacity of RC beams strengthened with FRP sheets/laminates, with a gap closer to 1.40. Moreover, the numerical FEA predictions show a good agreement in the load-deflection response for all tested beams. Also, the numerical analysis results indicate that the shear stresses rise with the number of FRP sheets layers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Use of machine learning based technique to X-ray microtomographic images of concrete for phase segmentation at meso-scale,"The paper discusses the technical limitation of the gray value thresholding technique to detect the voids, aggregate and mortar phases. A two-stage image processing methodology is proposed for the segmentation of the three phases of concrete using the X-ray microtomographic images. In the first stage, the gray value thresholding technique is used to detect the voids. A machine learning based technique is proposed in the second stage for the segmentation of aggregate and mortar. The training data is used to model a planar decision boundary using the logistic regression method. For this, the radial distance from the centre of the image, gray value, and gray value of the filtered embossed image features are considered. The accuracy of the model to quantify the voids is validated with the commercial software. The machine learning model based on logistic regression method exhibits very good accuracy (approximate to 95%) in detecting the aggregate. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Genetic variations of CARMN affect risk of esophageal cancer in northwest China,"Background: As one of the common malignant tumors, esophageal cancer has significant heterogeneity in morbidity and mortality between gender, geographic distribution, race and histology. We used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to identify disease-related alleles, and to explore the relationship between gene variations and esophageal cancer susceptibility in northwest China. Methods: Six candidate SNPs (rs13177623, rs12654195, rs11168100, rs353303, rs353300, rs353299) selected from cancer related gene Cardiac mesoderm enhancer-associated non-coding RNA (CARMN) were genotyped by Agena MassARRAY platform. SPSS 18.0 software was used for logistic regression analysis of genotyping results, and Haploview 4.2 software was utilized for linage disequilibrium (LD) analysis. Results: We observed a significant association between genotype TT of rs353299 and the decreasing esophageal cancer risk (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.18-0.97, p = 0.042). The stratified analysis revealed that the influence of three CARMN polymorphisms (rs11168100, rs353300 and rs353299) on esophageal cancer risk is age-, gender-, smoking-, drinking- and lymph node metastasis status- dependent (p < 0.05). Haplotype analysis results indicated that T(rs11168100)A(rs353303)T(rs353300)C(rs353299) acts as a protective factor of esophageal cancer with OR of 0.71 (95% CI = 0.52-0.98, p = 0.038), while A(rs11168100)G(rs353303)C(rs353300) and A(rs11168100)A(rs353303) have 1.49-fold (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.02-2.19, p = 0.041) and 1.57-fold (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.05-2.35, p = 0.027) increased risk of esophageal cancer, respectively.

WoS,Food Acquisition Behaviors and Perceptions of Food Pantry Use among Food Pantry Clients in Rural Appalachia,"Rates of food insecurity vary highly across and within regions in the U.S., with rural Appalachia having higher rates compared to the rest of the country, leading parts of the population to rely on food pantries as a source of food. This article explores how food pantries fit into a broader scope of food acquisition strategies of rural Appalachian households and aims to contextualize this with an understanding of how food pantry users perceive their food pantry use. Semi-structured interviews (n=20) were conducted with food pantry users in Eastern Tennessee, followed by a survey for collection of demographic data. NVivo 11.4 software was used for thematic analysis and theory formulation. In addition to pantry use, participants reported reliance on grocery stores, and reciprocal, informal, food-sharing social networks to get food. Lack of transportation, insufficient food quantity, and other factors depleted participants' food resources. Food stretching, refusing to waste food, acceptability of food pantry food, and money-saving strategies enhanced participants' food resources. Food pantries are a consistent, but not the only food source for those who use them.

WoS,Numerical simulation of DPF thermal regeneration process based on an improved dynamic model,"In this paper, an improved kinetics model of soot oxidation based on the traditional B-K model is employed to characterize the thermal regeneration process of diesel particulate filters (DPF). Considering the influence of specific surface area and inhibition factor on soot oxidation, the regeneration process is simulated and analyzed using the commercial FLUENT software combined with UDF method. The results show that soot particles react from the middle of the filter to both ends, and the temporal profile of soot mass in the thermal regeneration process could be divided into three sections: smooth reaction, rapid reaction, and late reaction. The regeneration time decreases with the increasing of the incoming oxygen volume fraction. When the thickness of the deposited soot layer is less than 0.1 mm, the regeneration time is prolonged as the thickness of the deposited layer decreases. When the thickness is more than 0.1 mm, the regeneration time shows the opposite trend with the thickness of the deposited layer. Meanwhile, the curve of maximum wall temperature changing with time is divided into heating, rapid-burning, and slow-burning regimes. The maximum wall temperature increases as the volume fraction of oxygen flow increases, and as the deposited layer thickness increases.",DPF (Diesel Particular Filter); regeneration; soot oxidation; simulation,"Liu, BX; Sun, P; Aggarwal, S; Liu, SJ; Liu, JH",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY,10.1080/15435075.2020.1791876,"[Liu, Bingxia; Sun, Ping; Liu, Junheng] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Automobile & Traff Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bingxia; Liu, Shaojun] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Aggarwal, Suresh] Univ Illinois, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,English,1543-5075,

WoS,"Large-scale connectivity, cryptic population structure, and relatedness in Eastern Pacific Olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea)","Endangered species are grouped into genetically discrete populations to direct conservation efforts. Mitochondrial control region (mtCR) haplotypes are used to elucidate deep divergences between populations, as compared to nuclear microsatellites that can detect recent structuring. When prior populations are unknown, it is useful to subject microsatellite data to clustering and/or ordination population inference. Olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) are the most abundant sea turtle, yet few studies have characterized olive ridley population structure. Recently, clustering results of olive ridleys in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean suggested weak structuring (F-ST = 0.02) between Mexico and Central America. We analyzed mtCR haplotypes, new microsatellite genotypes from Costa Rica, and preexisting microsatellite genotypes from olive ridleys across the Eastern Tropical Pacific, to further explore population structuring in this region. We subjected inferred populations to multiple analyses to explore the mechanisms behind their structuring. We found 10 mtCR haplotypes from 60 turtles nesting at three sites in Costa Rica, but did not detect divergence between Costa Rican sites, or between Central America and Mexico. In Costa Rica, clustering suggested one population with no structuring, but ordination suggested four cryptic clusters with moderate structuring (F-ST = 0.08,p < .001). Across the Eastern Tropical Pacific, ordination suggested nine cryptic clusters with moderate structuring (F-ST = 0.103,p < .001) that largely corresponded to Mexican and Central American populations. All ordination clusters displayed significant internal relatedness relative to global relatedness (p < .001) and contained numerous sibling pairs. This suggests that broadly dispersed family lineages have proliferated in Eastern Tropical Pacific olive ridleys and corroborates previous work showing basin-wide connectivity and shallow population structure in this region. The existence of broadly dispersed kin in Eastern Tropical Pacific olive ridleys has implications for management of olive ridleys in this region, and adds to our understanding of sea turtle ecology and life history, particularly in light of the natal-homing paradigm.",bottleneck; conservation genetics; haplotypes; kin; marine connectivity; ordination; sea turtle,"Silver-Gorges, I; Koval, J; Rodriguez-Zarate, CJ; Paladino, FV; Jordan, M",2020.0,JournalEA,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,10.1002/ece3.6564,"[Silver-Gorges, Ian; Koval, Julianne; Paladino, Frank, V; Jordan, Mark] Purdue Univ Ft Wayne, Ctr Marine Conservat & Biol, Dept Biol, Ft Wayne, IN USA; [Rodriguez-Zarate, Clara J.] Emirates Nat Assoc World Wide Fund Nat WWF, Marine Turtle Conservat Programme, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",WILEY,English,2045-7758,
WoS,Is there a correlation between fragility fractures of the pelvis (FFP) and the morphology of the true pelvis in geriatric patients?,"Purpose There has been no prior study to demonstrate the relationship between the occurrence of fragility fractures of the pelvis and its morphology. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pelvic morphology on fragility fractures of the pelvis caused by low-energy trauma in elderly female patients. Materials and methods As a normal pelvis group, 643 female patients over 65 years of age who underwent pelvic CT were collected. Using three-dimensional multiplanar reconstruction (3D-MPR) function of RadiAnt software, the DT (diameter of transverse true pelvis)/DS (diameter of sagittal true pelvis) values of normal pelvis were measured. Sorted in ascending order, the mean DT/DS value of normal pelvis was 1.13 +/- 0.09. The values corresponding to the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile were 1.06 and 1.18, respectively. We arbitrarily named DT/DS values of 1.06 or less corresponding to lower than 25th percentile as 'Circle types', and DT/DS values of 1.18 or higher corresponding to higher than 75th percentile as 'Ellipse types'. Total of 76 female patients over 65 years of age who underwent 3D reconstructions of pelvic CT scans with fragility fractures of the pelvis, who fell into the criteria corresponding to FFP classification type II, were studied separately. Of the 76 female FFPs, two were FFP type IIa, 32 were FFP type IIb, and 42 were FFP type IIc. Their DT/DS was measured. Results Based on the above mentioned criteria, we classified the pelvis shape of 76 patients with fragility fracture of the pelvis type II. 33 patients (43.4%) were classified as circle types and eight patients (10.5%) were classified as ellipse types. The odds ratio of circle type for fragility fractures of pelvis type II was 4.1. Conclusion With digital reconstruction and 3D measurement of normal adult pelvic CT scans, this study obtained a series of DT/DS values describing the shape of true pelvises.

WoS,Discovery-based analysis and quantification for comprehensive three-dimensional gas chromatography flame ionization detection data,"Basic principles are introduced for implementing discovery-based analysis with automated quantification of data obtained using comprehensive three-dimensional gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC(3)-FID). The GC(3)-FID instrument employs dynamic pressure gradient modulation, providing full modulation (100% duty cycle) with a fast modulation period (PM) of 100 ms. Specifically, tile-based Fisher-ratio analysis, previously developed for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), is adapted and applied for GC(3)-FID where the third chromatographic dimension (D-3) is treated as the spectral dimension. To evaluate the instrumental platform and software implementation, ten non-native compounds were spiked into a ninety-component base mixture to create two classes with a concentration ratio of two for the spiked analyte compounds. The Fisher ratio software identified 95 locations of potential interest (i.e., hits), with all ten spiked analytes discovered within the top fourteen hits. All 95 hits were quantified by a novel signal ratio (S-ratio) algorithm portion of the F-ratio software, which determines the time-dependent S-ratio of the D-3 chromatograms from one class to another, thus providing relative quantification. The average S-ratio for spiked analytes was 1.94 +/- 0.14 mean absolute error (close to the nominal concentration ratio of two), and 1.06 +/- 0.16 mean absolute error for unspiked (i.e., matrix) components. The appearance of the S-ratio as a function of D-3 retention time in the GC(3) dataset, referred to as an S-ratiogram, provides indication of peak purity for each hit. The unique shape of the S-ratiogram for hit 1, alpha-pinene, suggested likely D-3 overlap. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) decomposition of the hit location confirmed that overlap was occurring and successfully decomposed alpha-pinene from a highly overlapped (R-3(s) = 0.1) matrix interferent.

Seventy early maturing provitamin A (PVA) quality protein maize (QPM) inbreds developed by the IITA- maize improvement programme were genotyped using 8171 DArTseq markers. Furthermore, 96 hybrids derived from 24 selected inbreds plus four checks were evaluated under low-N and optimal environments in Nigeria during 2016 and 2017. Genotypic and phenotypic data of inbreds and hybrids respectively, were analysed to (i) assess the level of genetic dissimilarities and population structure of the inbreds, and (ii) investigate the grain yield performance of derived hybrids under low-N, optimal and across environments. Results Genetic diversity among the seventy inbreds was high varying from 0.042 to 0.500 with an average of 0.357. Sixty-six inbred lines with probabilities >= 0.70 were assigned to a single group. The population structure analysis, the UPGMA phylogeny, and the principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of the DArTseq markers revealed a clear separation of five groups and each followed pedigree records. Clustered inbreds displayed common characteristics including high PVA levels, and drought and low-N tolerance. The top performing hybrid, TZEIORQ 40 x TZEIORQ 26 out-yielded the best hybrid control, TZEIOR 127 x TZEIOR 57 by 8, 3, and 9% under low-N, optimal, and across environments, respectively. High repeatability estimates were detected for grain yield under each and across environments. Similarly, high breeding efficiency of 71, 70 and 72% were computed under low-N, optimal, and across environments, respectively. Conclusions The UPGMA clustering, the structure analysis, and the PCoA consistently revealed five groups which largely followed pedigree information indicating the existence of genetically distinct groups in the inbred lines. High repeatability and breeding efficiency values estimated for grain yield of hybrids under low-N, optimal and across environments demonstrated that high productive hybrids could be developed using inbreds from the opposing clusters identified by the DArTseq markers. The 15 top performing hybrids identified, particularly TZEIORQ 40 x TZEIORQ 26 and TZEIORQ 29 x TZEIORQ 43 should be further evaluated for release and commercialization in SSA.",Genetic diversity; DArTseq markers; Provitamin A; Quality protein maize; Low-N tolerance; Inbred lines; Hybrids; Zea maysL,"Obeng-Bio, E; Badu-Apraku, B; Ifie, BE; Danquah, A; Blay, ET; Abu Dadzie, M; Noudifoule, GT; Talabi, AO",2020.0,Journal,BMC GENETICS,10.1186/s12863-020-00887-7,"[Obeng-Bio, Ebenezer] CSIR Crops Res Inst, POB 3785, Kumasi, Ghana; [Badu-Apraku, Baffour; Talabi, Abidemi Olutayo] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, PMB 5320,Oyo Rd, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Ifie, Beatrice Elohor; Danquah, Agyemang; Blay, Essie Takyiwaa] Univ Ghana, West Africa Ctr Crop Improvement WACCI, PBM 30 Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Abu Dadzie, Mustapha] Cocoa Res Inst, POB 8, New Tafo Akim, Ghana; [Noudifoule, Gilbert Tchala] Inst Togolais Rech Agron ITRA, BP 1163, Lome, Togo",BMC,English,1471-2156,
WoS,FluConvert and IniFlu: a suite of integrated software to identify novel signatures of emerging influenza viruses with increasing risk,"Background: The pandemic threat of influenza has attracted great attention worldwide. To assist public health decision-makers, new suites of tools are needed to rapidly process and combine viral information retrieved from public-domain databases for a better risk assessment. Results: Using our recently developed FluConvert and IniFlu software, we automatically processed and rearranged sequence data by standard viral nomenclature, determined the group-related consensus sequences, and identified group-specific polygenic signatures. The software possesses powerful ability to integrate viral, clinical, and epidemiological data. We demonstrated that both multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of the HA gene and also at least 11 more evidence-based viral amino acid substitutions present in global highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 viruses during the years 2009-2016 that are associated with viral virulence and human infection. Conclusions: FluConvert and IniFlu are useful to monitor and assess all subtypes of influenza viruses with pandemic potential. These programs are implemented through command-line and user-friendly graphical interfaces, and identify molecular signatures with virological, epidemiological and clinical significance.

WoS,Evaluation of the seismic response of the slopes in the presence of the horseshoe tunnel,"Recent researches indicated that the topography is one of the factors affecting the wave propagation pattern (i.e., the amplification or de-amplification). In recent years, many researchers investigated the effect of the tunnels on the wave propagation pattern in the free-field. Although in the construction of the roads in mountainous areas, tunneling for passing through slopes is unavoidable, the role of the tunnel in seismic behavior of slopes has been less concerned. In this study, the structural behavior of the tunnel lining and the amplification pattern in slopes in the presence of horseshoe tunnels, subjected to Ricker incident in-plane shear wave (SV), has been evaluated using the ABAQUS software. Several parameters affecting this phenomenon are accounted for such as the overburden, the distance of tunnels from the slope surface, and the dip angle of slope and bedrock. Results show that the presence of the horseshoe tunnels has a significant effect on the seismic response of the slopes. In comparison to the free-field, the amplitude of the seismic response was increased approximately 30 and 70% for the upstream and the inclined surface of the slope, respectively.",Amplification; Soil slope; Horseshoe tunnel; Wave propagation pattern; SV wave,"Mashhadban, H; Choobbasti, AJ; Shooshpasha, I; Ashtiani, M",2020.0,JournalEA,BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,10.1007/s10064-020-01920-w,"[Mashhadban, Hadi; Choobbasti, Asskar Janalizadeh; Shooshpasha, Issa; Ashtiani, Mehdi] Babol Noshirvani Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Babol Sar, Iran",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1435-9529,
WoS,Test-retest validation of a cranial deformity index in unilateral coronal craniosynostosis,"Unilateral coronal craniosynostosis (UCS) affects many infants resulting in abnormalities affecting the forehead and orbits. As a result, the deformity caused by UCS is very noticeable and there are several surgical treatment options available to normalize the head shape. However, there is a lack of consistently used outcome measures, resulting in difficulty assessing surgical outcomes and on-going debate over optimal treatments. Current techniques to quantify deformity in UCS are cumbersome, provide limited information, or are based on subjective assessments. In this study, a cranial deformity index was developed to quantify abnormality at the frontal bones for UCS that is accessible, user-friendly, and generates objective surface distance measurements. The cranial deformity index is defined as the Euclidean distance at the point of the largest deviation between the deformed skull compared to a reference skull. In addition, the index was successfully used to quantify post-operative changes in a single case of UCS that underwent corrective surgery. The reproducibility of the index was assessed using test-retest reliability and was demonstrated to be highly reproducible (ICC = 0.93). A user-friendly measurement index that is based on open-source software may be a valuable tool for surgical teams. In addition, this information can augment the consultation experience for patients and their families.",Craniosynostosis; unicoronal synostosis; craniofacial; pediatric; surgery; outcome measurement; cranial vault remodelling; 3D,"Robertson, E; Kwan, P; Louie, G; Boulanger, P; Aalto, D",2020.0,JournalEA,COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,10.1080/10255842.2020.1795143,"[Robertson, Emilie; Kwan, Peter; Louie, Gorman] Univ Alberta, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Boulanger, Pierre] Univ Alberta, Dept Comp Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Robertson, Emilie; Aalto, Daniel] Univ Alberta, Fac Rehabil Med, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Robertson, Emilie; Aalto, Daniel] Misericordia Community Hosp, Inst Reconstruct Sci Med, Edmonton, AB, Canada",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,English,1025-5842,
WoS,Causal Inference With Interference and Noncompliance in Two-Stage Randomized Experiments,"In many social science experiments, subjects often interact with each other and as a result one unit's treatment influences the outcome of another unit. Over the last decade, a significant progress has been made toward causal inference in the presence of such interference between units. Researchers have shown that the two-stage randomization of treatment assignment enables the identification of average direct and spillover effects. However, much of the literature has assumed perfect compliance with treatment assignment. In this article, we establish the nonparametric identification of the complier average direct and spillover effects in two-stage randomized experiments with interference and noncompliance. In particular, we consider the spillover effect of the treatment assignment on the treatment receipt as well as the spillover effect of the treatment receipt on the outcome. We propose consistent estimators and derive their randomization-based variances under the stratified interference assumption. We also prove the exact relationships between the proposed randomization-based estimators and the popular two-stage least squares estimators. The proposed methodology is motivated by and applied to our own randomized evaluation of India's National Health Insurance Program (RSBY), where we find some evidence of spillover effects. The proposed methods are implemented via an open-source software package.for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.",Complier average causal effects; Encouragement design; Program evaluation; Randomization inference; Spillover effects; Two-stage least squares,"Imai, K; Jiang, ZC; Malaniam, A",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION,10.1080/01621459.2020.1775612,"[Imai, Kosuke] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Dept Govt & Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jiang, Zhichao] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Malaniam, Anup] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Law Sch, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Malaniam, Anup] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,English,0162-1459,
WoS,The effects of game-based learning in the acquisition of soft skills on undergraduate software engineering courses: A systematic literature review,"The software industry is becoming an increasingly important part of the economy in countries that have realized that the education of future software engineers is crucial to having a vibrant software industry. However, software engineering education is still influenced by traditional teaching impeding the acquisition of soft skills. Game-based learning (GBL) combines learning with different known resources, such as games, to support and improve the teaching/learning process and/or student evaluation through active learning. This study presents a systematic literature review on the use of GBL for teaching software engineering at the undergraduate level, from 2001 to 2020, by addressing four research questions: What kinds of games have been developed for software engineering education? Which software engineering areas have been addressed by these games? Which soft skills have been promoted by using these games? How have these skills been evaluated? The study found 96 studies to answer these four questions. The findings provided evidence on the development of digital games focused on teaching the fundamentals of software engineering defined by software engineering body of knowledge. Moreover, these games have been able to promote the acquisition of more than one soft skill which is beneficial for undergraduate students.",game-based learning; software engineering education; systematic literature review,"Garcia, I; Pacheco, C; Mendez, F; Calvo-Manzano, JA",2020.0,ReviewEA,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,10.1002/cae.22304,"[Garcia, Ivan; Pacheco, Carla; Mendez, Francisco] Univ Tecnol Mixteca, Div Estudios Posgrad, Oaxaca, Mexico; [Calvo-Manzano, Jose A.] Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingenieros Informat, Sch Comp Engn, Madrid, Spain",WILEY,English,1061-3773,
WoS,Standing on shoulders or feet? An extended study on the usage of the MSR data papers,"The establishment of the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) data showcase conference track has encouraged researchers to provide data sets as a basis for further empirical studies. The objective of this study is to examine the usage of data papers published in the MSR proceedings in terms of use frequency, users, and use purpose. Data track papers were collected from the MSR data showcase track and through the manual inspection of older MSR proceedings. The use of data papers was established through manual citation searching followed by reading the citing studies and dividing them into strong and weak citations. Contrary to weak, strong citations truly use the data set of a data paper. Data papers were then manually clustered based on their content, whereas their strong citations were classified by hand according to the knowledge areas of the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge. A survey study on 108 authors and users of data papers provided further insights regarding motivation and effort in data paper production, encouraging and discouraging factors in data set use, and future desired direction regarding data papers. We found that 65% of the data papers have been used in other studies, with a long-tail distribution in the number of strong citations. Weak citations to data papers usually refer to them as an example. MSR data papers are cited in total less than other MSR papers. A considerable number of the strong citations stem from the teams that authored the data papers. Publications providing Version Control System (VCS) primary and derived data are the most frequent data papers and the most often strongly cited ones. Enhanced developer data papers are the least common ones, and the second least frequently strongly cited. Data paper authors tend to gather data in the context of other research. Users of data sets appreciate high data quality and are discouraged by lack of replicability of data set construction. Data related to machine learning or derived from the manufacturing sector are two suggestions of the respondents for future data papers. Overall, data papers have provided the foundation for a significant number of studies, but there is room for improvement in their utilization. This can be done by setting a higher bar for their publication, by encouraging their use, by promoting open science initiatives, and by providing incentives for the enrichment of existing data collections.",Software engineering data; Bibliometrics; Survey study; Mining software repositories; Data paper; Reproducibility,"Kotti, Z; Kravvaritis, K; Dritsa, K; Spinellis, D",2020.0,JournalEA,EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,10.1007/s10664-020-09834-7,"[Kotti, Zoe; Kravvaritis, Konstantinos; Dritsa, Konstantina; Spinellis, Diomidis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Management Sci & Technol, 76 Patiss St, Athens 10434, Greece",SPRINGER,English,1382-3256,

WoS,Machine Learning for 3D Particle Tracking in Granular Gases,"Dilute ensembles of granular matter (so-called granular gases) are nonlinear systems which exhibit fascinating dynamical behavior far from equilibrium, including non-Gaussian distributions of velocities and rotational velocities, clustering, and violation of energy equipartition. In order to understand their dynamic properties, microgravity experiments were performed in suborbital flights and drop tower experiments. Up to now, the experimental images were evaluated mostly manually. Here, we introduce an approach for automatic 3D tracking of positions and orientations of rod-like particles in a dilute ensemble, based on two-view video data analysis. A two-dimensional (2D) localization of particles is performed using a Mask R-CNN neural network trained on a custom data set. The problem of 3D matching of the particles is solved by minimization of the total reprojection error, and finally, particle trajectories are tracked so that ensemble statistics are extracted. Depending on the required accuracy, the software can work fully self-sustainingly or serve as a base for subsequent manual corrections. The approach can be extended to other 3D and 2D particle tracking problems.",Machine learning; Granular gas; Particle tracking; Object detection; Mask-CNN,"Puzyrev, D; Harth, K; Trittel, T; Stannarius, R",2020.0,JournalEA,MICROGRAVITY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,10.1007/s12217-020-09800-4,"[Puzyrev, Dmitry; Harth, Kirsten; Trittel, Torsten; Stannarius, Ralf] Otto von Guericke Univ, Inst Phys, Univ Pl 2, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany",SPRINGER,English,0938-0108,

Materials and methods A total of 80 CTP datasets from patients with AIS or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were retrospectively post-processed by two observers using different regions of interest (ROI) types, input models, and software. The CTP parameters were derived for 10 parenchymal ROIs. The intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the reproducibility of the CTP parameters for various post-processing methods. The Spearman correlation test was used to detect potential relationships between software and input models. Results The ICCs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.94 (0.93-0.96), 0.94 (0.92-0.96), 0.82 (0.79-0.86), and 0.87 (0.85-0.90) for inter-reader agreement by using elliptic ROI, irregular ROI, single-input model, and dual-input model, respectively. The ICCs with 95% CI were 0.98 (0.98-0.98), 0.46 (0.43-0.50), and 0.25 (0.20-0.30) for inter-ROI type, inter-input model, and inter-software agreement, respectively.

WoS,Graphene oxide/silver nanostructure as a green anti-biofouling composite toward controlling the microbial corrosion,"Microbiologically influenced corrosion is a serious problem in the oil and gas industry, which leads to both economical losses and environmental pollutions. To control biocorrosion and prevent the problems, using biocides is the main solution. Recently, nanomaterials have been introduced as a new generation of biocides to control the biocorrosion. In this study, graphene oxide/silver nanostructure was synthetized, and its biocidal effect was evaluated by a dose-response test. The response surface methodology in the Design-Expert software was used to analyze the result, and to determine the optimum concentration of nanostructure to inhibit sulfate reducing bacteria, which was 80 mg/L. The corrosion morphology and the composition of the formed corrosion products were studied using surface analysis methods. The result illustrated the uniform corrosion and significantly reduced amount of iron sulfide in the presence of nanostructure, due to the inhibition of sulfate reducing bacteria. In comparison, the pitting corrosion was observed on the surface of the exposed coupon to the bacteria, and the high presence of iron sulfide in the corrosion products. The corrosion behavior of steel in the presence of the bacteria and the nanostructure was investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarization techniques. Corrosion test result indicated that the addition of the nanostructure increased the charge transfer resistance, resulting in the reduction in corrosion rate.

WoS,Biochar is an effective amendment to remediate Cd-contaminated soils-a meta-analysis,"Purpose Cd immobilization can be affected by many factors, among which the soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), and amendment types are the most critical factors that have been considered in many previous studies. The objective of this study was to find the amendments with best performance for Cd remediation in soils with different range of soil pH and SOM. Materials and methods The effects of soil pH, SOM, and amendment types on soil Cd fractions and Cd uptake by rice were investigated by meta-analysis performed on MetaWin software, based on relevant data of 513 observations from 51 published papers that studied the soil fields in China from 2000 to 2020. Results and discussion Cd immobilization was more responsive to amendments when soil pH <= 6.0 as compared with those with pH higher than 6.0, which is probably because most amendments increased the soil pH and thus decreased the Cd activity. The Cd immobilization was most effective with the presence of 20-30 g/kg SOM; excessive SOM activated Cd in soil. Synthetic material appeared to be the most effective amendment on immobilization of the exchangeable fraction of Cd in soil by 42.5% inhibition rate. Biochar showed the strongest inhibition effect on the Cd uptake by rice (65.2% inhibition rate), while organic material exhibited the lowest immobilization effect. Conclusions We demonstrated that amendments showed best performance under conditions of soil pH <= 6.0 and SOM of 20-30 g/kg, and biochar is an effective amendment to remediate Cd-contaminated soils.

WoS,"The Simplified Ionospheric Regional Model (SIRM) for HF Prediction: Basic Theory, Its Evolution and Applications","This paper is a final review of the Simplified Ionospheric Regional Model (SIRM) developed as a prototype in the early 1990s and improved in the following years. By means of an algorithm based on the Fourier synthesis, the SIRM model in its prototype version provides predicted monthly median values of the main ionospheric characteristics such as: the ordinary wave critical frequencies (foE,foF1, andfoF2) of the E, F1, and F2 ionospheric layers; the lowest virtual height (h'F) of the ordinary trace of the F region; the obliquity factor for a distance of 3000 km (M(3000)F2). Instead, the improved version focuses only onfoF2 andM(3000)F2. The SIRM model has been largely employed in the framework of different international research projects as the climatological reference to outputfoF2 andM(3000)F2 monthly median predictions, but in its SIRMUP version is used also as a nowcasting model and as an intermediate step of complex procedures for a near real-time three-dimensional representation of the ionospheric electron density.

WoS,Bridging the gap between student instruction and advanced research: Educational software tool for manufacturing learning,"Currently, there is a big gap between industry and the instructions provided by engineers at the University. Manufacturing companies need engineers with specific profiles and skills in machining. Teachers, who face both worlds, must play an active role in shortening the transition times of students. Recently, barrel-end mills have been the focus of attention of toolmakers and manufacturers due to their excellent production times and surface accuracies. They are outstanding competitors to more traditional ball-end mills in some applications. This study raises the challenge of translating the developed work for this kind of tool from the research domain into the classroom at the University. For this, a software tool proBARR (c) was developed and used for learning of the subject of manufacturing. This educational software is capable of predicting cutting forces and surface topography in milling with barrel-end mills and was successfully introduced as part of the students' learning process. A software tool was created for the analysis and prediction of cutting forces and surface quality in milling processes with barrel-end mills. This specific problem was addressed from past experience in research projects but was then adapted for academic use. The teachers believe that, if suitably presented to students, the tool provides an excellent opportunity to approach real problems in industry, thus boosting instructions for future engineers. In this way, a pragmatic methodology to computational thinking is presented that transforms traditional difficulties associated with process modeling into more comprehensive tasks, more oriented toward solving specific problems.",advanced instruction; engineering research; learning manufacturing; simulation tool,"Urbikain, G; de Lacalle, LNL",2020.0,JournalEA,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,10.1002/cae.22305,"[Urbikain, Gorka; Lopez de Lacalle, Luis Norberto] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Mech Engn, CFAA, Plaza Europa 1, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain; [Lopez de Lacalle, Luis Norberto] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Dept Mech Engn, CFAA, Bilbao, Spain",WILEY,English,1061-3773,
WoS,Water leakage susceptible areas in loess multi-arch tunnel operation under the lateral recharge conditions,"In this study, the water leakage susceptible areas in a loess multi-arch tunnel were examined, providing a basis for the prevention and control of water leakage disease during the operation periods of multi-arch tunnels in loess areas. Through the field investigation of the leakage in loess multi-arch tunnel, the leakage mainly focuses on three joints: construction joints, expansion joints, and settlement joints. The spatial distribution of the leaking part in the tunnel is summarized and abstractly into three types: annular cracks, longitudinal cracks and full longitudinal cracks + circumferential cracks. By setting up different number of annular and longitudinal cracks, a total of 20 combinations were designed. This paper sets three kinds of working conditions, including 40 and 60 m of reinforcement water head and 60 m of no reinforcement water head, considering groundwater lateral recharge conditions. Using the midas/GTS geo-technical analysis system software, 3D numerical simulations were conducted to determine the distributions of the total water head and water pressure in cracks for all the combinations of water leakage positions under different working conditions and to analyze the variations in the seepage field of the surrounding rock. Based on the areas where the total water head and water pressure in the cracks sharply changed, the water leakage susceptible areas were determined. The rationality and reliability of the method were verified by a comparison with the results of a field investigation.",Tunnel engineering; Water leakage; Site investigation; Numerical simulation; Loess multiple-arch tunnel; Lateral recharge condition,"Mao, ZJ; Wang, XK; An, N; Li, XJ; Wei, RY; Wang, YQ; Wu, H",2020.0,Journal,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,10.1007/s12665-020-09083-3,"[Mao, Zhengjun; An, Ning; Li, Xiaojun; Wei, Rongyu] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Mao, Zhengjun] Shaanxi Prov Key Lab Geol Support Coal Green Expl, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Mao, Zhengjun; Wang, Xiaokang] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Geol Res Inst Coal Green Min, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Mao, Zhengjun; Wang, Yaqiong; Wu, Hao] Changan Univ, Shaanxi Prov Major Lab Highway Bridge & Tunnel, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yaqiong; Wu, Hao] Changan Univ, Sch Highway, Xian 710054, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,1866-6280,

WoS,Measurement of erosion depth using microcomputed tomography and light microscopy,"Tooth-erosion is the surface loss of dental hard tissue mostly associated with an acid attack. The aim was to compare dentin and enamel erosion depth measurements using micro-computed tomography (microCT) and light microscopy (LM). Enamel/dentin blocks were prepared from caries-free human molar-teeth (N= 12). Teeth were sectioned to a rectangular shape of 4 x 4 x 6 mm. Specimens were treated with water (NC) or 1.0% citric-acid solution (PC). After treatment, specimens were scanned with micro-computed tomography. On completion, specimens were sectioned and observed under a light-microscope. Lesion depth was observed with 10x magnification and images transferred to Simpleware software. Vertical distance from lesion surface to bottom was measured. Pearson correlation test was used to evaluate correlation and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test to evaluate differences in the two-analysis methods. Mean enamel erosion depth was 0.63 and 38.38 mu m (microCT) and 0.54 and 39.43 mu m (LM) for NC and PC, respectively. Dentin erosion depth was 0.72 and 48.05 mu m (microCT) and 0.56 and 49.92 mu m (LM) for NC and PC, respectively. There was a significant correlation between the two-analysis methods (r= 0.998;p < .001). No statistically significant difference in results were obtained when microCT and LM were compared (p= .584). This results obtained from the current study suggested that erosion depth measurements made using microCT and LM yielded comparable results.

WoS,Water tunnel study of a cantilever flexible plate in the wake of a square cylinder,"The vorticity in the wake flow behind bluff bodies can be used to generate undulating motion of polymeric flexible plates. When the plates carry piezoelectric cells, the strain energy resulting from flapping can be converted into electricity. The undulating motion of cantilevered plates in the wake of a bluff body has been described in a few studies; less information was given on the flow pattern and fewer on the influence of the geometric parameters. In this study, a polyethylene terephthalate thin plate was clamped to a square cylinder and placed in a water tunnel and the Reynolds number based on the square cylinder was set from around 1500 to 20,000. The plate deflection and related flow pattern were captured at both 5000 and 500 frames per second using two different high speed cameras. Modal decomposition, strain energy and flapping power calculation were carried out from the deflection data. The flow vectors were computed using the particle image velocimetry software PIVlab. Strain energy is maximized when higher order modeshapes occur which is only the case for longer plates because of the lower natural frequencies resulting in an increased plate-wake interaction. The plate width is an important parameter as wider plates witness strain energy wastage owing to torsion and plates that are too narrow undergo out of plane bending. Longer plates yield greater power output as long as the bending pattern is kept two-dimensional. The strain nodes have a more significant shift in positions along the beam for longer plates. This may result in significant charge cancellation within the piezoelectric cells.",,"Binyet, E; Huang, CY; Chang, JY",2020.0,JournalEA,MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS,10.1007/s00542-020-04901-x,"[Binyet, Emmanuel; Huang, Chih-Yung; Chang, Jen-Yuan] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Power Mech Engn, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,0946-7076,
WoS,Multiple glacial refugia and contemporary dispersal shape the genetic structure of an endemic amphibian from the Pyrenees,"Historical factors (colonization scenarios, demographic oscillations) and contemporary processes (population connectivity, current population size) largely contribute to shaping species' present-day genetic diversity and structure. In this study, we use a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers to understand the role of Quaternary climatic oscillations and present-day gene flow dynamics in determining the genetic diversity and structure of the newtCalotriton asper(Al. Duges, 1852), endemic to the Pyrenees. Mitochondrial DNA did not show a clear phylogeographic pattern and presented low levels of variation. In contrast, microsatellites revealed five major genetic lineages with admixture patterns at their boundaries. Approximate Bayesian computation analyses and linear models indicated that the five lineages likely underwent separate evolutionary histories and can be tracked back to distinct glacial refugia. Lineage differentiation started around the Last Glacial Maximum at three focal areas (western, central and eastern Pyrenees) and extended through the end of the Last Glacial Period in the central Pyrenees, where it led to the formation of two more lineages. Our data revealed no evidence of recent dispersal between lineages, whereas borders likely represent zones of secondary contact following expansion from multiple refugia. Finally, we did not find genetic evidence of sex-biased dispersal. This work highlights the importance of integrating past evolutionary processes and present-day gene flow and dispersal dynamics, together with multilocus approaches, to gain insights into what shaped the current genetic attributes of amphibians living in montane habitats.",Calotriton; genetic structure; phylogeographic history; Pyrenean brook newt; Pyrenees; recent dispersal,"Lucati, F; Poignet, M; Miro, A; Trochet, A; Aubret, F; Barthe, L; Bertrand, R; Buchaca, T; Calvez, O; Caner, J; Darnet, E; Denoel, M; Guillaume, O; Le Chevalier, H; Martinez-Silvestre, A; Mossoll-Torres, M; O'Brien, D; Osorio, V; Pottier, G; Richard, M; Sabas, I; Souchet, J; Tomas, J; Ventura, M",2020.0,JournalEA,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,10.1111/mec.15521,"[Lucati, Federica] Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes cE3c, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lucati, Federica; Miro, Alexandre; Buchaca, Teresa; Caner, Jenny; Osorio, Victor; Sabas, Ibor; Tomas, Jan; Ventura, Marc] Ctr Adv Studies Blanes CEAB CSIC, Blanes, Spain; [Poignet, Manon; Trochet, Audrey; Aubret, Fabien; Bertrand, Romain; Calvez, Olivier; Darnet, Elodie; Guillaume, Olivier; Le Chevalier, Hugo; Richard, Murielle; Souchet, Jeremie] Univ Paul Sabatier, CNRS, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt SETE, Moulis, France; [Trochet, Audrey] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Soc Herpetol France, Paris, France; [Barthe, Laurent; Pottier, Gilles] Assoc Nat Occitanie, Maison Environm Midi Pyrenees, Toulouse, France; [Denoel, Mathieu] Univ Liege, Lab Ecol & Conservat Amphibians LECA, Freshwater & OCean Sci Unit reS FOCUS, Liege, Belgium; [Martinez-Silvestre, Albert] Catalonia Reptile & Amphibian Rescue Ctr CRARC, Masquefa, Spain; [Mossoll-Torres, Marc] Pirenalia, Encamp, Andorra; [Mossoll-Torres, Marc] Bomosa, Les Escaldes, Andorra; [O'Brien, David] Scottish Nat Heritage, Inverness, Scotland",WILEY,English,0962-1083,

WoS,Automatic Thresholding Technique Using Reconfigurable Hardware,"This research presents an efficient automatic thresholding technique based on Otsu's method that can be used in edge detection algorithms and then applied as a plug-in for real-time image processing devices. The proposed thresholding technique uses an iterative clustering based method that targets a reduced number of operations. It is well known that the Otsu calculates the global threshold splitting the image into two classes, foreground and background, and choose the threshold that minimizes the interclass variance of the threshold black and white pixels. In this paper, a faster version of Otsu's method is proposed knowing that the only pixels that have to be moved from one class to another class are the ones with values in between the previous two thresholds. This procedure yields the same set of thresholds as the original method but the redundant computation has been removed and, in this way, only few operations are required. The proposed thresholding technique has been implemented in software using C# programing language and in reconfigurable hardware on a Spartan 3E XC3S500E FPGA board using VHDL. The results obtained, presented for different digital images, confirm that the proposed iterative thresholding algorithm and architecture on FPGA can achieve the requirements to be included in real-time image processing systems.",Cluster based methods; edge detection; FPGA; image binarization; Otsu's method; thresholding algorithms,"Anghelescu, P",2020.0,JournalEA,CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS,10.1080/01969722.2020.1804220,"[Anghelescu, Petre] Univ Pitesti, Dept Elect Commun & Comp, Pitesti 0300, Arges, Romania",TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,English,0196-9722,
WoS,A novel strategy for frequency control of islanded greenhouse with cooperative usage of BESS and LED lighting loads,"In microgrid perspective, a greenhouse (GH) can exchange power with the utility grid in the grid-connected mode or operate autonomously in the islanded mode. In this paper, a two-stage control strategy for the frequency control of the islanded greenhouse is proposed. The first stage is primary frequency control (PFC) that battery energy storage system (BESS) and LED lighting loads (LEDLLs) intercept the frequency deviation in a coordinated manner. BESS can inject or absorb power and LEDLLs also can decrease or increase their power consumption, respectively, for shortage or surplus power situations. One of the novelties of this paper is to use this capability of LEDLLs for participation in PFC, which is very suitable and useful since they are the major load in the GH. Also, the dimmable capability of LEDLLs is used for changing their power consumption to avoid unwanted and extreme frequency deviations in the islanded mode. The second stage is the secondary frequency control (SFC) that the slow responding diesel generators (DEGs) gradually change their output power to reestablish load-generation balance and consequently, restore frequency to its nominal value. Also, a novel strategy for emergency frequency restoration with the cooperation of the BESS and the LEDLLs is proposed for situations that DEGs alongside other DGs in the greenhouse cannot provide the power of total GH loads. Several case studies are performed on a GH under study by simulation in MATLAB/Simulink software that the results show the effectiveness of proposed control strategy.",Greenhouse; Islanded mode; PFC; BESS; SFC; LEDLL,"Sanjareh, MB; Nazari, MH; Hosseinian, SH",2020.0,JournalEA,ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING,10.1007/s00202-020-01077-5,"[Bagheri Sanjareh, Mehrdad] Shahid Beheshti Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Nazari, Mohammad Hassan; Hosseinian, Seyed Hossein] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran",SPRINGER,English,0948-7921,

WoS,Privacy and security constraints for code contributions,"In collaborative software development, developers submit their contributions to repositories that are used to integrate code from various collaborators. To avoid privacy and security issues, code contributions are often reviewed before integration. Although careful manual code review can detect such issues, it might be time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. Automatic analysis tools can also detect privacy and security issues, but they often demand significant developer effort, or are domain specific, considering fixed framework specific vulnerability sources and sinks. To reduce these problems, in this paper we propose the Salvum policy language to support the specification of constraints that help to protect sensitive information from being inadvertently accessed by specific code contributions. We implement a tool that automatically checks Salvum policies for systems of different technical domains. We also investigate whether Salvum can find policy violations for a number of open-source projects.

Success of software in hospitals may be dependent on prescriber uptake of software recommendations. This study aimed to identify the perceived psychosocial and environmental barriers and facilitators to prescriber acceptance of dose-prediction software. Methods Semi-structured interviews, incorporating prescribing scenarios, were undertaken with 17 prescribers. Participants were asked to prescribe the next maintenance dose of vancomycin for a scenario(s) and then asked if they would accept a recommendation provided by a dose-prediction software. Interviews further explored opinions of dose-prediction software. Interview transcripts were analysed using an inductive approach to identify themes and the Theoretical Domains Framework was used to synthesise barriers and facilitators to software acceptance. Results When presented with software recommendations, half of the participants were comfortable with accepting the recommendation. Key barriers to acceptance of software recommendations aligned with 2 Theoretical Domains Framework domains: Knowledge (uncertainty of software capability) and Beliefs about Consequences (perceived impact of software on clinical outcomes and workload). Key facilitators aligned with 2 domains: Beliefs about Consequences (improved efficiency) and Social Influences (influence of peers). A novel domain, Trust, was identified as influential. Conclusion Prescribers reported barriers to acceptance of dose-prediction software aligned with limited understanding of, and scepticism about, software capabilities, as well as concerns about clinical outcomes.

WoS,A three-dimensional macroelement for modelling the in-plane and out-of-plane response of masonry walls,"The seismic performance of unreinforced masonry buildings is commonly assessed using equivalent frame modelling. Its computational efficiency allows for a large number of analyses to be conducted, which are often required to account for epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To obtain a full description of the building response, in-plane and out-of-plane failure modes need to be considered, though previous elements for equivalent frame models of unreinforced masonry buildings only account for the in-plane response. This paper presents the formulation of a three-dimensional macroelement for modelling the dynamic in-plane and out-of-plane behaviour of masonry panels, which extends the approach of a previously developed macroelement to simulate the in-plane response. The proposed three-node, three-dimensional macroelement is implemented in the software OpenSees and describes the main features of the in-plane and out-of-plane behaviour of a masonry wall, including second-order geometrical effects and a coupled shear/flexural response.

WoS,A multi-objective radiomics model for the prediction of locoregional recurrence in head and neck squamous cell cancer,"Purpose Locoregional recurrence (LRR) is the predominant pattern of relapse after nonsurgical treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Therefore, accurately identifying patients with HNSCC who are at high risk for LRR is important for optimizing personalized treatment plans. In this work, we developed a multi-classifier, multi-objective, and multi-modality (mCOM) radiomics-based outcome prediction model for HNSCC LRR. Methods In mCOM, we considered sensitivity and specificity simultaneously as the objectives to guide the model optimization. We used multiple classifiers, comprising support vector machine (SVM), discriminant analysis (DA), and logistic regression (LR), to build the model. We used features from multiple modalities as model inputs, comprising clinical parameters and radiomics feature extracted from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images and positron emission tomography (PET) images. We proposed a multi-task multi-objective immune algorithm (mTO) to train the mCOM model and used an evidential reasoning (ER)-based method to fuse the output probabilities from different classifiers and modalities in mCOM. We evaluated the effectiveness of the developed method using a retrospective public pretreatment HNSCC dataset downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The input for our model included radiomics features extracted from pretreatment PET and CT using an open source radiomics software and clinical characteristics such as sex, age, stage, primary disease site, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, and treatment paradigm. In our experiment, 190 patients from two institutions were used for model training while the remaining 87 patients from the other two institutions were used for testing. Results When we built the predictive model using features from single modality, the multi-classifier (MC) models achieved better performance over the models built with the three base-classifiers individually. When we built the model using features from multiple modalities, the proposed method achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.76 for the radiomics-only model, and 0.77 for the model built with radiomics and clinical features, which is significantly higher than the AUCs of models built with single-modality features. The statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB software. Conclusions Comparisons with other methods demonstrated the efficiency of the mTO algorithm and the superior performance of the proposed mCOM model for predicting HNSCC LRR.",head neck cancers; multi-objective model; outcome prediction; radiomics,"Wang, K; Zhou, ZG; Wang, RF; Chen, LY; Zhang, QW; Sher, D; Wang, J",2020.0,JournalEA,MEDICAL PHYSICS,10.1002/mp.14388,"[Wang, Kai; Zhou, Zhiguo; Wang, Rongfang; Chen, Liyuan; Zhang, Qiongwen; Sher, David; Wang, Jing] UT Southwestern Med Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Zhou, Zhiguo] Univ Cent Missouri, Sch Comp Sci & Math, Warrensburg, MO 64093 USA; [Wang, Rongfang] Xidian Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Xian 710071, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiongwen] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiongwen] Sichuan Univ, Canc Ctr, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiongwen] Collaborat Innovat Ctr, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiongwen] West China Hosp, Dept Head & Neck Canc, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China",WILEY,English,0094-2405,
WoS,The 'uberization of policing'? How police negotiate and operationalise predictive policing technology,"Predictive policing generally refers to police work that utilises strategies, algorithmic technologies, and big data to generate near-future predictions about the people and places deemed likely to be involved in or experience crime. Claimed benefits of predictive policing centre on the technology's ability to enable pre-emptive police work by automating police decisions. The goal is that officers will rely on computer software and smartphone applications to instruct them about where and who to police just as Uber drivers rely on similar technologies to instruct them about where to pick up passengers. Unfortunately, little is known about the experiences of the in-field users of predictive technologies. This article helps fill this gap by addressing the under researched area of how police officers engage with predictive technologies. As such, data is presented that outlines the findings of a qualitative study with UK police organisations involved in designing and trialing predictive policing software. Research findings show that many police officers have a detailed awareness of the limitations of predictive technologies, specifically those brought about by errors and biases in input data. This awareness has led many officers to develop a sceptical attitude towards predictive technologies and, in a few cases, these officers have expressed a reluctance to use predictive technologies. Based on these findings, this paper argues that claims about predictive software's ability to neutralise the subjectivity of police work overlooks the ongoing struggles of the police officer to assert their agency and mediate the extent to which predictions will be trusted and utilised.",prediction; discretion; predictive policing; technology,"Sandhu, A; Fussey, P",2020.0,JournalEA,POLICING & SOCIETY,10.1080/10439463.2020.1803315,"[Sandhu, Ajay] Ryerson Univ, Criminol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fussey, Peter] Univ Essex, Sociol, Colchester, Essex, England","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",English,1043-9463,
WoS,Acute kidney injury after a stroke: A PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis,"Background The relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) and stroke needs quantitative summary. Therefore, we analyzed the associations between AKI and stroke including the incidence, risk factors of AKI after stroke, and the influence of AKI after a stroke on prognosis of stroke. Methods Articles published until November 2019 were searched based on the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline, and Google Scholar. We computed the following results [rates of AKI incidence after a stroke, odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) estimates and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between risk factors and AKI, ORs or RRs and the CIs for the association between AKI and outcomes after a stroke] by using STATA 13.0 software. Results The study reported an overall incidence of AKI of 12% with a random-effects model. Additionally, the present study showed that higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission and history of hypertension were associated with higher risk of AKI after stroke. Moreover, the study showed that AKI after stroke was associated with higher in-hospital mortality, higher 1-month mortality, higher long-term mortality, and poorer functional outcome. Conclusions Acute kidney injury appears to be a common complication after stroke and is related to increased mortality and disability in stroke. Additionally, high NIHSS score on admission and history of hypertension were the critical risk factors for the AKI after stroke.

WoS,Closer examination of two -trace two-dimensional (2T2D) correlation spectroscopy,"Two-trace two-dimensional (2T2D) correlation spectroscopy compares a pair of spectra by applying a form of cross correlation analysis. Planar maps of correlation intensities with two independent axes of spectral variables, like IR wavenumbers, are obtained. 2T2D correlation takes advantage of the fact that spectral intensities of bands arising from the same origin cannot change independently of each other and must be synchronized. In contrast, intensities arising from different sources often change asynchronously. Using cross peaks observed in the correlation spectra, one can distinguish and classify different contributing species represented in the original pair of spectra in a systematic manner. Highly overlapped neighboring bands originating from different sources can also be identified by the presence of asynchronous cross peaks, thus enhancing the apparent spectral resolution. It can be mathematically shown that 2T2D correlation is a special case of the well-established generalized 2D correlation scheme, where the two traces of the measured spectra are combined with an additional null spectrum with all the elements set to be zero for the analysis. This realization makes it possible to utilize existing software for generalized 2D correlation for routine 2T2D analysis. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, NO2- and NH4+ were assessed at relevant concentrations for their inhibiting or facilitating role. The inactivation enhancement during solar disinfection (SODIS) was mainly attributed to the generation of HO center dot radicals produced during by excitation of NO3-, NO2-, while the HO center dot of photo-Fenton may be transformed into other radical species in presence of ions. Natural organic matter (NOM) was found to enhance both processes but also to hinder most of the enhancing ions, except for NO2-; modeling with the APEX software unveiled the inter-relations in the presence of NOM, and the possible inactivation activity by NO2 center dot.

The framework we proposed is composed of three components, interventions design, democratization, and execution. We believe that this process will work for other FOSS communities too.

WoS,Numerical Study of a Phase Change Material Integrated Solar Thermoelectric Generator,"The numerical modelling of a phase change material (PCM) attached to a hybrid three-dimensional truncated compound parabolic concentrator and thermoelectric module is performed under transient and non-uniform variation in solar radiation. To demonstrate the higher performance of the system, the performance parameters of a stand-alone system (without PCM), SAS, and incorporated system (with PCM), IS, are modelled and studied using the ANSYS 2020 R1 software and MATLAB R2020a Simulink software. The PCM is placed at the hot junction of the solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) in order to act as a re-concentrating lens via the phase-change lensing effect and to decrease the adverse effect of transient and non-uniform solar radiation on the STEG. The results demonstrate an increase in the light transmissivity and refractive index of the PCM after melting and the efficacy of the PCM in shielding the STEG under extremely concentrated solar radiation intensities. The optimum heat input required to maximise the STEG efficiency and power output while minimising the challenge of excess heat dissipation in STEG systems is obtained and discussed. Finally, the results obtained show that the maximum temperature gradient, power output and efficiency from the stand-alone were higher than those from the incorporated system.

WoS,Failure Propensity of GFRP Strengthen RC Beam,"Fiber-reinforced polymer has eventually become a popular choice for retrofitting and strengthening of structural entities. Hence, a need arises to know the quantitative as well as qualitative effect of these techniques on the original integrity of the concerned structural entity. In the present study, the effect of change in width to depth ratio, percentage of steel and loading intensity in a simply supported reinforced concrete (RC) beam on the maximum deflection, stress, strain energy, natural frequencies and deflections of various modes of free vibration is obtained with the help of ANSYS Workbench 19.0 software till the failure of RC beam and a comparison is sought between the original beam and a failed beam retrofitted with one, two and three layers of GFRP sheets (Epoxy S-Glass UD). A standard beam of fixed dimensions and a two point loading was first simulated in the software while comparing the results with the manual calculations of maximum deflections to ascertain the most appropriate settings of the simulation in the three dimensional analysis environment of the software. Various beams were then analyzed altering the width to depth ratio, the percentage of tension steel and the loading intensity over the beam and the results of the static as well as modal (frequency) analysis were noted including the deflections, stresses, strains, strain energies, natural frequencies of first 5 modes of free vibrations and their respective displacements. The same beams were then retrofitted with layers of GFRP sheets with their principal axis inclined at an angle of 45 degrees with the span of the beam. The same analysis was done on the beams and the results were noted. These results are compared, and a multivariate regression analysis is performed over the results to obtain equations to testify the observations and the trends. This whole process gives a conclusion that the effect of retrofitting is insignificant for single layer GFRP while the most effective results were obtained for the case of triple layer GFRP. Deflections, stress and strain energy with their relative change across various cases are accurately related to the varying parameters through regression analysis.

A typical Boeing 747 rib having a circular hole with a semi-elliptical delamination was taken as the rib of interest; gust loads experienced during the cruise phase of flight were identified as the source of fatigue. A square section surrounding the circular hole comprising of laminated carbon-epoxy prepreg was isolated from the rib for computational analysis. The lack of analytical solutions for such a problem encouraged the use of the general-purpose finite element software ABAQUS. The delamination mechanism was simulated using the energy-based virtual crack closure technique in tandem with the Paris-Erdogan equation. The delamination propagation with respect to aircraft flight hours was obtained for the aircraft rib, with Mode III tearing dominating the delamination process.

WoS,"Spatio-temporal dynamics of rainfall erosivity due to climate change in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia","Rainfall erosivity is one of the main factors of soil erosion that is expected to change as climate variables alter and impact soil conservation policies significantly. It is important to understand the potential trends in rainfall erosivity and its impacts on the environment, especially in tropical areas where severe rainfall is expected to continue to rise. This study aimed to project spatial and temporal rainfall erosivity factor using ensemble Global Circulation Models (GCMs). The study employed 20 GCMs, four RCPs scenarios, and two projection timescales (2050s and 2080s). The erosivity factor was determined by integrating baseline rainfall intensity with Modified Fournier Index (MFI). The values of erosivity were then interpolated using GIS software, and thematic maps were generated for these variables. The result shows 92% coefficient of determination between observed and simulated rainfalls. The ensemble model revealed that the MAE, SE and RMSE are 0.1487, 1.3692 and 1.2499, respectively.

WoS,CFD Simulation of an Industrial PEM Fuel Cell with Local Degradation Effects,"The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell model of a commercial software package is presented. The basic performance model is extended by two chemical degradation effects: ionomer degradation and carbon corrosion including platinum oxidation. The ionomer degradation model describes the ionomer mass loss due to hydrogen peroxide formation and subsequent attack of the ionomer by radicals. The carbon corrosion model calculates the carbon mass loss caused by carbon oxidation and the active area reduction due to platinum oxidation. The degradation models are coupled with an agglomerate model of the catalyst layer. The model is validated against measurements on an industrial cell. For these measurements, the cell is equipped with a segmented measuring board, which is used to measure the current density distribution and high frequency resistance of every segment. In order to test the predictability of the model under different operating conditions, measurements for stoichiometry and pressure variations are carried out. Calculated and measured current density distributions of the cell, aged by an accelerated stress test, are compared for the validation of the degradation model. Moreover, 3D simulation results of the fresh and aged cells are analyzed in detail and the influence of operating conditions on fuel cell aging is pointed out.",AVL FIRE; CFD Simulation; Degradation Modeling; Electrochemistry; Fuel Cells,"Fink, C; Gossling, S; Karpenko-Jereb, L; Urthaler, P",2020.0,JournalEA,FUEL CELLS,10.1002/fuce.201900197,"[Fink, C.; Urthaler, P.] AVL List GmbH, Hans List Pl 1, A-8020 Graz, Austria; [Goessling, S.] ZBT, Carl Benz Str 201, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany; [Karpenko-Jereb, L.] Graz Univ Technol, Inffeldgasse 10-2, A-8010 Graz, Austria",WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,English,1615-6846,
WoS,In silico identification of widely used and well-tolerated drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors for direct use in clinical trials,"Despite strict measures taken by many countries, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be an issue of global concern. Currently, there are no clinically proven pharmacotherapies for coronavirus disease 2019, despite promising initial results obtained from drugs such as azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, the repurposing of clinically approved drugs for use against SARS-CoV-2 has become a viable strategy. Here, we searched for drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by in silico screening of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug library. Well-tolerated and widely used drugs were selected for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate drug-protein interactions and their persistence under physiological conditions. Tetracycline, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, dutasteride, nelfinavir, and paliperidone formed stable interactions with 3CL(pro)based on MD simulation results. Similar analysis with RdRp showed that eltrombopag, tipranavir, ergotamine, and conivaptan bound to the enzyme with high binding free energies. Docking results suggest that ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, bromocriptine, dutasteride, conivaptan, paliperidone, and tipranavir can bind to both enzymes with high affinity. As these drugs are well tolerated, cost-effective, and widely used, our study suggests that they could potentially to be used in clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

Furthermore, the algorithm of the plane wave simulation is developed and implemented in software, which allows us to demonstrate the general properties of electromagnetic field in the media described by FO models (FOMs). The differences in interpretation of the fundamental theorems of electromagnetics (i.e. Poynting's theorem, the uniqueness theorem and the Lorentz reciprocity theorem) in comparison to integer-order electromagnetics are analysed.

Materials and Methods Smartphone video and laser scanning data were recorded for five healthy volunteers (24.1 +/- 0.7 years). Three-dimensional (3D) facial models were generated using photogrammetry software and a laser scanner. Smartphone-recorded video data were used to generate a photogrammetric 3D model. The videos were recorded at two resolutions: 1080 x 1920 (high resolution) and 720 x 1280 pixels (low resolution). The lengths of five nasal component parts (nose height, nasal dorsum length, nasal column length, nasal ala length, and nose breadth) were compared in the photogrammetric 3D models (as the test model) and the laser scanned 3D models (as the validation model) using reverse engineering software. Results There was a significant difference in the nasal dorsum length between the test model and the validation model (high resolution; 95% confidence interval, 2.05-5.07, Low resolution; confidence interval, 2.19-5.69). In contrast to the nasal dorsum length, there were no significant differences in nose height, nose breadth, nasal ala length, and nasal column length.

An independently developed electromagnetic induction type conductivity sensor, a quick response thermistor and a high-precision pressure sensor is used to integrate the CTD sensor. Several designs of compact mechanical structure and low-power control acquisition circuit are developed in the CTD sensor. The SZQ1-1 CTD is calibrated with measuring instrument in the laboratory and fourth-degree polynomial fitting equations are developed to fit the curves. After software-based calibration, the SZQ1-1 is compared with SBE 19plus by sea trial. The SZQ1-1 and SBE 19plus were carried by an underwater glider which dived in Northern South China Sea with a maximum depth of 500.36 m. Because the thermal lag error exists in the original data measured with the CTD sensor in the underwater glider, the measured conductivity and salinity data are revised again in the software.

WoS,Wait for it: identifying On-Hold self-admitted technical debt,"Self-admitted technical debt refers to situations where a software developer knows that their current implementation is not optimal and indicates this using a source code comment. In this work, we hypothesize that it is possible to develop automated techniques to understand a subset of these comments in more detail, and to propose tool support that can help developers manage self-admitted technical debt more effectively. Based on a qualitative study of 333 comments indicating self-admitted technical debt, we first identify one particular class of debt amenable to automated management: on-hold self-admitted technical debt (on-hold SATD), i.e., debt which contains a condition to indicate that a developer is waiting for a certain event or an updated functionality having been implemented elsewhere. We then design and evaluate an automated classifier which can identify these on-hold instances with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98 as well as detect the specific conditions that developers are waiting for. Our work presents a first step towards automated tool support that is able to indicate when certain instances of self-admitted technical debt are ready to be addressed.",Self-admitted technical debt; Qualitative study; Classification,"Maipradit, R; Treude, C; Hata, H; Matsumoto, K",2020.0,JournalEA,EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,10.1007/s10664-020-09854-3,"[Maipradit, Rungroj; Hata, Hideaki; Matsumoto, Kenichi] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Ikoma, Japan; [Treude, Christoph] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia",SPRINGER,English,1382-3256,
WoS,Preliminary application of 3D-printed individualised guiding templates for total hip arthroplasty in Crowe type IV developmental dysplasia of the hip,"Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of three-dimensional (3D)-printed individualised guiding templates in total hip arthroplasty (THA) for the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Methods: 12 hips in 12 patients with Crowe type IV DDH were treated with THA. A 3D digital model of the pelvis and lower limbs was reconstructed using the computed tomography data of the patients. Preoperative surgical simulations were performed to determine the most suitable surgical planning, including femoral osteotomy and prosthesis placement. Based on the ideal surgical planning, individualised guiding templates were designed by software, manufactured using a 3D printer, and used in acetabulum reconstruction and femoral osteotomy during surgery. Results: 12 patients were followed up for an average of 72.42 months (range 38-135 months). During surgery, the guiding template for each case was matched to the bony markers of the acetabulum and proximal femur. Preoperative and follow-up Harris hip scores were 34.2 +/- 3.7 and 85.2 +/- 4.2; leg length discrepancy, 51.5 +/- 6.5 mm and 10.2 +/- 1.5 mm; and visual analogue scale scores, 6.2 +/- 0.8 and 1.3 +/- 0.3, respectively, with statistical difference. Shortened deformity and claudication of the affected limb were obviously improved after surgery. However, 1 patient had artificial hip dislocation 2 weeks after surgery, and another patient had sciatic nerve traction injury, both of whom recovered after physical treatment. Conclusions: Preoperative surgical simulation and 3D-printed individualised guiding templates can fulfil surgeon-specific requirements for the treatment of Crowe type IV DDH. Accurate THA can be achieved using 3D-printed individualised templates, which provide a new personalised surgical plan for the precise positioning and orientation of acetabular reconstruction and femoral osteotomy.",Developmental dysplasia of the hip; guiding template; 3D printing; total hip arthroplasty,"Tu, Q; Ding, HW; Chen, H; Shen, JJ; Miao, QJ; Liu, B; Yu, GW; Huang, XH; Zhu, CR; Tang, Y; Xia, H; Xu, JZ",2020.0,JournalEA,HIP INTERNATIONAL,10.1177/1120700020948006,"[Tu, Qiang; Tang, Yong; Xu, Jian-zhong] Third Mil Med Univ, Southwest Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Chongqing 400038, Peoples R China; [Tu, Qiang; Chen, Hu; Huang, Xian-hua; Zhu, Chang-rong; Xia, Hong] Gen Hosp Southern Theatre Command PLA, Dept Orthopaed, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tu, Qiang; Chen, Hu] Southern Med Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Sch Clin Med 1, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Ding, Huan-wen; Miao, Qiu-ju] South China Univ Technol, Sch Med, Dept Anat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Ding, Huan-wen] Guangzhou First Peoples Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Shen, Jian-jian] Guangdong Integrat Med Hosp, Dept Spinal Surg, Foshan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bao] Zhongshan Torch Dev Zone Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Zhongshan, Peoples R China; [Yu, Guang-wen] Guangzhou Orthopaed Hosp, Dept Sports Med, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,English,1120-7000,
WoS,Symmetrical Fault Detection During Power Swing Using Mean Value of Sampled Data from the Current Signal,"One of the most challenging events for distance relays is a transient phenomenon known as power swing, which can have damaging results to the system. The occurrence of power swing can cause the impedance trajectory to enter protective zones of distance relays that may lead them to the wrong operation. Malfunction of distance relays can create instability in power systems, and a large blackout may occur in these networks. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method based on using the mean value of sampled data from the current signal to recognize power swing from simultaneous faults. This method has been tested using DIgSILENT and MATLAB software on a two-bus network with parallel lines. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of detecting various types of power swings, including both unstable and stable power swing. The presented method in this paper also has an accurate operation to detect simultaneous symmetric faults.

WoS,Hilbert-Huangtransform based fault identification and classification technique forACpower transmission line protection,"In the modern power system, the fault identification and classification is one of the challenging tasks during high fault impedance due to low change in the magnitude of fault current from steady-state to fault inception. In this paper, a high impedance fault detection technique is proposed based on Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). The energy for each phase is computed from the intrinsic mode function (IMF) of three-phase voltage/current signals. An average relay energy index (AREI) is proposed to detect the transmission line fault in the large interconnected power system. Furthermore, a fault classification technique is also proposed based on relay energy index (REI) of each phase of the three-phase voltage/current signals. The proposed HHT based fault detection technique is validated on standard WSCC 9 bus and IEEE 14 bus test power systems using PSCAD and MATLAB software.

WoS,Hinge fracture in lateral closed-wedge distal femoral osteotomy in knees undergoing double-level osteotomy: assessment of postoperative change in rotational alignment using CT evaluation,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the radiological features of hinge fracture occurring at the distal medial femoral cortex in knees undergoing biplanar lateral closed-wedge distal femoral osteotomy (LCW-DFO) in double-level osteotomy (DLO) based on pre- and postoperative CT image analyses. It was hypothesised that medial hinge fractures in LCW-DFO would occur with a similar incidence to that in high tibial osteotomy, and its occurrence would affect the clinical/radiological outcomes and induce unintended change in alignment depending on the fracture type (direction of the fracture). Methods A consecutive series of 36 knees (31 patients) with primary varus osteoarthritis undergoing DLO comprised the study population. The mean age at surgery was 62.0 +/- 5.9 years. Presence of hinge fracture was assessed on radiographs and CT images at 1 week. The fracture type was classified depending on the direction of the fracture line: crack propagation in line with the osteotomy (type 1) and fractures extending proximally (type 2) or distally (type 3) from the tip of the wedge. Computer-assisted assessments of bony limb alignment and bony geometry were conducted on a full-length weight-bearing radiograph and CT images using image analysis software. In addition, subjective clinical results were evaluated using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Radiological and clinical follow-up results at 1 and 2 years were compared to the preoperative data, while comparative analysis was made between the subjects with and without a hinge fracture. Results Postoperative image examinations revealed type 1 and 2 medial femoral hinge fractures in 4 and 7 knees, while no type 3 fracture was identified in the study population. Consequently, the overall incidence of the hinge fracture was 30.6% (11 of the 36 knees). Four of those 11 fractures (36.4%) could not be detected on plain radiographs. CT image analysis for three-dimensional bony geometry showed greater increase in internal rotation of the distal bony segment (increased femoral antetorsion by 9.5 degrees on average) after surgery compared to the knees without a hinge fracture (P = 0.01). Clinical evaluation using the KOOS at 2 years showed no significant difference between the groups with and without hinge fractures. Conclusion In LCW-DFO, medial femoral hinge fractures occurred in 30.6% of the cases. Knees with type 1 hinge fracture exhibited significantly greater increase in femoral antetorsion as compared to those without hinge fracture. In this case series, postoperative weight-bearing protocol was delayed for knees with hinge fracture.

WoS,MARVEL: Enabling controller load balancing in software-defined networks with multi-agent reinforcement learning,"The control plane plays a significant role in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). A large SDN usually implements its control plane with several distributed controllers, each controlling a subset of switches and synchronizing with other controllers to maintain a consistent network view. Under the fluctuating network traffic, a static controller-switch mapping relationship could lead to imbalanced workload allocation. Controllers may getoverloaded and reject new requests, eventually reducing the control plane's request processing ability. Most existing schemes have relied heavily on iterative optimization algorithms to manipulate the mapping relationship between controllers and switches, which are either time-consuming or less satisfactory in terms of performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic controller workload balancing scheme, that is termed MARVEL, based on multi-agent reinforcement learning for generation of switch migration actions. MARVEL works in two phases: offline training and online decision making. In the training phase, each agent learns how to migrate switches through interacting with the network. In the online phase, MARVEL is deployed to make decisions on migrating switches. Experimental results show that MARVEL outperforms competing existing schemes by improving the control plane's request processing ability at least 27.3% while using 25% less processing time.",Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Neural networks; Software-defined networking; Switch migration,"Sun, PH; Guo, ZH; Wang, G; Lan, JL; Hu, YX",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTER NETWORKS,10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107230,"[Sun, Penghao; Lan, Julong; Hu, Yuxiang] Natl Digital Switching Syst Engn & Technol Res Ct, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Guo, Zehua; Wang, Gang] Beijing Inst Technol, 5 Zhongguancun ST South, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, 117 Pleasant ST, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",ELSEVIER,English,1389-1286,
WoS,The efficient inclusion of rotation-induced inertia effects in a shaft-blisk assembly model using zero-speed modes,"A successful design of rotating shaft-bladed disk (blisk) assemblies requires the facility to reliably predict the resonance speeds, which must be avoided during operation to avoid failure. Rotation-induced inertia effects (centrifugal stiffening, spin softening, Coriolis forces and gyroscopic moments) can cause significant variation of the modal frequencies with speed. A review of the state-of-the-art highlights the need for a methodology that can efficiently include all rotation-induced inertia effects in a generic shaft-blisk system. The novel contribution of this paper is a methodology to include such effects in a generic shaft-blisk system, using zero-speed finite element (FE) modal data, without the need for additional FE analysis at each speed, or the derivation of equations from first principles. This contribution is motivated by the need to upgrade an existing blisk simulator designed to generate blade tip timing (BTT) data for the development and validation of BTT algorithms. Rotational effects are added as discretised external excitations to the modal equations, which remain based on the zero-speed modes. The method is progressively validated on six examples, using results from the literature and commercial FE rotordynamics software, to demonstrate its accuracy and high efficiency of computation for both Campbell diagrams and forced response.

WoS,A three-dimensional modal theory-based Timoshenko finite length beam model for train-track dynamic analysis,"An efficient Timoshenko beam model of finite length is developed for train-track interaction dynamics. The rail is reduced to the present beam model and its vertical and lateral bending, shear, and torsion deformations are considered. A moving control volume attached to the train is introduced, which encloses the reduced rail, and a reference coordinate system is established in the reduced rail at the left end. The arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method and the modal superposition method (MSM) are adopted, and governing equations of the reduced rail model are derived by Lagrange's equations. Owing to the advantages of the MSM, the number of degrees of freedom of the current formulation is clearly reduced and its efficiency is greatly improved. A long non-ballasted track of finite length subjected to a constant moving load is first considered, and results from the present beam model are in good agreement with those from the traditional finite element method. A three-dimensional train-track interaction problem with consideration of a ballasted track is further studied. Results from the present beam model are compared with those from the commercial software Simpack where the MSM is used, and they are in good agreement with each other. Since the number of modes in the present beam model is much fewer than that in Simpack, the present beam model is more efficient than that in Simpack. It is found that the number of shape functions and the length of the beam model used in calculation can significantly affect the accuracy and efficiency of the present beam model, which should be taken into consideration. The current beam formulation is independent of the moving velocity of the train and can handle train-track dynamics with variable train velocities. The current beam formulation is straightforward and can be easily extended in various complex applications. It is more suitable for dealing with long-term train-track interaction dynamics.

WoS,Mitigation of transient overvoltages in microgrid including PV arrays,"This study investigates the mitigation of transient overvoltages (TOVs) in a microgrid supplied by renewable distributed generation resources, which include photovoltaic (PV) generators, hydro generation unit, and wind power generators. ATP/EMTP is used in this study as electromagnetic transient software. Accurate simulation models are needed to carry out the study. Therefore, a three-phase PV system model based on the equivalent Newton-Raphson circuit is used, and the efficiency of the PV system components is studied. Then, the use of the PV generation system model for switching studies is investigated using two different electrical systems. The use of different mitigation methods for TOVs at the microgrid is investigated. Three different mitigation methods are considered. First, a device to compensate reactive power such as static var compensator (SVC) is represented as a TOVs mitigation method. Then, adding a supercapacitor as TOVs mitigation method is evaluated. After that, a combination of active and reactive power simultaneously to mitigate TOV, by the addition of SVC to a supercapacitor, is investigated. The grid-connected mode and isolated mode of the microgrid are considered. The results show that the usage of SVC with supercapacitor has the ability to mitigate the transient overvoltage and the waveforms are more regular.",power generation control; photovoltaic power systems; overvoltage; overvoltage protection; distributed power generation; supercapacitors; EMTP; power grids; static VAr compensators; TOV; different mitigation methods; reactive power; SVC; TOVs mitigation method; supercapacitor; transient overvoltage; microgrid including PV arrays; renewable distributed generation resources; photovoltaic generators; hydro generation unit; wind power generators; electromagnetic transient software; accurate simulation models; three-phase PV system model; equivalent Newton-Raphson circuit; PV system components; PV generation system model; different electrical systems,"Awad, EA; Badran, EA",2020.0,Journal,IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION,10.1049/iet-gtd.2019.1035,"[Awad, Eman Ahmed; Badran, Ebrahim A.] Mansoura Univ, Fac Engn, Elect Engn Dept, Mansoura, Egypt",INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET,English,1751-8687,

WoS,Total Hip Arthroplasty Digital Templating: Size Predicting Ability and Interobserver Variability,"Background During the last century, total hip arthroplasties have become more popular. They have had a huge impact on the quality of life, pain, range of motion, social interaction, and psychological well-being. A number of studies have emphasized the importance of using templates to choose the appropriate implant size when planning the surgery. Our aim is to use MediCad(R)software to analyze the ability of the digital template system MediCad(R)to predict the size of the implant needed in total hip arthroplasties. Materials and Methods An arthroplasty preoperative plan was created according to the MediCad(R)software guidelines, on anteroposterior hip X-ray by one junior resident, one senior resident, and three experienced hip surgeons. Results The median size accuracy was 0.7 (range: 0.27-0.87) for the cup, 0.73 (range: 0.36-0.83) for the stem, and 0.28 (range: -0.14-0.69) for the neck. Interobserver reliability was good (kappa > 0.4) and stronger when measuring the stem than when doing so with the cup.

WoS,Simulation and prediction of surface water quality using stochastic models,"In recent years, surface water quality has decreased due to the increasing demand for water and increasing the use of fertilizers, pesticides and the discharge of domestic and municipal wastewater to surface water. The purpose of this research is a comparison of the efficiency of different time-series models in modeling and prediction of monthly water quality performance in Harmaleh area of Khuzestan in the southwest of Iran. Water quality parameters including Ca, HCO3, SO4, Ec, pH, Mg, Cl, Na, and TDS for the period of 2001 to 2014 were evaluated. Five time-series models (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA) with 12 different structures were assessed by R software. First, the data were normalized using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Also, the adequacy of data was tested by Hurst's coefficient. The Hurst coefficient was > 0.5 for all investigated parameters, which indicated suitable length of the time series for the modeling. As the components of trend, jump, and seasonality are usually specific, modeling of them is not required, but modeling of stochastic components is of importance in water resources simulation and management. Therefore, using the R software, deterministic parts of the time series (e.g., trend, jump, and seasonality) were eliminated and non-deterministic component (e.g., randomness) was simulated (from 2011 to 2014), and finally, the data were predicted (from 2015 to 2018) based on the optimized models. The optimized models were selected based on auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF) as well as the use of Akaike information criteria (AIC) and coefficient of determination. Results showed that in 66% of data ARMA [with the same rate of ARMA (1, 2), ARMA (2, 1), and ARMA (2, 2)], in 22% of data AR (1), and in 11% of data ARIMA (1, 1, 2) models presented the highest efficiency in monthly water quality simulation. Finally, each quality parameter was also predicted for the next 4 years (2015-2018) based on the selected optimized models. Results indicated that the values of SO(4)and pH, respectively, showed the highest and lowest correlation with the related observations with a coefficient of determination of 0.54 and 0.19.

WoS,Estimation of genetic parameters for growth traits and Kleiber ratios in Boer x Central Highland goat,"Accurate performance evaluation and genetic parameters estimation are the prerequisites for any successful genetic improvement program. This study was conducted to estimate genetic parameters for growth and Kleiber ratio traits in Boer x Central Highland goats. On-station data collected from 2009 to 2018 were utilized for the study. A general linear model procedure of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS, version 9.0) was used to analyze fixed effects, and genetic parameters were estimated using the WOMBAT software fitted animal model. The log-likelihood ratio test was used for selecting the best fitted model. Based on best fitted models, the total heritability (h(t)(2)) estimate for birth weight (BWT), weaning weight (WWT), six-month weight (SMWT), nine-month weight (NMWT), and yearling weight (YWT) were 0.38, 0.12, 0.05, 0.30, and 0.28, respectively. The total heritability (h(t)(2)) estimates for weight gain from birth to weaning (ADG1), 3 to 6 months (ADG2), 6 to 9 months (ADG3), and 9 to 12 months of age (ADG4) were 0.09, 0.08, 0.16, and 0.14, respectively. The heritability estimates for Kleiber ratios in different growth phases were found to be low (0.09 to 0.18) based on the selected models. Even with this figure, including the Kleiber ratio in the selection criteria would be imperative to improve the feed efficiency of crossbred goats. The direct genetic correlation estimates among growth traits range from 0.60 +/- 0.14 to 0.97 +/- 0.12. Except for NMWT, ADG4, and Kleiber ratio from 9 months to yearling age, the maternal effect had a significant influence on all considered traits. However, the contribution of the maternal genetic effect was more important for early growth traits. Thus, considering both the direct additive genetic effect and the maternal genetic effect is imperative for accurate genetic evaluation and for high selection response. The moderate heritability estimates for most of the growth traits implies the possibility of selection in conjunction with crossbreeding for a better genetic response. The positive and high genetic correlation estimates among growth traits confirm the possibility of a selection of goats at an early age.",Feed efficiency; Genetic trend; Heritability; Inbreeding; Maternal effect,"Tesema, Z; Alemayehu, K; Getachew, T; Kebede, D; Deribe, B; Taye, M; Tilahun, M; Lakew, M; Kefale, A; Belayneh, N; Zegeye, A; Yizengaw, L",2020.0,JournalEA,TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION,10.1007/s11250-020-02345-z,"[Tesema, Zeleke; Deribe, Belay; Kefale, Alemu; Belayneh, Negus; Zegeye, Asres; Yizengaw, Liuel] Sirinka Agr Res Ctr, POB 74, Woldia, Ethiopia; [Tesema, Zeleke; Alemayehu, Kefyalew; Kebede, Damitie; Taye, Mengistie] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, POB 5501, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Getachew, Tesfaye] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas ICARDA, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Tilahun, Mekonnen] Andasa Livestock Res Ctr, POB 27, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Lakew, Mesfin] Amhara Agr Res Inst, POB 527, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia",SPRINGER,English,0049-4747,
WoS,Reasons associated with preservice teachers' intention to use immersive virtual reality in education,"The recent interest in the use of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in education seems to correspond with the increased affordability, accessibility and functionality of IVR hardware and software. IVR has the potential to enhance immersion, improve spatial capabilities, promote empathy, increase motivation and possibly improve learning outcomes. However, the extent to which teachers capitalise on these potentials in the future depends their perceptions of IVR and their behavioural intentions to use it. Accordingly, this study aimed to identify relevant factors and influences relating to preservice teachers' behavioural intention to use IVR, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that UTAUT2 provided a suitable model to describe preservice teachers' perceptions of IVR on all dimensions (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, habit and behavioural intention), with hedonic motivation receiving the highest scores and habit scoring the lowest. Interview responses revealed the reasons for the substantial variation in preservice teacher perceptions, which depended on a range of external- (first-order), internal- (second-order) and design (third-order)-related issues.

WoS,A Modified Transient Current Limiter to Mitigate Energization Inrush Current in Wind Turbine Transformers,"Energization of wind turbine transformers (WTTs) in wind power plants (WPPs) leads to high transient inrush current, which imposes high mechanical and thermal stresses on transformer windings and voltage sag problems at grid connection point (GCP). Therefore, to solve these problems, the inrush current should be suppressed during the energization time. The current research presents a modified transient current limiter (MTCL) for suppressing WTTs' inrush current. Two types of MTCL such as resistor type (R-type) and reactor type (L-type) are considered for this purpose. To investigate the efficiency of the MTCL, a WPP includes five wind turbines which are simulated by PSCAD/EMTDC software. The simulation results reveal that the MTCL is an effective means for suppressing the WTTs' inrush current and mitigating GCP voltage sag during energization. Besides, to show the effectiveness of the proposed MTCL, the performance of the MTCL is compared with the conventional TCL through simulation.",Wind power plants (WPPs); Wind turbine transformers (WTTs); Modified transient current limiter (MTCL); Inrush current; Voltage sag,"Ganji, M; Bigdeli, M; Azizian, D",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS,10.1007/s40313-020-00630-8,"[Ganji, Morteza; Bigdeli, Mehdi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Zanjan Branch, Zanjan, Iran; [Azizian, Davood] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Abhar Branch, Abhar, Iran",SPRINGER,English,2195-3880,
WoS,The Effect of Registration on Voxel-Wise Tofts Model Parameters and Uncertainties from DCE-MRI of Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients Using 3DSlicer,"We quantitatively investigate the influence of image registration, using open-source software (3DSlicer), on kinetic analysis (Tofts model) of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI of early-stage breast cancer patients. We also show that registration computation time can be reduced by reducing the percent sampling (PS) of voxels used for estimation of the cost function. DCE-MRI breast images were acquired on a 3T-PET/MRI system in 13 patients with early-stage breast cancer who were scanned in a prone radiotherapy position. Images were registered using a BSpline transformation with a 2 cm isotropic grid at 100, 20, 5, 1, and 0.5PS (BRAINSFit in 3DSlicer). Signal enhancement curves were analyzed voxel-by-voxel using the Tofts kinetic model. Comparing unregistered with registered groups, we found a significant change in the 90th percentile of the voxel-wise distribution of K-trans. We also found a significant reduction in the following: (1) in the standard error (uncertainty) of the parameter value estimation, (2) the number of voxel fits providing unphysical values for the extracellular-extravascular volume fraction (v(e) > 1), and (3) goodness of fit. We found no significant differences in the median of parameter value distributions (K-trans,v(e)) between unregistered and registered images. Differences between parameters and uncertainties obtained using 100PS versus 20PS were small and statistically insignificant. As such, computation time can be reduced by a factor of 2, on average, by using 20PS while not affecting the kinetic fit.

WoS,Software process selection system based on multicriteria decision making,"Whatever be the nature of underlying software, the impact of the software development process that was used to create it would remain vital. The objective of this paper is to provide a process selection framework for the software development firm's engineers and managers, looking to identify the proper way to build software to run on a mobile, web, or desktop. The motivation behind this work comes from the fact that the applications that fall in one of the above three categories can be significantly different in terms of scale, UI, and memory requirements, time to market, and other characteristics. Software development that needs to be completed in a challenging timeframe has to resort to principles and values as declared in Agile Manifesto. The availability of various agile methodologies has made the project managers often stuck when selecting the most suitable one. The proposed agile process identification system addresses this dilemma of engineering fraternity using a fuzzy variant of a popular multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique called the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The proposed system is validated through a primary dataset generated as a result of the development of 20 software projects.

WoS,Genetic variant rs72613567 ofHSD17B13gene reduces alcohol-related liver disease risk in Chinese Han population,"Background & Aims Recently, the variant rs72613567:TA in the 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) has been associated with reduced levels of ALT and AST and a reduced risk of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) in the European population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between the polymorphisms ofHSD17B13and ALD, liver serum markers and patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) p.I148M in the Chinese Han population. Methods A case-control study was performed from five centres and included 769 ALD patients and 767 healthy controls. Two SNPs (rs72613567 and rs6834314) inHSD17B13were genotyped using the Sequenom MassArray system and allele association analysis was performed using PLINK 1.90 software. Results HSD17B13rs72613567:TA allele was associated with a reduced risk of ALD by 19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05-0.31,P = .01), uniformly, the G allele in the rs6834314 reduced the risk of ALD by 19% (95% CI: 0.05-0.31,P = 8.28 x 10(-3)). And the genotypes of two SNPs were associated with reducing the risk of ALD in three genetic model analysis. In addition, we found that TA allele was associated with lower levels of serum ALT, AST and GGT (P = .005, .007 and .02, respectively), higher level of serum ALB (P = .02), but not associated with ALP. In this cohort, the interaction betweenHSD17B13rs72613567 and the steatogenic allelePNPLA3rs738409 was not validated.

WoS,Effects of cost surface uncertainty on current density estimates from circuit theory,"Background: Conservation practitioners are often interested in developing land use plans that increase landscape connectivity, which is defined as the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches. Landscape connectivity is often estimated with a cost surface that indicates the varying costs experienced by an organism in moving across a landscape. True, or absolute costs are rarely known however, and therefore assigning costs to different landscape elements is often a challenge in creating cost surface maps. As such, we consider it important to understand the sensitivity of connectivity estimates to uncertainty in cost estimates. Methods: We used simulated landscapes to test the sensitivity of current density estimates from circuit theory to varying relative cost values, fragmentation, and number of cost classes (i.e., thematic resolution). Current density is proportional to the probability of use during a random walk. Using Circuitscape software, we simulated electrical current between pairs of nodes to create current density maps. We then measured the correlation of the current density values across scenarios. Results: In general, we found that cost values were highly correlated across scenarios with different cost weights (mean correlation ranged from 0.87 to 0.92). Changing the spatial configuration of landscape elements by varying the degree of fragmentation reduced correlation in current density across maps. We also found that correlations were more variable when the range of cost values in a map was high. Discussion: The low sensitivity of current density estimates to relative cost weights suggests that the measure may be reliable for land use applications even when there is uncertainty about absolute cost values, provided that the user has the costs correctly ranked. This finding should facilitate the use of cost surfaces by conservation practitioners interested in estimating connectivity and planning linkages and corridors.",Cost surface; Circuitscape; Circuit theory; Landscape connectivity; Current density; Least cost path; Dispersal,"Bowman, J; Adey, E; Angoh, SYJ; Baici, JE; Brown, MGC; Cordes, C; Dupuis, AE; Newar, SL; Scott, LM; Solmundson, K",2020.0,Journal,PEERJ,10.7717/peerj.9617,"[Bowman, Jeff; Cordes, Chad] Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Bowman, Jeff; Adey, Elizabeth; Angoh, Siow Y.

WoS,ArborTracking: a tree topology track pattern recognition algorithm,"Purpose The purpose of this work is to develop a novel pattern tracking algorithm to be used on the detectors of the future electron-positron colliders. Method ArborTracking, a light-weighted tracking algorithm, has been developed based on the tree topology of track clusters and applied to the baseline detector of the circular electron-positron collider (CEPC). The algorithm collects all the hits in the tracker as a tree (forest), splits the tree branches to form the track segments, and merges the track segments to form the tracks. Results Compared with the general track following method, the algorithm has the advantages of low coding complicity and low CPU cost. The performances at different benchmarks are studied. The results are exhaustively listed showing that the method is approaching the limit of the detector. The tracking efficiencies on single muon sample and three-prong sample are both higher than 99%. The transverse momentum resolution reaches 0.1% level and the boson mass resolution reaches 4.7 GeV/c. Conclusions The performances are similar with those of the baseline tracking algorithm of CEPC, and the physics requirement of CEPC is satisfied. The new tree pattern recognition algorithm is a necessary part in the CEPC software.

WoS,Estimating the intermediate precision in petroleum analysis by (+/-)electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry,"Rationale Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) is an important analytical technique used for the elucidation of crude oil polar compounds at the molecular level, providing thousands of heteroatom compounds in a single analysis. Due to the high resolution, the complexity of data produced, and steps involved in spectra acquisition and processing, it is necessary to estimate its intermediate precision. Methods Intermediate precision was estimated for positive- and negative-ion ionization modes (ESI(+/-)) using Composer (R) software for two Brazilian crude oil samples. The analytical parameters evaluated were the class distribution histogram, the double bond equivalent (DBE) distribution, and the DBE versus carbon number. The statistical parameters used to study the intermediate precision were calculated from the average, standard deviation, confidence interval (significance level at 5%), coefficient of variation (CV), intermediate precision limit (ISO 5725), and principal component analysis (PCA). Results Two crude oil samples (A and B) were analyzed, in triplicate, for seven consecutive days by ESI(+/-) FT-ICR MS. The assigned class limit by ESI(+) for crude oil A was 0.42% (O2S[H] class) and for crude oil B was 0.04% (N2O2S[H] class). The assigned DBE intensity limits for the two crude oils were 0.04% for ESI(+) and 0.013% for ESI(-). The PCA for ESI(-) and ESI(+) modes presented better precision for crude oils B and A, respectively. Conclusions The most abundant classes and DBE of the majority class (i.e., with the highest intensity) are the parameters produced from the Composer (R) software that had the highest precision and can be used to estimate crude oil properties. The DBE values presented lower intermediate precision limit values (0.04%) than the assigned class values (0.4%). According to CV and PCA, ESI(+) was more precise for crude oil A (83% precision) and ESI(-) for crude oil B (84% precision).",,"Folli, GS; Souza, LM; Araujo, BQ; Romao, W; Filgueiras, PR",2020.0,JournalEA,RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY,10.1002/rcm.8861,"[Folli, Gabriely S.; Souza, Lindamara M.; Araujo, Bruno Q.; Romao, Wanderson; Filgueiras, Paulo R.] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Ctr Competence Petr Chem NCQP, Lab Res & Dev Methodol Anal Oils LabPetro, Dept Chem, Ave Fernando Ferrari 514, BR-29075910 Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Folli, Gabriely S.; Souza, Lindamara M.; Romao, Wanderson] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Chem, Petrole & Forens Chem Lab, Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Romao, Wanderson] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Espirito Santo, Vila Velha, Brazil",WILEY,English,0951-4198,

WoS,Strong and weak form solutions of curved beams via Carrera's unified formulation,"In this article, the mechanical behavior of three-dimensional curved beams is investigated through closed-form solution as well as one-dimensional finite elements based on Carrera's Unified Formulation (CUF). CUF is a hierarchical formulation in which the approximation order of the displacement field is a free parameter of the analysis. Therefore, refined models accounting for higher-order effects such as shear deformation and local warping can be obtained with no need for ad hoc formulations. The principle of virtual displacements (PVD) is used in order to derive both strong and weak formulations. For the latter, locking phenomena typical of curved finite elements are tackled by means of a Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components (MITC). Numerical results for different boundary conditions and loading configurations are investigated and validated towards elasticity solutions and commercial software finite elements showing that the proposed formulation can lead to an accurate evaluation of the displacement and stress fields with reduced computational costs.",Curved beams; Carrera Unified Formulation; closed form solutions; one-dimensional finite elements; mixed interpolation of tensorial components,"De Pietro, G; de Miguel, AG; Carrera, E; Giunta, G; Belouettar, S; Pagani, A",2020.0,Journal,MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES,10.1080/15376494.2018.1510066,"[De Pietro, Gabriele; Giunta, Gaetano; Belouettar, Salim] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [De Pietro, Gabriele; de Miguel, Alberto Garcia; Carrera, E.] Politecn Torino, Turin, Italy; [Pagani, Alfonso] So Duca Abruzzi 24, Turin, Italy",TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,English,1537-6494,
WoS,"Enterprise resource planning and business model innovation: process, evolution and outcome","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to focus on the implementation process of enterprise resource planning (ERP), the evolution of business model innovation (BMI) and the organizational outcome. This research analyses how ERP and BMI are related and, in turn, what is the final the impact on organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach The sample consisted on 104 organizations from different industries, all of which used an ERP software. A structural equation model was used to test the six hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that the BMI constructs considered (i.e. value-generation and organizational complexity) mediate the impact of the ERP constructs (organizational adaptation and organizational resistance), in organizational performance. Successful ERP implementation is not an end itself for this companies, but merely a path and a process for improving the business model with the aim improving performance in the marketplace. Research limitations/implications This study offers a new outlook on how a company should leverage the ERP adaptation, and any resistance in the organization to innovating in the business model. This study is rooted in the evolutionary perspective of BMI, but it also integrates into an overall model other points of view such as the rational positioning view and cognitive view. Practical implications Organizations must understand the ERP flows in depth, each ERP flow is the work result of a multitude of companies over several years. All departments, and in particular the research and development department must participate actively in the ERP implementation. Organised complexity means opportunities for success in the market. Organizations must train their departments in ERP and not just teach them how the ERP works. ERP implementation needs consider improvements to the business model and ultimately the performance, but not separately. Originality/value BMI has received contributions from several domains such as entrepreneurship, management organization and strategic management among others. Nonetheless, the role of ERP in BMI is far from being understood and the few contributions focus only on technologyper se.

WoS,Genome-wide association analysis of aluminum tolerance related traits in rapeseed (Brassica napusL.) during germination,"With the increasing acidification of soil, aluminum (Al) toxicity has become one of the most important stress factors affecting seed germination quality and crop yield. To investigate the Al tolerance on seed germination, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of 19,949 SNPs with genome-wide coverage was used to identify the candidate genes, which were potentially related to germinate traits of rapeseed(Brassica napus L.)under Al stress. In the experiment, 169 rapeseed cultivars (lines) were treated with AlCl(3)solution of 90 ppm, and distilled water was added to the control. At the 7th day, the phenotype data, including root length and dry weight, were measured and calculated. Using the TASSEL software, Al tolerance related traits were explored in rapeseed under germination with a 60 K Brassica Illumina (R) Infinium SNP array. Then, the structure of the population was analyzed with the STRUCTURE software, and the genetic relationship and LD attenuation were analyzed with the software TASSEL, respectively. The GWAS of relative root length (RRL) and relative dry weight (RDW) with SNP markers were carried out under the optimal model. Meanwhile, the candidate genes were predicted based on the LD interval sequence of the associated SNP locus. Subsequently, the homologous genes of rapeseed related to Al tolerance in the target genome region were screened inArabidopsis thaliana(L.) Heynh. The results showed that 13 SNPs were significantly associated with these two traits. Among them, 8 SNPs were significantly associated with RRL and located on chromosomes A03, A07, A09, A10, C05, C06, and C09, respectively. Five SNPs were significantly associated with RDW and located on chromosomes A03, A04, A10, C05, and C07, respectively. Afterward, fifty-nine candidate genes related to Al tolerance were identified in the LD region of these SNP loci. Four of these genes were involved in the growth regulation about organic acid, ten were involved in growth-regulating substance, eleven were related to oxidative stress, and nineteen were involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism.

WoS,Performance analysis of handover delay and buffer capacity in mobile OpenFlow-based networks,"Software-defined networking (SDN) is a network concept that brings significant benefits for the mobile cellular operators. In an SDN-based core network, the average service time of an OpenFlow switch is highly influenced by the total capacity and type of the output buffer, which is used for temporary storage of the incoming packets. In this work, the main goal is to model the handover delay due to the exchange of OpenFlow-related messages in mobile SDN networks. The handover delay is defined as the overall delay experienced by the mobile node within the handover procedure, when reestablishing an ongoing session from the switch in the source eNodeB to the switch in the destination eNodeB. We propose a new analytical model, and we compare two systems with different SDN switch designs that model a continuous time Markov process by using quasi-birth-death processes: (1) single shared buffer without priority (model SFB), used for all output ports for both control and user traffic, and (2) two isolated buffers with priority (model priority finite buffering [PFB]), one for control and the other for user plane traffic, where the control traffic is always prioritized. The two proposed systems are compared in terms of total handover delay and minimal buffer capacity needed to satisfy a certain packet error ratio imposed by the link. The mathematical modeling is verified via extensive simulations. In terms of handover delay, the results show that the model PFB outperforms the model SFB, especially for networks with high number of users and high probability of packet-in messages. As for the buffer dimensioning analysis, for lower arrival rates, low number of users, and low probability of packet-in messages, the model SFB has the advantage of requiring a smaller buffer size.",mobile networks; OpenFlow; performance evaluation; queueing model; SDN,"Panev, S; Latkoski, P",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS,10.1002/dac.4529,"[Panev, Strahil] Ericsson Telecommun Macedonia, Telecom Core & Cloud, Skopje, North Macedonia; [Latkoski, Pero] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Elect Engn & Informat Technol, Skopje, North Macedonia",WILEY,English,1074-5351,

Results OS was shorter for patients carrying TP53 mutation (MUT) than that of wild type (WT) (37.7 m vs 52.8 m;p = 0.040, HR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.89). Dual TP53/EGFR-MUT was associated with inferior OS compared with the dual WT/WT cohort (38.4 m vs 51.9 m;p = 0.023, HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.95-3.52). 316 DEGs between dual TP53/EGFR-MUT and dual WT/WT samples were obtained and functional analysis made known that DEGs were strikingly enriched in regulating the metabolism of important amino acids, cell division, cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix composition. KEGG analysis discovered that DEGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and extracellular matrix receptor interaction. PPI network suggested that GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY genes were up-regulated in dual mutation samples. OS in the high TMB cohort was significantly better than that in the low TMB in patients with TP53 MUT(43.2 m vs 32.4 m; P = 0.007, HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81), as well as in the combination of TP53 MUT and EGFR WT group (44.4 m vs 31.2 m; P = 0.021, HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 - 0.89). Conclusions TP53 MUT is a poor prognostic factor in LUAD patients, and the prognosis of TP53/EGFR co-mutation is worse. GPC3, CCL28, GPR37, and NPY may be novel prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for patients with dual TP53/EGFR mutation LUAD.",LUAD; EGFR; TP53; Co-mutation; SNPs; TMB,"Wang, F; Zhao, N; Gao, G; Deng, HB; Wang, ZH; Deng, LL; Yang, Y; Lu, CL",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY,10.1007/s00432-020-03340-5,"[Wang, Feng; Zhao, Ning; Wang, Zhi-Hui; Deng, Li-Li; Yang, Yu] Harbin Med Univ, Dept Oncol, Affiliated Hosp 2, 246 Xuefu Rd, Harbin 150086, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Gao, Ge] West China Hosp, Canc Ctr, Dept Thorac Oncol, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Deng, Hong-Bin] Harbin Med Univ, Dent Hosp, Affiliated Hosp 1, 23 Youzheng Rd, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Lu, Changlian] Shanghai Univ Med & Hlth Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Mol Imaging, Shanghai 201318, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,0171-5216,
WoS,Slice profile effects on quantitative analysis of hyperpolarized pyruvate,"Magnetic resonance imaging of hyperpolarized pyruvate provides a new imaging biomarker for cancer metabolism, based on the dynamic in vivo conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate. Methods for quantification of signal evolution need to be robust and reproducible across a range of experimental conditions. Pharmacokinetic analysis of dynamic spectroscopic imaging data from hyperpolarized pyruvate and its metabolites generally assumes that signal arises from ideal rectangular slice excitation profiles. In this study, we examined whether this assumption could lead to bias in kinetic analysis of hyperpolarized pyruvate and, if so, whether such a bias can be corrected. A Bloch-McConnell simulator was used to generate synthetic data using a known set of ground truth pharmacokinetic parameter values. Signal evolution was then analyzed using analysis software that either assumed a uniform slice profile, or incorporated information about the slice profile into the analysis. To correct for slice profile effects, the expected slice profile was subdivided into multiple sub-slices to account for variable excitation angles along the slice dimension. An ensemble of sub-slices was then used to fit the measured signal evolution. A mismatch between slice profiles used for data acquisition and those assumed during kinetic analysis was identified as a source of quantification bias. Results indicate that imperfect slice profiles preferentially increase detected lactate signal, leading to an overestimation of the apparent metabolic exchange rate. The slice profile-correction algorithm was tested in simulation, in phantom measurements, and applied to data acquired from a patient with prostate cancer. The results demonstrated that slice profile-induced biases can be minimized by accounting for the slice profile during pharmacokinetic analysis. This algorithm can be used to correct data from either single or multislice acquisitions.",hyperpolarized; pharmacokinetic analysis; pyruvate; quantitative imaging; slice profile,"Walker, CM; Gordon, JW; Xu, Z; Michel, KA; Li, L; Larson, PEZ; Vigneron, DB; Bankson, JA",2020.0,JournalEA,NMR IN BIOMEDICINE,10.1002/nbm.4373,"[Walker, Christopher M.; Xu, Zhan; Michel, Keith A.; Bankson, James A.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Imaging Phys, Unit 1902,1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gordon, Jeremy W.; Larson, Peder E.

WoS,Physiotherapists' experiences of early mobilization after stroke thrombolysis in England and Wales: A qualitative study,"Introduction Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator is a mainstream treatment for ischemic stroke. Known risks with thrombolysis include intracerebral hemorrhage and bleeding elsewhere in the body. There are no specific recommendations for the timing of commencing mobility rehabilitation after thrombolysis. Research evidence for early mobilization (within 24 hours) after thrombolysis is sparse and little is known about physiotherapy practice in the UK.Purpose: This exploratory study aimed to investigate the experiences, including clinical decision-making of physiotherapists in England and Wales regarding early mobilization after thrombolysis. Methods A qualitative study with interpretative paradigm using a phenomenological methodology. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample. Thematic analysis triangulated by participant and researcher review of resultant themes was supported by NVivo software. A reflexive diary was maintained throughout. Results Data saturation was reached after 14 interviews. All participants reported experience of early mobilization after thrombolysis, with no reported harm or serious incident. Themes included descriptions of practice, perceived benefits and harms, and implementation of risk assessment and management strategies. Conclusions Physiotherapists describe a variety of practices with careful implementation of any early mobilization after thrombolysis.

WoS,Effects of heat stress on reproductive efficiency in Holstein dairy cattle in the North African arid region,"This work aims to study the relationship between variations of the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) and the parameters of reproduction especially the first conception rate (FCR) and to determine the threshold THI value where cows' fertility rate dropped in 12 Holstein dairy herds raised in the arid climatic conditions of Tunisia. THI values were calculated over 22 years (1996-2018), and the mean monthly temperature and relative humidity data were obtained from the Meteorological Institute of Tunisia. A total of 20,396 individual records (Insemination and calving dates) were extracted from the Livestock and Pasturing Office (OEP, Tunisia) with regard to the highest THI before breeding, on the breeding day, and after breeding. Statistical analysis was performed using the GLM procedure of SAS software. Results point to the fact that a summer heat stress exists in southeast Tunisia and lasts for 4 months starting from June until September with THI values fluctuating between 73 +/- 2.38 and 79 +/- 3.01 exceeding, therefore, THI threshold of 72. Increased THI from <= 70 to >= 80 units was associated with drops in conception rate (CR) and fertility rate (FR) of 49% and 45% giving a correlation with the THI of (r = -.72,p < .05) and (r = -.74,p < .05), respectively. When cows were inseminated on extremely hot days (THI >= 80) preceded by cooler temperatures, pregnancy by service (P/AI) was 7% points higher than for other cows that were exposed to high temperatures before breeding. The average number of insemination was higher (p < .05) from THI <= 70 (2.01) compared to THI >= 80 (3.41). Cows calving during an absence of heat stress (THI <= 70) have the shortest average calving intervals (CI: 420 +/- 15.1 days). Contrastly, calving in the condition of heat stress (THI >= 80) has the longest CI (487 +/- 12.8 days). For each point increase in the THI value above 67, there is a decrease in the first conception rate by 1.39%. In this particular arid environment, high-yielding Holstein cows' breeding success is strongly affected by heat stress that takes place just before or after breeding.",conception rate; fertility; services per pregnancy; Temperature-Humidity Index,"Djelailia, H; Bouraoui, R; Jemmali, B; Najar, T",2020.0,JournalEA,REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS,10.1111/rda.13772,"[Djelailia, Hanane; Najar, Taha] Univ Carthage, Inst Natl Agron Tunisie, Lab Rech Mat Mol & Applicat, Tunis, Tunisia; [Bouraoui, Rachid; Jemmali, Bayrem] Univ Carthage, Higher Sch Agr Mateur, LR13AGR02 Lab ADIPARA, Rd Tabarka, Mateur 7030, Tunisia",WILEY,English,0936-6768,
WoS,Safety requirements for symbiotic human-robot collaboration systems in smart factories: a pairwise comparison approach to explore requirements dependencies,"Industry 4.0 is expected to deliver significant productivity gain taking advantage of Internet of things (IoT). Smart solutions, enhanced by IoT, are constantly driving revolutionary approaches in multiple domains. Smart factories are one domain where intelligent integrated robotic systems will revolutionize manufacturing, resulting in a complex ecosystem, where humans, robots and machinery are combined. In this setting, human safety requirements are of paramount importance. This paper focuses on symbiotic human-robot collaboration systems (HRC), where human safety requirements are essential. Hence, it aims to explore and prioritize human safety requirement dependencies, as well as their dependencies with other critical requirements of smart factory operation, as effectiveness and performance. Toward this end, the proposed approach is based on SysML to represent the requirements dependencies and pairwise comparisons, a fundamental decision-making method, to quantify the importance of these dependencies. This model-driven approach is used as the primary medium for conveying traceability among human safety requirements as well as traceability from safety requirements to effectiveness and performance requirements in the system model. The analysis is based on the operational requirements identified in the European project HORSE, which aims to develop a methodological/technical framework for easy adaptation of robotic solutions from small-/medium-sized enterprises. Validation of the results is also performed to further elaborate on human safety requirement dependency exploration. The outcomes of this paper may be beneficial for symbiotic HRC systems in the early design stage. As the system is being developed with an emphasis on human safety, all these requirements that have been assessed with highly prioritized dependencies should be taken into account, whereas those with negligible ones have to be ignored since they do not significantly affect the rest of the process. Since operational requirements may be conflicted and incompatible, this approach may be very useful for other systems as well during the system design phase to find the appropriate solution satisfying the majority of the requirements, giving a priority to the ones with highly ranked dependencies and hence facilitating the implementation phase and afterward the production line. The outcomes may be used as a step in developing a model-driven approach which should be able to support the manufacturing process, facilitating the integration of systems and software modeling, which is increasingly important for robotic systems in smart factories incorporating HRC.",Symbiotic human-robot collaboration systems; Safety; Requirement analysis; Dependencies; SysML; Decision making; Pairwise comparison,"Dede, G; Mitropoulou, P; Nikolaidou, M; Kamalakis, T; Michalakelis, C",2020.0,JournalEA,REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING,10.1007/s00766-020-00337-x,"[Dede, Georgia; Mitropoulou, Persefoni; Nikolaidou, Mara; Kamalakis, Thomas; Michalakelis, Christos] Harokopio Univ, Dept Informat & Telemat, Kallithea, Greece",SPRINGER,English,0947-3602,
WoS,Thermal Desorption Spectra of H in an Fe-C-Nb Alloy Evaluated by Diffusion Simulation,"In this work, cell-based numerical long-range diffusion calculations for hydrogen in steel are conducted to simulate the diffusion characteristics of H in the presence of atomic traps, in particular, carbides. The charging of alloys with H from the gaseous phase and the effusion during storage and thermal desorption are initially simulated. To account for the influence of NbC traps, thermokinetic simulations with the software package MatCalc are used to predict the evolution of the size distribution of precipitates during the prescribed heat treatment. The calculated precipitate sizes are compared to experimental results obtained from transmission electron microscopy. The thermal desorption spectra from the diffusion simulation are finally compared with the measured data, thus demonstrating the potential of the present simulation framework for academic studies and industrial applications related to H uptake and desorption.",diffusion; hydrogen; NbC; simulations; thermal desorption spectroscopy; trapping,"Zugner, D; Zamberger, S; Yigit, N; Rupprechter, G; Kozeschnik, E",2020.0,JournalEA,STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,10.1002/srin.202000240,"[Zuegner, Dominik; Zamberger, Sabine] Voestalpine Forsch Serv Gesell Donawitz, Computat Mat Engn, Kerpelystr 199, A-8700 Leoben, Austria; [Yigit, Nevzat; Rupprechter, Guenther] TU Wien, Inst Mat Chem, Getreidemarkt 9, A-1060 Vienna, Austria; [Kozeschnik, Ernst] TU Wien, Inst Mat Sci & Technol, Getreidemarkt 9, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,English,1611-3683,
WoS,Does piracy lead to product abandonment or stimulate new product development?: Evidence from mobileplatform-baseddeveloper firms,"Research Summary With the growth of digital platforms, understanding the role of property rights on those platforms has become increasingly important. Digital piracy, the unauthorized copying and distribution of digital products, is therefore an important strategic issue, both because of lost revenues and because it is thought to decrease innovation. Yet, while the latter effect is often argued, empirical evidence is limited. We study whether piracy affects innovation and whether it leads firms to shift to different types of innovations. By studying a large piracy event in a mobile app marketplace, we find that piracy leads to a decrease in the release of incremental innovations, such as bug fixes, but does not decrease more substantial revisions. Additionally, it is associated with subsequent new product development. Managerial For many platform companies, a critical issue is understanding how piracy and imitation should be regulated, motivated in part by a common narrative that piracy will eliminate innovation on these platforms. The present article suggests that these effects are slightly more nuanced. We find that piracy does lead to a decline in incremental innovations, such as bug fixes or appearance tweaks, but no discernible decline in more major innovations, such as feature updates or entirely new versions. This implies that piracy can shape the type of innovation, potentially leading to products that are less polished and refined but not affecting the overall level of innovation.",digital innovation; digital piracy; mobile applications; new product development; platforms,"Miric, M; Jeppesen, LB",2020.0,JournalEA,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,10.1002/smj.3208,"[Miric, Milan] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Jeppesen, Lars Bo] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",WILEY,English,0143-2095,
WoS,Optical coherence tomography of the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) eye,"Objective To provide images of the anterior and posterior structures of the gecko eye using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Animals and procedures Eight ophthalmologically normal Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko) were used. The nose-cloaca distance and body weight were measured for each gecko. Tomographic images were obtained using SD-OCT without the use of anesthetic or mydriatic agents. The central corneal thickness (CCT), the anterior chamber depth (ACD), and the length of the conus papillaris (CP) were manually measured using OCT images. The thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) around the CP and the retinal thickness in all four quadrants (superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal areas) were automatically measured using the OCT software program. Results The mean values of the nose-cloaca distance and body weight were 13.8 +/- 0.9 cm and 41.3 +/- 9.0 g, respectively. The mean values of CCT, ACD, and CP length were 177.6 +/- 20.9 mu m, 1205.0 +/- 79.9 mu m, and 1546.4 +/- 208.8 mu m, respectively. The mean value of RNFL thickness was 52.0 +/- 8.2 mu m, and the superior region was the thickest. The mean value of total retinal thickness was 202.5 +/- 9.4 mu m, and the temporal region was the thickest.

WoS,Computer-based evaluation to assess students' learning for the multiple-choice question-based exams: CBE-MCQs software tool,"In this study, a computer-based evaluation (CBE) software tool, namely CBE-MCQs, is proposed to assist the instructor to evaluate and analyze traditional classroom-based exams, which include multiple-choice questions (MCQs) reliably, quickly, and automatically. Using the proposed CBE-MCQs software tool while performing question analysis, the learning outcome-based analyzes are performed by matching the learning outcomes of the courses with the exam questions. With question-based evaluations, item analyzes such as item difficulty, item discrimination, and item distracters can be made easily. Also, with the question-based evaluation, the instructor of the course can effectively measure the extent to which students achieve the learning outcomes of the related course. Thus, the CBE-MCQs tool helps successful maintenance of both accreditation and training processes with the analysis it provides to the instructors. In addition, the final exam assessment of the course based on MCQs within the scope of the case study was carried out with the CBE-MCQs software tool. Each MCQ was evaluated based on classical theory within the scope of difficulty index (P), discrimination index (D), and distracter efficiency (DE). It is observed that association betweenDandPwas statistically significant according to Pearson correlation (r = -0.600) and chi(2)(chi(2) = 15.98,df = 8;alpha = 0.05). Also, a system usability survey of 10 statements was applied to the instructors using this software to evaluate the usability of the CBE-MCQs software tool. As a result of a series of experimental studies and survey, the developed CBE-MCQs software tool is evaluated as simple, effective, and satisfactory by 87.4% of the instructors.",assessment; computer-based evaluation; learning outcomes-based analysis; multiple-choice questions; question-based analysis; software tool,"Solak, S; Ucar, MHB; Albadwieh, M",2020.0,JournalEA,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,10.1002/cae.22309,"[Solak, Serdar; Ucar, Mustafa H.

WoS,Tutorial on Biostatistics: Longitudinal Analysis of Correlated Continuous Eye Data,"Purpose: To describe and demonstrate methods for analyzing longitudinal correlated eye data with a continuous outcome measure. Methods: We described fixed effects, mixed effects and generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, applied them to data from the Complications of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial (CAPT) and the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS). In CAPT (N = 1052), we assessed the effect of eye-specific laser treatment on change in visual acuity (VA). In the AREDS study, we evaluated effects of systemic supplement treatment among 1463 participants with AMD category 3. Results: In CAPT, the inter-eye correlations (0.33 to 0.53) and longitudinal correlations (0.31 to 0.88) varied. There was a small treatment effect on VA change (approximately one letter) at 24 months for all three models (p= .009 to 0.02). Model fit was better with the mixed effects model than the fixed effects model (p< .001). In AREDS, there was no significant treatment effect in all models (p> .55). Current smokers had a significantly greater VA decline than non-current smokers in the fixed effects model (p= .04) and the mixed effects model with random intercept (p= .0003), but marginally significant in the mixed effects model with random intercept and slope (p= .08), and GEE models (p= .054 to 0.07). The model fit was better with the fixed effects model than the mixed effects model (p< .0001). Conclusion: Longitudinal models using the eye as the unit of analysis can be implemented using available statistical software to account for both inter-eye and longitudinal correlations.

WoS,"Onabotulinumtoxin Type A reconstitution with preserved versus preservative-free saline in chronic migraine (B-RECON). A randomised, double-blind trial","Introduction Onabotulinumtoxin type A (BoNTA) is manufactured as powder that requires reconstitution with normal saline prior to injection. Previous literature has suggested that preserved saline (PS) exerts a local anaesthetic effect, and reduces the procedure discomfort when used in reconstitution in lieu of preservative-free saline (PFS). However, this was mainly studied in the aesthetics indications of BoNTA, and never in its use for the treatment of chronic migraine. The distinction is important as chronic migraine population suffers high incidence of scalp allodynia which makes it more prone to injection site pain. In addition, the pain of the procedure itself may be related to the spike of migraine frequency in the immediate postprocedural period which can occur in up to 5% of patients receiving the treatment. Our trial aimed to study the difference in procedural pain scale, and postprocedural headache rating with the use of PS vs PFS in constitution of BoNTA when used as a treatment for chronic migraine. Methods 68 subjects were consecutively enrolled in an outpatient setting at a large tertiary headache centre over a period of 6 months. Subjects were randomised into PS or PFS group. BoNTA was administered as per standard protocol in both groups. Injection site pain scores and frequency of headache days in the immediate following week were recorded. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare differences in between groups using SPSS software. Results Analysis (SAS V 9.4) revealed that those receiving [PF] had significantly higher procedure pain scores than those receiving [P] (5.3 vs 3.2, respectively). There was no difference in the headache or migraine frequency in the immediate postprocedural period. Conclusion This study supports the use of PS (bacteriostatic) over PFS for reconstitution of BoNTA in chronic migraine as it reduces the discomfort of the injection sites.",,"Zidan, A; Hussaini, S; Gibson, S; Brooks, G; Mejico, L",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE,10.1111/ijcp.13522,"[Zidan, Awss; Hussaini, Sharmeen; Gibson, Sandra; Mejico, Luis] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Dept Neurol, 750 East Adams St, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Brooks, Gary] SUNY Upstate Med Univ, Ctr Res & Evaluat, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",WILEY,English,1368-5031,
WoS,The relationship between maternal anemia during pregnancy with preterm birth: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective:Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia during pregnancy. Other causes of anemia include parasitic diseases, micronutrient deficiencies, and genetic hemoglobin apathies. Maternal anemia during pregnancy is the most important public health problem. Since the relationship between maternal anemia by the months of pregnancy and premature birth has been reported differently in various studies; thus, this study aims to determine the relationship between maternal anemia during pregnancy and premature birth. Methods:This systematic review and meta-analysis article was designed based on the recommendations of PRISMA. This study was performed from 1990 to 2018. Articles extracted using related keywords such as maternal, anemia, premature birth, and pregnancy in databases, including Cochrane, Medline, Medlib, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Springer, Science Direct, Embase, Google Scholar, Sid, Irandoc, Iranmedex, and Magiran. Relative risk and its confidence interval were extracted from each of the studies. The random effects model was used to combine study results and heterogeneity among the studies measured using I(2)index and the data were analyzed based by using STATA software version 3.2. Results:Overall 18 studies with sample sizes of 932 090 were entered into the meta-analysis. The overall relationship between maternal anemia during pregnancy and premature birth was significant (1.56 [95% CI: 1.25-1.95]). Maternal anemia in the first trimester increases the risk of premature birth (relative risk, 1.65 [95% CI: 1.31-2.08]). But, this relationship was not significant in the second (relative risk, 1.45 [95% CI: 0.79-2.65]) and third trimester (relative risk, 1.43 [95% CI: 0.82-2.51]).

WoS,Toward large-scale simulation of residual stress and distortion in wire and arc additive manufacturing,"This study aims to advance the structural analysis of wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) by considering the thermomechanical features inherent in direct energy deposition. Simulation approaches including the iterative substructure method (ISM), dynamic mesh refining method (DMRM), and graphics processing unit (GPU) based explicit finite element method (FEM) were developed for accelerating additive manufacturing stress analysis that is very time consuming by conventional numerical methods. ISM and DMRM take advantage of the strong nonlinearity phenomenon near the moving heat source by reducing the global iterations and refining the local mesh, respectively. In addition to the use of GPUs, the explicit FEM is accelerated by a time scaling technique based on the inherent strain concept. The residual stress and distortion of two large builds were analyzed, showing very consistent numerical results and good agreement with experiments. Compared with the commercial software Abaqus, the novel approaches reduced the computational cost substantially without compromising accuracy. The GPU code showed the highest computational efficiency (30 similar to 70x), while DMRM and ISM had acceleration factors of 9x and 3x, respectively.

Methods A literature search was conducted through databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Databases (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (SinoMed), Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and Wanfang Database up to August 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CHMs with placebo or no additional treatments on the basis of standard conventional pharmacological therapies were included. Data extraction, analyses and quality assessment were performed according to the Cochrane standards. RevMan 5.3 software was used to synthesize the results. Results A total of 16 RCTs enrolling 1,443 participants were included in this systematic review. When compared with antidepressants alone, CHMs showed similar benefits with less side effects [risk ratio=0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.69, 582 patients]; meanwhile, the combination therapy may have more advantages than antidepressants alone [mean difference (MD)=-1.03, 95%CI-1.81 to-0.25, 267 patients). When identified with placebo, CHMs seem to have more advantages in relieving depressive symptoms (MD=-19.00, 95%CI-20.02 to-17.98, 189 patients). However, when compared with basic treatment of post- PCI, CHMs showed different results in two trials. In terms of post-PCI related clinical symptoms, CHMs seem to have more advantages in relieving chest pain and other general clinical symptoms. However, the heterogeneity in this review was generally high, it may be caused by different interventions used in each trial and the low quality of the trials. Conclusions In total, CHMs showed potentially beneficial effects on depressive symptoms and post-PCI related clinical symptoms. However, because of small sample size and potential bias of most trials, this result should be interpreted with caution. More rigorous trials with larger sample size and higher quality are warranted to give high quality of evidence to support the use of CHMs for CHD complicated with depression.",Chinese herbal medicine; post-percutaneous coronary intervention patients; meta-analysis; systematic review,"Xue, YJ; Xie, Y; Zhao, GL; Zhou, BD; Li, K; Li, SY; Zhang, P",2020.0,Review,CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE,10.1007/s11655-019-2702-x,"[Xue, Ya-jun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Clin Med, Grad Sch, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xie, Ying; Zhou, Bo-da; Li, Kun; Li, Si-yuan; Zhang, Ping] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hosp, Sch Clin Med, Dept Cardiol, Beijing 102218, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Guo-liang] Shanxi Tumour Hosp, Taiyuan 030013, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,1672-0415,

WoS,Tweeting the cosmos: On the bot poetry ofThe Ephemerides,"This article discusses Twitter bots that generate textual outputs for aesthetic effect. It considers in-detail a specific instance,The Ephemerides() by Allison Parrish, and presents a critical assessment of how its functional and thematic attributes meditate self-reflexively upon their operational contexts within digital infrastructure. This mode of reading is then presented as having value for analysing generative Twitter bots more widely. The initial balance of this article will concern the broader question of how generative digital writing can be assessed critically, debating key claims made by Simanowski (2011), before presenting a model in which the salient quality of this art form is the distinctly machinic modes of expression it makes available, revealing the software itself to be an active agent in the reading encounter. The remainder of this article will then apply this perspective to a reading ofThe Ephemerides, considering its meditation on the functional and aesthetic relationship between technical systems that are unobtrusively efficient versus those that are vividly breaking down - with the latter making manifest the contingency that is inherent to the processes of coming to know and act on the world through technology. The goal of this discussion is to consider not only how the generative operations of Twitter bots might be approached fruitfully, but to demonstrate also that such analyses constitute a worthwhile pursuit in the first instance - that even these tightly constrained instances of digital creativity can offer forms expression that reward extended academic criticism.",Databases; electronic literature; generative art; networks; non-human agency; software studies; text generation; Twitter bots,"Carter, RA",2020.0,Journal,CONVERGENCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH INTO NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES,10.1177/1354856519837796,"[Carter, Richard A.] Univ Roehampton, Digital Media, London, England",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,English,1354-8565,

WoS,"Unfilled Prescriptions of Medicare Beneficiaries: Prevalence, Reasons, and Types of Medicines Prescribed","BACKGROUND: Despite the proven efficacy of prescription regimens in reducing disease symptoms and preventing or minimizing complications, poor medication adherence remains a significant public health problem. Medicare beneficiaries have high rates of chronic illness and prescription medication use, making this population particularly vulnerable to nonadherence. Failure to fill prescribed medication is a key component of nonadherence. OBJECTIVES: To (1) determine the rates of self-reported failure to fill at least 1 prescription among a sample of Medicare beneficiaries in 2004, (2) identify the reasons for not filling prescribed medication, (3) examine the characteristics of Medicare beneficiaries who failed to fill their prescription(s), and (4) identify the types of medications that were not obtained. METHODS: The study is a secondary analysis of the 2004 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), an ongoing national panel survey conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Medicare beneficiaries living in the community (N = 14,464) were asked: During the current year [2004], were there any medicines prescribed for you that you did not get (please include refills of earlier prescriptions as well as prescriptions that were written or phoned in by a doctor)? Those who responded yes to this question (n = 664) were asked to identify the specific medication(s) not obtained. Rates of failure to fill were compared by demographic and income categories and for respondents with versus without self-reported chronic conditions, identified by asking respondents if they had ever been told by a doctor that they had the condition. Weighted population estimates for nonadherence were calculated using Professional Software for Survey Data Analysis for Multi-stage Sample Designs (SUDAAN) to account for the MCBS multistage stratified cluster sampling process. Unweighted counts of the prescriptions not filled by therapeutic class were calculated using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS). RESULTS: In 2004, an estimated 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries (4.4%) failed to fill or refill 1 or more prescriptions. The most common reasons cited for failure to fill were: thought it would cost too much (55.5%), followed by medicine not covered by insurance (20.2%), didn't think medicine was necessary for the condition (18.0%), and was afraid of medicine reactions/contraindications (11.8%). Rates of failure to fill were significantly higher among Medicare beneficiaries aged 18 to 64 years eligible through Social Security Disability Insurance (10.4%) than among beneficiaries aged 65 years or older (3.3%, P < 0.001). Rates were slightly higher for women than for men (5.0 vs. 3.6%, P = 0.001), for nonwhite than for white respondents (5.5% vs. 4.2%, P = 0.010), and for dually eligible Medicaid beneficiaries than for those who did not have Medicaid coverage (6.3% vs. 4.0% P = 0.001). Failure-to-fill rates were significantly higher among beneficiaries with psychiatric conditions (8.0%, P < 0.001); arthritis (5.2%, P < 0.001); cardiovascular disease (5.2%, P = 0.003); and emphysema, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6.6%, P < 0.001) than among respondents who did not report those conditions, and the rate for respondents who reported no chronic conditions was 2.5%. Rates were higher for those with more self-reported chronic conditions (3.2%, 4.0%, 4.3%, and 5.9% for those with 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more conditions, respectively, P < 0.001). Among the prescriptions not filled (993 prescriptions indentified by 664 respondents), central nervous system agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were most frequently identified (23.6%, n = 234), followed by cardiovascular agents (18.3%, n = 182) and endocrine/metabolic agents (6.5%, n = 65). Of the reported unfilled prescriptions, 8.1% were for antihyperlipidemic agents, 5.4% were for antidepressant drugs, 4.6% were for antibiotics, and 29.9% were for unidentified therapy classes. CONCLUSION: Most Medicare beneficiaries fill their prescriptions, but some subpopulations are at significantly higher risk for nonadherence associated with unfilled prescriptions, including working-age beneficiaries, dual-eligible beneficiaries, and beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. Self-reported unfilled prescriptions included critical medications for treatment of acute and chronic disease, including antihyperlipidemic agents, antidepressants, and antibiotics.

WoS,Adaptability of Teff husk activated carbon for removal of hexavalent chromium from tannery wastewater at optimized process condition,"Tanneries are the major contributors to chromium pollution of the environment. Exposure to chromium (VI) can cause cancer, brain damage, central nervous dysfunction, blood composition damage; damage of lungs, kidneys, liver, and other vital organs. Although various studies have been done on the removal of Cr (VI) from synthetic wastewater, there is a lack of study in the adaptability of these methods in the treatment of real wastewater and expanding to the industrial application level. Therefore, the present study was aimed to examine the effectiveness of Teff husk activated carbon for the removal of Cr (VI) from tannery wastewater at optimized process conditions. The laboratory-based study was conducted to determine the Cr (VI) removal efficiency of Teff husk activated carbon from tannery wastewater. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. A paired samplettest was also used to test the presence of a significant difference in the mean concentration of Cr (VI) before and after treatment of the wastewater with Teff husk activated carbon. Thenpvalue < 0.05 was considered as a cutoff point for the presence of a mean significant difference. The removal efficiency was found to be 89.5%. There was a significant difference in the mean concentration of Cr (VI) before and after treatment with Teff husk activated carbon witha = 956.899 andpvalue < 0.001. This implies the Teff husk activated carbon was an efficient adsorbent for removal of hexavalent chromium from real wastewater.

WoS,Association between peripheral blood levels of C-reactive protein and Autism Spectrum Disorder in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: In the past five years, a growing number of studies have tried to illustrate the association between the peripheral blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However, the results have been inconsistent. To assess whether abnormal CRP in peripheral blood was associated with ASD, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using the Embase, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases through August 27, 2019. Reference lists were also checked by hand-searching. Clinical studies exploring CRP concentration in the peripheral blood of autistic children and healthy controls were included in our meta-analysis. Overlapping samples were excluded. We pooled obtained data using a fixed- or random-effect model based on a heterogeneity test with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software and STATA software. Standardized mean differences were converted to Hedges' g statistic in order to obtain the effect size adjusted for sample size. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, meta-regression, and publication bias tests were also undertaken. Results: Nine studies with 592 ASD children and 604 healthy children were included in our meta-analysis. Significantly elevated CRP levels in peripheral blood were found in ASD children compared with healthy controls (Hedges' g = 0.527, 95% CI: 0.224-0.830, p = 0.001). Subgroup analyses based on sample types and ethnicity also showed similar results, except for the plasma subgroup. There was also a significant association between peripheral CRP concentration and ASD after removing the studies identified by Galbraith plots. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that no single study could reverse our results. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the gender of autistic children had a moderating effect on the outcome of the meta-analysis. In addition, no obvious publication bias was found in the meta-analysis. Conclusions and relevance: In our study, peripheral CRP levels were significantly elevated in autistic children compared with healthy children. These results may provide us some new insights about ASD.",C-reactive protein; Autism Spectrum Disorders; Peripheral blood,"Yin, FN; Wang, HB; Liu, ZY; Gao, JW",2020.0,Review,BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.008,"[Yin, Fangna] Cangzhou Cent Hosp, Clin Lab, Cangzhou 061000, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongbing] Cangzhou Cent Hosp, Dept Radiotherapy Oncol, Cangzhou 061000, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zeya] China Japan Friendship Hosp, Dept Blood Transfus, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Gao, Junwei] Army Med Univ, Third Mil Med Univ, Sch Psychol, Dept Dev Neuropsychol, Chongqing 400038, Peoples R China",ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,English,0889-1591,
WoS,Nose approximation among South African groups from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using a new computer-assisted method based on automatic landmarking,"Considering the high demand for the identification of unknown remains in South Africa, a need exists to establish reliable facial approximation techniques that will take into account sex and age and, most importantly, be useful within the South African context. This study aimed to provide accurate statistical models for predicting nasal soft-tissue shape from information about the underlying skull subtract among a South African sample. The database containing 200 cone-beam computer tomography (CBCT) scans (100 black South Africans and 100 white South Africans). The acquisition and extraction of the 3D relevant anatomical structures (hard- and soft-tissue) were performed by an automated three-dimensional (3D) method based on an automatic dense landmarking procedure using MeVisLab (c) v. 2.7.1 software. An evaluation of shape differences attributed to known factors (ancestry, sex, size, and age) was performed using geometric morphometric and statistical models of prediction were created using a Projection onto Latent Structures Regression (PLSR) algorithm. The accuracy of the estimated soft-tissue nose was evaluated in terms of metric deviations on training and un-trained datasets. Our findings demonstrated the influence of factors (sex, aging, and allometry) on the variability of the hard- and soft-tissue among two South African population groups. This research provides accurate statistical models optimized by including additional information such as ancestry, sex, and age. When using the landmark-to landmark distances, the prediction errors ranged between 1.769 mm and 2.164 mm for black South Africans at the tip of the nose and the alae, while they ranged from 2.068 mm to 2.175 mm for the white subsample. The prediction errors on un-trained data were slightly larger, ranging between 2.139 mm and 2.833 mm for the black South African sample at the tip of the nose and the alae and ranging from 2.575 mm to 2.859 mm for the white South African sample. This research demonstrates the utilization of an automated 3Dmethod based on an automatic landmarking method as a convenient prerequisite for providing a valid and reliable nose prediction model that meets population-specific standards for South Africans.

WoS,Analysis of carpal bones on MR images for age estimation: First results of a new forensic approach,"Current multifactorial age estimation methods are based on radiography, however, in the forensic field there is growing interest in using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With regard to the carpal region, MRI provides more information for defining the individual ossification nuclei and the cartilage surrounding single bones. During the phase of bone growth, the progressive reduction of the cartilage layer is accompanied by the development of a cartilage-bone interface. The aim of our study was to create a new model for age estimation, based on the ratio between the area occupied by the nucleus of ossification (NO) and the surface of growth (SG) of each carpal bone, the latter derived by adding NO to the area of cartilage-bone interface. We analyzed 57 MRI scans of Italian subjects aged between 12 and 20 years, without growth diseases, endocrine disorders or osteodystrophy. Measurements of NO and SG areas were extracted using ImageJ software, and the ratio between the NO and SG of each bone (NOSG) was calculated. A multiple linear regression model was used to estimate the individual's age as a function of the variables: gender and wrist bone measurements. The results showed that the best model was obtained with 6 predictors (nvmax = 6): Gender, and the NOSG of the Trapezoid, Trapezium, Scaphoid, Pisiform, and Capitate. The median of the residuals (observed age minus predicted age) was -0.025 years, with an IQR of 0.19 years. Thus a new forensic approach to age assessment using MRI is introduced in this paper, which gives the preliminary results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Evolutionary Black-Box Topology Optimization: Challenges and Promises,"Black-box topology optimization (BBTO) uses evolutionary algorithms and other soft computing techniques to generate near-optimal topologies of mechanical structures. Although evolutionary algorithms are widely used to compensate the limited applicability of conventional gradient optimization techniques, methods based on BBTO have been criticized due to numerous drawbacks. In this article, we discuss topology optimization as a black-box optimization problem. We review the main BBTO methods, discuss their challenges and present approaches to relax them. Dealing with those challenges effectively can lead to wider applicability of topology optimization, as well as the ability to tackle industrial, highly constrained, nonlinear, many-objective, and multimodal problems. Consequently, future research in this area may open the door for innovating new applications in science and engineering that may go beyond solving classical optimization problems of mechanical structures.

WoS,Paradoxes in Numerical Comparison of Optimization Algorithms,"Numerical comparison is often key to verifying the performance of optimization algorithms, especially, global optimization algorithms. However, studies have so far neglected issues concerning comparison strategies necessary to rank optimization algorithms properly. To fill this gap for the first time, we combine voting theory and numerical comparison research areas, which have been disjoint so far, and thus extend the results of the former to the latter for optimization algorithms. In particular, we investigate compatibility issues arising from comparing two and more than two algorithms, termed C2 and C2+ in this article, respectively. Through defining and modeling C2 and C2+ mathematically, it is uncovered and illustrated that numerical comparison can be incompatible. Further, two possible paradoxes, namely, cycle ranking and survival of the nonfittest, are discovered and analyzed rigorously. The occurrence probabilities of these two paradoxes are also calculated under the no-free-lunch assumption, which shows the first justifiable use of the impartial culture assumption from voting theory, providing a point of reference to the frequency of the paradoxes occurring. It is also shown that significant influence on these probabilities comes from the number of algorithms and the number of optimization problems studied in the comparison. Further, various limiting probabilities when the number of optimization problems goes to infinity are also derived and characterized. The results would help guide benchmarking and developing optimization and machine learning algorithms.",Optimization; Benchmark testing; Mathematical model; Numerical models; Machine learning algorithms; Measurement; Convergence; Cycle ranking; evolutionary computation; machine learning; numerical comparison; optimization,"Liu, QF; Gehrlein, WV; Wang, L; Yan, Y; Cao, YY; Chen, W; Li, Y",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION,10.1109/TEVC.2019.2955110,"[Liu, Qunfeng; Yan, Yuan; Chen, Wei; Li, Yun] Dongguan Univ Technol, Dongguan Ind Artificial Intelligence Lab 4 0, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qunfeng; Yan, Yuan; Cao, Yingying; Chen, Wei; Li, Yun] Dongguan Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China; [Gehrlein, William V.] Univ Delaware, Dept Business Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Wang, Ling] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,1089-778X,
WoS,Tackling Uncertainty for the Development of Efficient Decision Support System in Air Traffic Management,"Airport capacity has become a constraint in the air transportation networks due to the growth of air traffic demand and the lack of resources able to accommodate this demand. This paper presents the algorithmic implementations of a decision support system for making a more efficient use of the airspace and ground capacity. The system would be able to provide support for air traffic controllers in handling large amount of flights while reducing to a minimum potential conflicts. In this framework, airspace together with ground airport operations is considered. The conflicts are defined as separation minima violation between aircraft for what concerns airspace and runways and as capacity overloads for taxiway network and terminals. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of an iterative approach that couples optimization and simulation to find solutions that are resilient to perturbations due to the uncertainty present in different phases of the arrival and departure process. An optimization model was employed to find a (sub)optimal solution, while a discrete event-based simulation model evaluated the objective function. By coupling simulation with optimization, we generate more robust solutions resilient to variability in the operations, and this is supported by a case study of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.",Atmospheric modeling; Airports; Optimization; Uncertainty; Aircraft; Analytical models; Software; Airport; airspace; optimization; simulation; uncertainty,"Scala, P; Mota, MM; Ma, J; Delahaye, D",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS,10.1109/TITS.2019.2924981,"[Scala, Paolo; Mota, Miguel Mujica] Amsterdam Univ Appl Sci, Aviat Acad, NL-1097 DZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ma, Ji; Delahaye, Daniel] Ecole Natl Aviat Civile, F-35100 Toulouse, France",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,1524-9050,

Diagnostic casts obtained at 2 time points and the complete denture were scanned by using a desktop scanner. The denture scan was inverted by using a metrology software program to obtain the soft tissue contour. Using this reversed file as a reference, the file and 2 scan files obtained at different time points were aligned individually with the best fit alignment function. The scanned denture file and the 2 realigned scan files were imported into the same software. A plane vertical to the occlusal plane was determined such that it moved anteroposteriorly.

WoS,Evaluation of gamma ray shielding characteristics of CaF2-BaO-P2O5 glass system using Phy-X / PSD computer program,"In this work, we reported the gamma ray shielding factors for barium phosphate glasses with composition yCaF(2)-(50-y)BaO-50P(2)O(5) (y = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mol%). The Phy-X/PSD software has been used to report the attenuation and penetration factors for this glass system at different energies. The linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) values are found to reduce exponentially with increasing the energy and they range from 0.176 to 0.496 cm(-1) (for CaBaP1) and 0.184-0.548 cm(-1) (for CaBaP6). It was found that the addition of barium oxide (BaO) causes an increase in the LAC values from 0.697 to 0.787 cm(-1) at 0.284 MeV, and from 0.259 to 0.273 cm(-1) at 0.662 MeV. The effective atomic number (Z(eff)) results revealed the higher photons interaction possibility at the higher BaO content. The maximum Z(eff )is reported at 0.284 MeV and equal to 18.33 for CaBaP1 and 20.15 for CaBaP6. Phy-X/PSD program has been used to find the half value layer (HVL) for the glasses under evaluation between 0.284 and 1.33 MeV. The HVL results showed that more gamma rays are being shielded at 0.284 MeV, whereas the possibility of photon shielding is decreased with the increasing of the energy. The tenth value layer (TVL) values were decreased with increase in BaO concentrations and increased with increase in the energy. CaBaP6 has the minimum TVL (4.206 cm at 0.284 MeV, 8.445 cm at 0.662 MeV and 12.252 cm at 1.275 MeV).",Gamma radiation; Attenuation; Effective atomic number; Phy-X; PSD; Phosphate glasses,"Al-Hadeethi, Y; Sayyed, MI",2020.0,Journal,PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY,10.1016/j.pnucene.2020.103397,"[Al-Hadeethi, Y.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Sayyed, M., I] Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ IAU, Inst Res & Med Consultat IRMC, Dept Nucl Med Res, Dammam, Saudi Arabia; [Sayyed, M., I] Univ Tabuk, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0149-1970,
WoS,"Application of experimental measurements, Monte Carlo simulation and theoretical calculation to estimate the gamma ray shielding capacity of various natural rocks","Experimental measurements and Monte Carlo simulation were applied to simulate the mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) for five various rock samples collected from southwestern Sinai, Egypt. Also, for the same rocks we determined the MAC and exposure buildup factors (EBF and EABF) theoretically using Phy-X/PSD software. The results show that there is adequate agreement between experimental and simulated results as well as with the Phy-X/PSD data. The linear attenuation coefficient (mu) decreases as the photon energy increases. The decrease is dramatically steep for energies bellow 0.3445 MeV and then gradually decreases with further increasing in the energy. Basalt-2 has slightly higher u than basalt-1 and both rocks have higher u than limestone (Dike), Basalt sill, and Rhyolite. We also calculated the effective atomic number (Z(eff)) for the investigated rocks and the Z(eff) values are in the range of 18.80-23.68, 18.52-23.57, 13.98-20.49, 19.15-23.89 and 22.32-26.68 for baslat-1, basalt-2, dike, basalt-sill and rhyolite respectively. The result showed that basalt-2 possesses the lowest half value layer at all energies followed by basalt-1. The radiation protection efficiency (RPE) at 122 keV is found to be in the range of 34.295-38.982%, while at 662 keV in the range of 17.402-22.886.

WoS,Hsa-let-7c exerts an anti-tumor function by negatively regulating ANP32E in lung adenocarcinoma,"We attempted to investigate the relationship between hsa-let-7c and ANP32E, as well as their influence on the cells phenotype of lung adenocarcinoma. Expression of hsa-let-7c and prognostic values were assessed by bioinformatics analysis based on TCGA database. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot was employed to measure relative expression of hsa-let-7c or ANP32E. The targeting relationship between let-7c and ANP32E was predicted by biological software and validated by dual luciferase reporter assay. With gene transfection technology, cell proliferation, invasion and migration were appraised by cell counting Kit-8, clone formation and Transwell assays. The results showed that hsa-let-7c was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. Downregulation of hsa-let-7c notably led to a poor survival. ANP32E was forecasted and confirmed as a directly target of hsa-let-7c, and was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, upregulation of ANP32E had a significant correlation with unsatisfactory survival. Meanwhile, the levels of ANP32E were negatively regulated by hsa-let-7c. Upregulation of hsa-let-7c remarkably suppressed the Calu-3 cell proliferation, invasion and migration, while ANP32E overexpression plasmids rescued the downtrend. Inversely, hsa-let-7c silencing in NCI-H209 cells presented the opposite outcomes. Collectively, hsa-let-7c shows an anti-tumor effect in lung adenocarcinoma by targeting ANP32E and is expected to be a potential therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma.",let-7c; ANP32E; Lung adenocarcinoma; Proliferation; Invasion and migration,"Wang, L; Li, J; Li, Y; Pang, LB",2020.0,Journal,TISSUE & CELL,10.1016/j.tice.2020.101372,"[Wang, Lei] Shandong Jining 1 Peoples Hosp, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Jining 272001, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Jun; Pang, Long-Bin] Shandong Univ, Jinan Cent Hosp, Cheeloo Coll Med, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, 105 Jiefang Rd, Jinan 250013, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan] Jining Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Jining 272000, Shandong, Peoples R China",CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,English,0040-8166,
WoS,Texture analysis on bi-parametric MRI for evaluation of aggressiveness in patients with prostate cancer,"Purpose To evaluate the association between texture parameters based on bi-parametric MRI and Gleason score (GS) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and to evaluate diagnostic performance of any significant parameter for discriminating clinically significant cancer (CSC, GS >= 7) from non-CSC. Methods A total of 116 patients who had been confirmed as prostate adenocarcinoma by radical prostatectomy or biopsy were divided into a training (n = 65) and a validation dataset (n = 51). All of the patients underwent preoperative 3T-MRI. Texture analysis was performed on axial T2WI and ADC maps (generated from b values, 0 and 1000 s/mm(2)) using dedicated software to cover the whole tumor volume. The correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate the association between texture parameters and GS, and subsequent multiple regression analyses were applied for the significant parameters. To extract an optimal cut-off value for prediction of CSC, ROC curve analysis was performed. Results In the training dataset, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) entropy on ADC map was the only significant indicator for GS (coefficient of determinationR(2), 0.4227,P = 0.0034). The AUC of GLCM entropy on ADC map was 0.825 (95% CI 0.711-0.907) with a maximum accuracy of 82%, a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 71%. When a cut-off value of 2.92 was applied to the validation dataset, it showed an accuracy of 92%, a sensitivity of 98%, and a specificity of 70%. Conclusion GLCM entropy on ADC map was associated with GS in patients with PCa and its estimated accuracy for discriminating CSC from non-CSC was 82%.",Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Texture analysis; Prostate cancer; Gleason score; Prostate gland,"Baek, TW; Kim, SH; Park, SJ; Park, EJ",2020.0,JournalEA,ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00261-020-02683-4,"[Baek, Tae Wook; Kim, Seung Ho; Park, Eun Joo] Inje Univ, Coll Med, Haeundae Paik Hosp, Dept Radiol, Haeundae Ro 875, Busan 48108, South Korea; [Park, Sang Joon] Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Dept Radiol, Daehak Ro 101, Seoul 03080, South Korea",SPRINGER,English,2366-004X,

WoS,Acupuncture and related techniques for obesity and cardiovascular risk factors: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis,"Objective: To assess how acupuncture and related techniques affect weight-related indicators and cardiovascular risk factors compared with non-acupuncture interventions in overweight and obese patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL up to 19 April 2018 and included relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using the inverse variance method with random-effects model. Prespecified hypotheses were tested in meta-regression to investigate the source of heterogeneity. Statistical software packages used were RevMan 5.3.5 and Stata 14.0. Results: Thirty-three RCTs were included (n=2503 patients). Compared with non-acupuncture interventions, acupuncture produced a greater reduction in body weight (WMD -1.76 kg, 95% CI -2.22 to -1.30, I-2=77%; moderate quality), body mass index (WMD -1.13 kg/m(2), 95% CI -1.38 to -0.88, I-2=85%; low quality) and waist circumference (WMD -2.42 cm, 95% CI -3.22 to -1.62, I-2=75%; moderate quality). Acupuncture plus lifestyle intervention resulted in a greater reduction in body weight than acupuncture alone (MD -1.94 kg, 95% CI -3.17 to -0.70). Acupuncture also led to a greater reduction in total cholesterol (WMD -12.87 mg/dL, 95% CI -22.17 to -3.57, I-2=87%; very low quality) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD -13.52 mg/dL, 95% CI -21.47 to -5.58, I-2=74%; low quality). The differences were not statistically significant for blood glucose or blood pressure. Conclusion: In the short term, acupuncture and related techniques may produce a small but statistically significant degree of weight loss based on moderate- to low-quality evidence, and improve serum lipid parameters based on low- to very-low-quality evidence.

WoS,Phospholipidomics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs): the tricky case of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their healthy siblings,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a broad and heterogeneous group of neurological developmental disorders characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, restricted and repetitive behavioural patterns, and altered sensory processing. Currently, no reliable ASD molecular biomarkers are available. Since immune dysregulation has been supposed to be related with ASD onset and dyslipidaemia has been recognized as an early symptom of biological perturbation, lipid extracts from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), consisting primarily of lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, and NK cells) and monocytes, of 38 children with ASD and their non-autistic siblings were investigated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with electrospray ionization and Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (ESI-FTMS). Performances of two freeware software for data extraction and processing were compared with acquired reliable data regardless of the used informatics. A reduction of variables from 1460 by the untargeted XCMS to 324 by the semi-untargeted Alex(123) software was attained. All-ion fragmentation (AIF) MS scans along with Alex(12) (3)software were successfully applied to obtain information related to fatty acyl chain composition of six glycerophospholipid classes occurring in PBMC. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were explored to verify the occurrence of significant differences in the lipid pool composition of ASD children compared with 36 healthy siblings. After rigorous statistical validation, we conclude that phospholipids extracted from PBMC of children affected by ASD do not exhibit diagnostic biomarkers.

WoS,A novel RK4-Hopfield Neural Network for Power Flow Analysis of power system,"This paper presents a novel Runge-Kutta (RK4) based modified hopfield neural network (MHNN) for solving a set of non-linear transcendental power flow equations of power system. The proffered method is a Lyapunov based energy function approach to minimize real and reactive power mismatches of the system. A set of non-linear differential equations derived from energy function, describing the dynamical behavior of HNN is framed for solving Power Flow equations. These dynamic equations of the network are solved by RK4 method to deduce the unknown variables of the system. The feasibility of proposed method is tested on 5-bus, IEEE 14-bus, 39-bus and 57-bus test system. The analytical equation describing the behavior of MHNN is coded in MATLAB software. The results obtained reveal that the suggested method gives accurate solution and reduces the computational complexity than conventional Newton Raphson (NR) method. The sensitivity analysis is also tested for change in R/X ratio of the system, initial conditions and loading of the system. The proposed method is robust for above specified changes and involves less computational effort. To prove the applicability and consistency of projected method, IEEE 118-bus system has been tested. The power flow solutions found through proffered method are compared with solutions obtained from numerical approaches in order to validate the proposed approach. Moreover, the stability of the system is studied in Lyapunov sense of notion which assures converged solution of proposed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty five runs were designed to investigate the effect of V. amygdalina leaf extract ratio (A), initial potassium permanganate (KMnO4) concentration (B), pH (C), and reaction time (D) on the biosynthesized MnO2 NPs using 4-factor, 4-level D-Optimal Response Surface Quadratic Design Model approach. The relationship between physicochemical variables and absorption responses were established using transform second degree polynomial quadratic model. The effects of each absorption responses were analyzed by ANOVA principle using quadratic equations. A very low p-values (<0.0001), non-significant Lack of Fit F-values, and reasonable regression coefficient values (coefficient R-2 = 0.9790, adjusted R-2 = 0.9496, and predicted R-2 = 0.8452) suggested that there is an effective correlation between experimental results and predicted values. Numerical and graphical optimized results demonstrated that the optimized conditions for the predicted absorbance at 320 nm (1.095) were suggested at 43.72%, 1.81 mM, 6.02, and 103.42 min for V. amygdalina leaf extract ratio, initial KMnO4 concentration, pH, and reaction time, respectively.

TCMTB underwent rapid degradation by direct photolysis with a high-pressure mercury lamp in aqueous solutions, with 99% removal after 30 min at all concentrations studied. For sunlight photolysis, TCMTB degradation was observed with 96%, 81%, and 64% removal for initial concentrations of 6.0, 30.0, and 60.0 mg L- 1, respectively, after 7 h of exposure to sunlight. The degradation of TCMTB in lab-scale wastewater had kinetic constant and t(1/2)in the same order when compared to the photodegradation of TCMTB in aqueous solutions. In addition, the results showed that photolysis with a high-pressure mercury lamp and sunlight were governed by the same kinetic order, however the kinetic parameters showed that degradation with sunlight was 40 times slower than photolysis with the mercury lamp. Twelve transformation products (TP) were identified, and eight of the TP have not been described in the literature. Furthermore, prediction of toxicity with ECOSAR software was carried out for fish, daphnids, and green algae species. It showed that photolytic treatment is efficient for reducing the toxicity of the compound, since the degradation formed compounds with lower toxicity than the primary compound.

WoS,Evaluating the usage of predefined interactive behaviors for writing user stories: an empirical study with potential product owners,"Behavior-driven development (BDD) has gained popularity in agile software development as a means of specifying user requirements through user stories and scenarios for interactive systems under construction. Templates for guiding the writing of such stories are widely employed and can be helpful to ensure that consistent information about the requirements is provided. With the aim of getting preliminary results about how product owners (POs) write their own user stories under a predefined template, we conducted a case study with potential POs at the department in charge of business trips in a French research institute. The participants were invited to write their own user stories to describe a feature they are used to perform. The resultant stories have been analyzed to check their adherence to a template including common interactive behaviors defined by an ontology for interactive systems. Although the participants have followed different specification strategies, we observed an overall high level of adherence to the proposed template (62.26%). The results also pointed out to a wide use of domain-dependent behaviors, with the interactive behaviors defined by the ontology being, to some extent, reproduced by the participants even without prior training in the adopted vocabulary.",Behavior-driven development (BDD); User stories; Agile software development; User requirements,"Silva, TR; Winckler, M; Bach, C",2020.0,Journal,COGNITION TECHNOLOGY & WORK,10.1007/s10111-019-00566-3,"[Rocha Silva, Thiago; Winckler, Marco] Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, ICS IRIT, Toulouse, France; [Rocha Silva, Thiago] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Comp Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [Winckler, Marco] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis Polytech, SPARKS I3S, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Bach, Cedric] HDG, Human Design Grp, Toulouse, France",SPRINGER LONDON LTD,English,1435-5558,

Voltage variations (faults) in the actuators are detected and isolated by means of residual-based equations and exploiting the third-order sliding mode differentiator (SMD). Proposed fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme is tested with intermittent and persistent faults induced by software. A unknown-input sliding mode observer (SMO) is developed to compare and highlight the performance of the proposed FDI-SMD respect to the classic FDI-SMO. Finally, simulations and real-time experiments confirm that CTA-based controllers counteract additive faults.

In order to provide more accurate results, we performed this meta-analysis. Methods We searched PubMed, and Wanfang Med Online in both English and Chinese, and eight eligible studies comprising of 5345 cases and 9523 controls were eventually selected into our meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 software. Results In pooled analysis, theFTO geners9939609 polymorphism significantly increased MS susceptibility under per-allele comparisons (A vs. T) (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.35,P < 0.001) and in dominant model (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.62,P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses under per-allele comparisons (A vs. T) indicated that the elevated risk was observed in adults (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.47,P = 0.003) but not in children and adolescents (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95-1.36,P = 0.17), and that the risk for increasing MS was only identified in IDF groups (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.43,P = 0.018) but not in NCEP ATP III groups (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95-1.36,P = 0.17); in both population-based (PB) and hospital-based (HB) groups, A alleles of rs9939609 appeared to be linked to increased MS susceptibilities (HB group: OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10-2.08,P = 0.01; PB group: OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09-1.30,P < 0.001).

WoS,Depiction of ethnic facial aging by forensic artists and preliminary assessment of the applicability of facial averages,"Many characteristics of facial aging are common to all. The age of their onset and which characteristics tend to predominate varies among individuals depending on many factors including their genetic makeup, life experiences, environment in which they live, and the regional, ethnic, or socially perceived group to which they belong. Forensic artists are often asked to provide sketches, 2D or 3D digital renderings, or sculptures representative of how an individual may appear at an older age based on a provided photograph, victim or witness description, and/or cranial remains. The challenge escalates when the subject is a member of a regional, ethnic, or other socially perceived group to which the artist has had little or no exposure. We describe aspects of adult facial aging that are of particular relevance to the forensic artist, applicable software tools, and pertinent facial databases, especially those emphasizing non-white populations. We demonstrate that facial averaging offers two key advantages to the artistic portrayal of facial aging: first, the technique requires relatively small reference databases from groups that may present logistical challenges to collect and second, that a facial average provides a useful representation of the gestalt of the age and ethnicity cohort to which a subject belongs. The artist may use an average along with other available information such as photo reference books, eyewitness descriptions, photos of immediate family members, and cranial structure to guide production of a facial composite drawing, digital age progression, or sculpture of the subject in question.

WoS,Guideline: Auditory processing and perception disorders: Proposal for treatment and management of APD S1 guideline of the German Society of Phoniatrics and Pediatric Audiology,"Despite normal hearing thresholds in pure-tone audiometry, 0.5-1% of children have difficulty understanding what they hear. An auditory processing disorder (APD) can be assumed, which should be clarified and treated. In patients with hearing loss, this must first be compensated or resolved. Only hereafter can a suspected APD be confirmed or excluded. Diagnosis of APD requires that a clear discrepancy between the child's performance in individual auditory functions and other cognitive abilities be demonstrated. Combination of therapeutical modalities is considered particularly more beneficial in APD patients than a single modality. Treatment modalities should consider linguistic and cognitive processes (top-down), e.g., metacognitive knowledge of learning strategies or vocabulary expansion, but also address underlying auditory deficits (bottom-up). Almost 50% of children with APD also have a language development disorder requiring treatment and/or dyslexia. Therefore, each therapeutic intervention for a child with APD must be individually adapted according to the diagnosed impairments. Musical training can improve phonologic and reading abilities. Changes and adaptations in the classroom are helpful to support the weak auditory system of children with APD. Architectural planning of classrooms can be a means of ensuring that direct sound is masked by as little diffuse sound as possible. For example, acoustic ceiling tiles are suitable for reducing reverberant and diffuse sound.",Learning disability; Working memory; Speech-language intervention; Hearing aid; FM-System,"Sch?nweiler, R; Kiese-Himmel, C; Plotz, K; Nickisch, A; Zehnhoff-Dinnesen, AA",2020.0,Journal,HNO,10.1007/s00106-020-00825-0,"[Schoenweiler, R.] Univ Lubeck, Sekt Phoniatrie & Padaudiol, Univ Klinikum Schleswig Holstein, Campus Lubeck,Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23562 Lubeck, Germany; [Kiese-Himmel, C.] Georg August Univ, Univ Med Gottingen, Inst Med Psychol & Med Soziol, Schwerpunkt Phoniatr Padaudiol Psychol, Gottingen, Germany; [Plotz, K.] Jade Hsch Oldenburg, Inst Hortech & Audiol IHA, Oldenburg, Germany; [Nickisch, A.] Kbo Kinderzentrum Munchen gGmbH, Abt Horen Sprache Cochlea Implantate, Munich, Germany; [Am Zehnhoff-Dinnesen, A.] Univ Klinikum Munster, Klin Phoniatrie & Padaudiol, Munster, Germany",SPRINGER,German,0017-6192,
WoS,Real-Time Light Field Denoising Using a Novel Linear 4-D Hyperfan Filter,"Four-dimensional (4-D) light fields (LFs) enable novel imaging technologies, which are traditionally based on two-dimensional images. In most of these applications, denoising of LFs is required as a preprocessing technique before any subsequent processing. We propose a real-time LF denoising method using a novel 4-D linear and shift-invariant hyperfan filter. The proposed method exploits sparsity of the spectrum of a LF and the 4-D hyperfan filter is implemented in the 4-D mixed-domain (i.e.,two-dimensional space and two-dimensional frequency) leading to significant reductions in computational and memory complexities. A software implementation of the proposed method provides better or comparable denoising performance for grayscale and color LFs with respect to the metrics peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) compared to previously reported linear LF denoising methods, while reducing the processing time approximately by 66% and 31% for grayscale and color LFs, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a semi-systolic hardware architecture for the proposed denoising method, and implement on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA implementation implies a throughput of 25 LFs/s for LFs of size 11x11x625x434 and provides approximately 13 dB improvement in PSNR and 0.7 improvement in SSIM for grayscale LFs verifying the suitability for real-time processing.",Light fields; denoising; real-time implementation; sparsity; FPGAs; imaging; camera arrays,"Premaratne, SU; Liyanage, N; Edussooriya, CUS; Wijenayake, C",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS,10.1109/TCSI.2020.2981387,"[Premaratne, Sanduni U.; Edussooriya, Chamira U.

The OPF employs the vortex search algorithm (VSA) in conjunction with a power flow method based on successive approximations by proposing a master-slave optimization methodology. The VSA is a powerful numerical optimization method that works with Gaussian distributions and variable radius for intensive exploration and exploitation in the solution space of the OPF problem. The power flow based on successive approximations allows evaluating the objective function by solving the non-convex equality constraints related to the power balance equations.

WoS,Hardware-Efficient 2D-DCT/IDCT Architecture for Portable HEVC-Compliant Devices,"Low power hardware acceleration cores for integration into real-time High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) codec for smartphones, tablets, camcorders, and televisions are in great demand. This need motivates one for an efficient realization of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Inverse-DCT (IDCT) for HEVC. This paper presents an algorithm to calculate the required minimum number of low-frequency DCT-output/IDCT-input coefficients for 4, 8, 16, and 32-point DCT/IDCT in HEVC, such that there is a slight decrease in peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (<0.15 decibel) and a minor increment in bitrate (<1.5%) as compared to the reference HEVC-Test-Model (HM) Software. However, the encoding time gets reduced at most by 17.95% for Class-A type sequences, while reporting mean-squared-error and structural-similarity of 1.42 and 0.9913, respectively for 4K ultra-high-definition videos. Moreover, HEVC-compliant computationally efficient architectures are introduced for n-point DCT/IDCT. The presented flexible Transpose Memory architecture uses only sixteen random-access-memories to support all transform-unit sizes in HEVC. The proposed two-dimensional DCT/IDCT architecture can process up to 288@4K frames-per-second, and it consumes the minimum power, energy, and area of 11.23 milliwatts, 2.34 picojoules, and 120 kilo-gate-equivalents, respectively.

WoS,A Weakly-Supervised Framework for COVID-19 Classification and Lesion Localization From Chest CT,"Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning framework was developed using 3D CT volumes for COVID-19 classification and lesion localization. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious; the COVID-19 lesions are localized by combining the activation regions in the classification network and the unsupervised connected components. 499 CT volumes were used for training and 131 CT volumes were used for testing. Our algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability and discover lesion regions in chest CT without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

The presented codes are constructed with the help of a computer and have three desirable properties. First, they use integer and lookup table operations, which make them suitable for software implementation. Second, depending on the application requirements, the proposed codes can be used as low-rate error correction (EC) codes or as high-rate error detection (ED) codes. In the EC mode, which is suited for real-time applications, the receiver can correct all single and double errors, as well as all triple-adjacent (TA) errors within one b-bit byte. On the other hand, if the integrity of data is of high importance, the receiver may operate in the ED mode. In that case, it is able to detect all quadruple errors, all double TA errors within one b-bit byte, and all double TA errors within two b-bit bytes. Finally, it is important to note that the presented codes can be interleaved without delay and without using any additional hardware.

Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) is an essential part of every network to perform packet classification and forwarding, but they are missing in modern FPGAs. Researchers and FPGA vendors have proposed several designs to emulate TCAM using available memories on FPGA, but they are power inefficient due to the activating of entire circuitry in a single search operation. In this brief, we propose a novel power-aware reconfigurable FPGA-based TCAM architecture that enables only a portion of the hardware to perform the search operation. We performed an extensive design space exploration to find the optimal number of banks on Xilinx FPGAs, which provides the maximum power saving. Moreover, we propose a solution to bank overflow using backup CAM (BUC) to handle the overflowed CAM entries.

The purpose of this study was to examine the posterolateral joint visibility, using lateral extended approaches, such as the lateral femoral epicondyle osteotomy or the fibula osteotomy. Further, the study aimed to compare the combined osteotomy of the femoral footprints of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and popliteus tendon (PLT) to the isolated osteotomy of the femoral LCL footprint or the fibula osteotomy, in terms of posterolateral joint accessibility. Methods: Extended lateral (femoral or fibular LCL osteotomy) and posterolateral (additional femoral osteotomy of the PLT tendon) approaches were performed on twelve human cadaver knees. After preparation of each surgical approach, the visible articular surface was marked with diathermy. The tibial plateau was disarticulated and the markings were measured digitally with open-source processing software. Differences in mean values were tested with a paired t-test (p <= 0.05). Results: The greatest articular exposure was achieved with the fibula osteotomy (1011.52 +/- 227.05 mm(2) [86.64 +/- 4.84%] compared to the combined osteotomy of LCL and PLT (p = 0.036) or LCL alone (p<0.001). The lateral femoral epicondyle osteotomy of the LCL including the PLT (937.45 +/- 237.84 mm(2) [80.29 +/- 8.25%]) exposed a significantly larger articular surface of the lateral tibial plateau than without the PLT (755.71 +/- 183.06 mm(2) [64.73 +/- 6.51%], p < 0.001). Conclusion: In direct comparison, the fibula osteotomy provides the largest articular visualization, however at cost of a considerably larger soft tissue damage. While the lateral femoral epicondyle osteotomy of LCL and PLT increases lateral articular visualization, it omits the risk of neurovascular or posterolateral soft tissue damage and therefore represents an important extended approach to treat comminuted lateral plateau fractures.

WoS,Understanding the Challenges of Induction of Lactation and Relactation for Non-Gestating Spanish Mothers,"Background Induced lactation and relactation are the processes that enable breastfeeding in non-gestating mothers. Research aim The aim of this study was to describe and interpret the challenges faced by mothers who undergo induced breastfeeding and relactation for adopted infants, infants born via surrogacy, and infants born to same-sex female partners. Methods A qualitative study was performed using in-depth interviews conducted with Spanish women (N= 9) who had decided to undergo induced lactation or relactation. The data were collected between October 2014 and May 2017. The length of the study was due to the difficulty in locating and recruiting the sample. Interviews were transcribed and coded with the ATLAS.ti v.7.5.7 software. We performed a deductive thematic analysis, creating categories based on the interview questions, which we developed on the basis of previous literature about induced lactation and relactation. Results Participants described the following challenges: the physical hardships of the process; breastfeeding problems; difficulty with accessing information about induced lactation or relactation; and lack of support from health professionals. Breastfeeding periods lasted from 1.5 months to 4 years. Participants reported that breastfeeding increased the closeness between the mother and child and that this feeling of closeness tended to decrease after breastfeeding cessation. Conclusion We offer data and analysis that can improve our understanding of the lived experiences of women undergoing the process of relactation or induced lactation and may help guide intervention strategies to support women in this situation.",breastfeeding; induced lactation; qualitative methods; relactation,"Cazorla-Ortiz, G; Galbany-Estragu?s, P; Obreg?n-Guti?rrez, N; Goberna-Tricas, J",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF HUMAN LACTATION,10.1177/0890334419852939,"[Cazorla-Ortiz, Gemma; Obregon-Gutierrez, Noemi] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth Mental Hlth & Perinatal Nursing, Barcelona, Spain; [Cazorla-Ortiz, Gemma; Obregon-Gutierrez, Noemi] Hosp Univ Parc Tauli, Barcelona, Spain; [Galbany-Estragues, Paola] Cent Univ Catalonia UVic UCC, Univ Vic, Fac Hlth Sci & Welf, Res Grp Methodol Models Methods & Outcomes Hlth &, Vic, Spain; [Galbany-Estragues, Paola] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, AFIN, Social & Cultural Dept, Bellaterra, Spain; [Goberna-Tricas, Josefina] Univ Barcelona, ADHUC Res Ctr Theory Gender & Sexual, Fac Med & Hlth Serv, Dept Publ Hlth Mental Hlth & Perinatal Nursing, Barcelona, Spain",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,English,0890-3344,
WoS,Kinetics and thermodynamics of synthesis of palm oil-based trimethylolpropane triester using microwave irradiation,"Enhancement of reaction performance utilizing microwave irradiation has drawn so much interest due to its shorter reaction time and low catalyst loading. These advantages are particularly significant from kinetics and thermodynamics perspectives. This study aimed to investigate the kinetics and thermodynamics of microwave-assisted transesterification of palm oil-based methyl ester into biolubricant. The transesterification reaction of palm oil methyl ester (PME) and trimethylolpropane (TMP) was conducted at 110-130 degrees C for 90 min under vacuum condition. Sodium methoxide was employed as the catalyst at 0.6 wt% of reactants fixed at molar ratio of 4:1 (PME: TMP). The experimental data were fitted with the second-order reversible reaction kinetics mechanisms. The data were solved via Runge-Kutta 4,5 order using MATLAB software. Analysis on the data revealed that the reaction rate constants at temperatures of 110-140 degrees C were in the range of 0.01-0.63 [(w/w)(min)](-1), with standard errors of 0.0026-0.0228 within 99.99% prediction interval. Microwave-assisted reaction obtained 17.0 kcal/mol of activation energy. This method reduced activation energy by 49% as compared to the conventional heating. Activation energy and time-periodic energy assessment showed that the reaction was endothermic. The reaction at 130 degrees C is the easiest to activate. The positive Gibbs free energy (Delta G > 0) found using Eyring-Polanyi equation indicated that the transesterification was non-spontaneous and endergonic. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

WoS,Effects of the Serber first step in 3DHZETRN-v2.1,"3DHZETRN-v2 includes a detailed three dimensional (3D) treatment of neutron/light-ion transport based on a quasi-elastic/multiple production assumption allowing improved agreement of the neutron/light-ion fluence compared with results of three Monte Carlo (MC) codes in the sense that the variance with respect to the individual MC results is less than the variance among the MC code results. The current numerical methods are no longer the main limitation to HZETRN code development and further changes in the nuclear model are required. In a prior study, an improved quasi-elastic spectrum based on a solution of the transport approximation to nuclear media effects showed promise, but the remaining multiple-production spectrum was based on a database derived from the Ranft model that used Bertini multiplicities. In the present paper, we will implement a more complete Serber first step into the 3DHZETRN-v2 code, but we retain the Bertini-Ranft branching ratios and evaporation multiplicities. It is shown that the new Serber model in the 3HZETRN-v2 code reduces the variance with individual MC codes, which are largely due to nuclear cross section model differences. The code will be available through the software system, OLTARIS, for shield design and validation and provides a basis for personal computer software capable of space shield analysis and optimization.",Serber nuclear model; Fragmentation cross section; Spectral distribution,"Wilson, JW; Werneth, CM; Slaba, TC; Badavi, FF; Reddell, BD; Bahadori, AA",2020.0,Journal,LIFE SCIENCES IN SPACE RESEARCH,10.1016/j.lssr.2020.03.004,"[Wilson, J.

WoS,Evaluation of significant gene expression changes in congenital and acquired cholesteatoma,"Etiopathogenesis of acquired and congenital cholesteatoma is still unclear. The clinical behavior of adult acquired, pediatric acquired and congenital cholesteatomas show differences. The scope of the this study was to detect thematrix metalloproteinase(MMP),tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase(TIMP) andepidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) gene expression changes in cholesteatoma perimatrix and to compare these changes among congenital cholesteatoma, adult acquired cholesteatoma and pediatric acquired cholesteatoma. A total of 16 genes includingMMPs,TIMPs andEGFRwere analyzed in the samples of 32 cholesteatoma tissues. Real-time PCR was used for detection of the gene expression levels. Data analyses were achieved by Delta Delta CT method (Light Cycler 480 Quantification Software) and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. The expression levels ofMMP-2,-9,-10,-11,-13,-14,-15,-16andEGFRgenes were significantly higher in acquired cholesteatoma than healthy tissue (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant decrease (3.34 times more) in the meanTIMP-2gene expression level in acquired cholesteatoma compared to healthy tissue (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the mean expression level ofMMP-7gene and a decrease in the mean expression level ofTIMP-1gene (3.12 times more) in congenital cholesteatoma compared to healthy tissue (p < 0.05). This study indicates that increased expression levels of some particularMMPgenes andEGFRgene and decreased expression levels ofTIMPgenes may play an important role in the development of cholesteatoma. Further,MMP-9,MMP-13andMMP-14genes may have a remarkable role in the development of more aggressive cholesteatoma forms. The authors concluded that overexpression ofMMP-9,MMP-13andMMP-14may cause stronger inflammation associated with cholesteatoma.",Cholesteatoma; Matrix metalloproteinase; Cholesteatoma genetics; Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; Epidermal growth factor receptor,"Kaya, I; Avci, CB; Sahin, FF; Ozates, NP; Sezgin, B; Kurt, CC; Bilgen, C; Kirazli, T",2020.0,JournalEA,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS,10.1007/s11033-020-05689-9,"[Kaya, Isa; Sahin, Fetih Furkan; Sezgin, Baha; Bilgen, Cem; Kirazli, Tayfun] Ege Univ, Sch Med, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Izmir, Turkey; [Avci, Cigir Biray; Ozates, Neslihan Pinar; Kurt, Cansu Caliskan] Ege Univ, Dept Med Biol, Sch Med, Izmir, Turkey",SPRINGER,English,0301-4851,
WoS,Assessment of Systems and Services for Management of Diabetes and Diabetic Retinopathy in Cameroon,"Aim To evaluate systems and services for management of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy. Methodology The National Program for Blindness Control conducted a nationwide descriptive study from 1(st)February to 31(st)October 2016. Data was collected using WHO's:Tool Assessment of Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetes Management Systems adapted to the context. Using direct interviews, all previously identified stakeholders, were involved from all levels of management and throughout the territory. The IBM version 20 software permitted analysis. Results Out of the 48 individuals selected, 46 agreed to participate in the survey. Four participants (8.7%) worked at the central level of the Ministry of Public Health, 2 (4.4%) were NGOs partners, 6 (13%) diabetic patients, and 34 (73.9%) health staff. According to the answers of participants, diabetes stands among priorities in the national health policy. Diabetic care services have been integrated into the National action plan for Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases, but a specific program for control of diabetes has not been created neither are national guidelines recommended by the Ministry available. Some health facilities provide care for diabetes and its complications. Modern technologies for evaluation and follow-up of diabetes of its complications are available only in tertiary level hospitals and in some private clinics. The cost of care obtained is the responsibility of the patients and families.

WoS,Imbalance-XGBoost: leveraging weighted and focal losses for binary label-imbalanced classification with XGBoost,"The paper presents Imbalance-XGBoost, a Python package that combines the powerful XGBoost software with weighted and focal losses to tackle binary label-imbalanced classification tasks. Though a small-scale program in terms of size, the package is, to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind which provides an integrated implementation for the two loss functions on XGBoost and brings a general-purpose extension to XGBoost for label-imbalanced scenarios. In this paper, the design and usage of the package are discussed and illustrated with examples. Furthermore, as the first- and second-order derivatives of the loss functions are essential for the implementations, the algebraic derivation is discussed and it can be deemed as a separate contribution. The performances of the methods implemented in the package are extensively evaluated on Parkinson's disease classification dataset, and multiple competitive performances are presented with the ROC and Precision-Recall (PR) curves. To further assert the superiority of the methods, the performances on four other benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository are additionally reported. Given the scalable nature of XGBoost, the package has great potentials to be broadly applied to real-life binary classification tasks, which are usually of large-scale and label-imbalanced.

WoS,Security improvement in block chain technique enabled peer to peer network for beyond 5G and internet of things,"Secured data transmission and data sharing have always been a challenge on the Internet of things-based networks. Blockchain-enabled peer to peer (P2P) networks are suitable infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Beyond 5G (B5G) applications. The advantage is that the distributed nature of architecture and security services provided by this network extends its use in all sort of financial transactions. There are many issues related to IoT based networks; Heterogeneous IoT devices, security, energy issues. This paper implements data security by employing private blockchain in SDN and public blockchain for peer to peer communication and a secured authentication method to validate the blocks in the network. To increase confidentiality and non-repudiation, it implements an additional component; here, the sender signs the particular operation while transferring the data from one user to another user. It is published with a public key and Public-key value-based signature generated with the private key of the transaction. Nodes authenticate this operation based on Public key value-based signature thus generated. The cryptography with hashing process provides better immutability.

WoS,Reasons to overthrow TURP: bring on Aquablation,"Purpose In this review, we will discuss the state of the literature regarding Aquablation, its limitations, and opportunities for its application in the treatment of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). Methods A comprehensive review of original research on Aquablation was conducted. Articles related to transurethral resection of the prostate, holmium laser enucleation of the prostate, greenlight photoselective vaporization of the prostate, and simple prostatectomy were reviewed for discussion. Results For small-medium prostates (30-80 mL), Aquablation's main advantages include better ejaculatory function and similar functional outcomes compared to TURP. For large prostates (80-150 mL), Aquablation demonstrates shorter operative time and superior ejaculatory function when compared to simple prostatectomy, HoLEP, and Greenlight PVP. In addition, Aquablation displays shorter hospital stays than simple prostatectomy. The integration of software programming and semi-automatic technology increases the reproducibility of the procedure and helps standardize overall outcomes, while also accelerating the learning curve. Its ability to preserve antegrade ejaculation makes Aquablation a very compelling option for sexually active patients. However cost and postoperative bleeding risks remain a concern. Conclusion The current evidence suggests that Aquablation is a safe and effective alternative for BPE for small to large prostates.

Numerical simulations of the proposed novel model are conducted, accompanied by Cattaneo-Christov heat flux in a Darcy-Forchheimer permeable media. Additional impacts of homogeneous-heterogeneous reactions are also noted, including melting heat. A relevant transformation procedure is implemented for the transition of partial differential equations to the ordinary variety. A computer software-based MATLAB function, bvp4c, is implemented to handle the envisioned mathematical model. Sketches portraying impacts on radial velocity, temperature, and concentration of the included parameters are given, and deliberated upon. Skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number are evaluated via graphical illustrations. It is observed that the local inertia coefficient has an opposite impact on radial velocity and temperature field.

WoS,The impact of automated feature selection techniques on the interpretation of defect models,"The interpretation of defect models heavily relies on software metrics that are used to construct them. Prior work often uses feature selection techniques to remove metrics that are correlated and irrelevant in order to improve model performance. Yet, conclusions that are derived from defect models may be inconsistent if the selected metrics are inconsistent and correlated. In this paper, we systematically investigate 12 automated feature selection techniques with respect to the consistency, correlation, performance, computational cost, and the impact on the interpretation dimensions. Through an empirical investigation of 14 publicly-available defect datasets, we find that (1) 94-100% of the selected metrics are inconsistent among the studied techniques; (2) 37-90% of the selected metrics are inconsistent among training samples; (3) 0-68% of the selected metrics are inconsistent when the feature selection techniques are applied repeatedly; (4) 5-100% of the produced subsets of metrics contain highly correlated metrics; and (5) while the most important metrics are inconsistent among correlation threshold values, such inconsistent most important metrics are highly-correlated with the Spearman correlation of 0.85-1. Since we find that the subsets of metrics produced by the commonly-used feature selection techniques (except for AutoSpearman) are often inconsistent and correlated, these techniques should be avoided when interpreting defect models. In addition to introducing AutoSpearman which mitigates correlated metrics better than commonly-used feature selection techniques, this paper opens up new research avenues in the automated selection of features for defect models to optimise for interpretability as well as performance.",Software analytics; Defect prediction; Model interpretation; Feature selection,"Jiarpakdee, J; Tantithamthavorn, C; Treude, C",2020.0,JournalEA,EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,10.1007/s10664-020-09848-1,"[Jiarpakdee, Jirayus; Tantithamthavorn, Chakkrit] Monash Univ, Fac Informat & Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Treude, Christoph] Univ Adelaide, Sch Comp Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia",SPRINGER,English,1382-3256,

The charging capacitor is charged to the desired voltage by a high-voltage DC power source. After the charging process, the test cable sample is charged by the capacitor. The resonant circuit is formed by the charging capacitor, the test cable, and the resonant reactor to create an oscillating decay voltage. With this novel method, no space charge is injected into the cable insulation. The effect of the charging capacitance on the charging efficiency is calculated with the Multisim software.

The method accounts for normal bus-switching sequences, in-service transfer, bypassed current transformers, breaker substitution, and paralleled buses. One of the main benefits is that neither logic equations nor switching analysis are required as inputs when using this method.

WoS,Travel health risk perceptions of Chinese international students in Australia - Implications for COVID-19,"Background: International students frequently return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFR), and are at increased risk of travel-associated infections. Little is known of their travel health seeking behaviours. China is the biggest source of international students studying in Australia and the unprecedented epidemic of COVID-19 in China makes this an important area of research. Methods: Focus groups of Chinese international students were conducted to explore travel health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. Eligible participants were studying in Sydney, and had travelled to China and Hong Kong to visit friends and relatives in the preceding 18 months. A variety of topics were explored, using a focus group guide. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcripts using nVivo software. The list of codes and themes were not predetermined but developed through content analysis. Results: Two focus groups were held with a total of 28 participants. Risk perception about VFR travel was generally low among Chinese international students. Pre-travel healthcare was not sought. Students strongly relied on the Internet, social media, parents and friends in China for travel health advice. Conclusion: This research provides insights into Chinese international students as VFR travellers. It confirms students could be a risk population for importations of infections such as COVID-19 because of low risk perception and lack of seeking travel health advice. This can inform health promotion strategies for students. (C) 2020 Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control. Published by Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Sensitivity of Neuromechanical Predictions to Choice of Glenohumeral Stability Modeling Approach,"Most upper-extremity musculoskeletal models represent the glenohumeral joint with an inherently stable ball-and-socket, but the physiological joint requires active muscle coordination for stability. The authors evaluated sensitivity of common predicted outcomes (instability, net glenohumeral reaction force, and rotator cuff activations) to different implementations of active stabilizing mechanisms (constraining net joint reaction direction and incorporating normalized surface electromyography [EMG]). Both EMG and reaction force constraints successfully reduced joint instability. For flexion, incorporating any normalized surface EMG data reduced predicted instability by 54.8%, whereas incorporating any force constraint reduced predicted instability by 43.1%. Other outcomes were sensitive to EMG constraints, but not to force constraints. For flexion, incorporating normalized surface EMG data increased predicted magnitudes of joint reaction force and rotator cuff activations by 28.7% and 88.4%, respectively. Force constraints had no influence on these predicted outcomes for all tasks evaluated. More restrictive EMG constraints also tended to overconstrain the model, making it challenging to accurately track input kinematics. Therefore, force constraints may be a more robust choice when representing stability.",EMG; shoulder; computational modeling; joint reaction; simulation,"McFarland, DC; Brynildsen, AG; Saul, KR",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMECHANICS,10.1123/jab.2019-0088,"[McFarland, Daniel C.; Brynildsen, Alexander G.; Saul, Katherine R.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",HUMAN KINETICS PUBL INC,English,1065-8483,
WoS,An Automated Kinematic Measurement System for Sagittal Plane Murine Head Impacts,"Mild traumatic brain injuries are typically caused by nonpenetrating head impacts that accelerate the skull and result in deformation of the brain within the skull. The shear and compressive strains caused by these deformations damage neural and vascular structures and impair their function. Accurate head acceleration measurements are necessary to define the nature of the insult to the brain. A novel murine head tracking system was developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of kinematic measurements obtained with high-speed videography. A three-dimensional (3D)-printed marker carrier was designed for rigid fixation to the upper jaw and incisors with an elastic strap around the snout. The system was evaluated by impacting cadaveric mice with the closed head impact model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) system using an energy of 0.7 J (5.29 m/s). We compared the performance of the head-marker system to the previously used skin-tracking method and documented significant improvements in measurement repeatability (aggregate coefficient of variation (CV) within raters from 15.8 to 1.5 and between raters from 15.5 to 1.5), agreement (aggregate percentage error from 24.9 to 8.7), and temporal response (aggregate temporal curve agreement from 0.668 to 0.941). Additionally, the new system allows for automated software tracking, which dramatically decreases the analysis time required (74% reduction). This novel head tracking system for mice offers an efficient, reliable, and real-time method to measure head kinematics during high-speed impacts using CHIMERA or other rodent or small mammal head impact models.",head kinematics; traumatic brain injury (TBI); closed head impact model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA); biomechanics,"McInnes, KA; Abebe, ZA; Whyte, T; Bashir, A; Barron, C; Wellington, CL; Cripton, PA",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME,10.1115/1.4046202,"[McInnes, Kurt A.; Abebe, Zelalem A.; Whyte, Thomas; Cripton, Peter A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Mech Engn, 2054-6250 Appl Sci Lane, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [McInnes, Kurt A.; Abebe, Zelalem A.; Whyte, Thomas; Wellington, Cheryl L.; Cripton, Peter A.] Int Collaborat Repair Discoveries, 818 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Bashir, Asma; Barron, Carlos; Wellington, Cheryl L.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Rm G227 2211 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada; [Bashir, Asma; Barron, Carlos; Wellington, Cheryl L.] Univ British Columbia, Djavad Mowafaghian Ctr Brain Hlth, 2215 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Cripton, Peter A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Orthopaed, 11th Floor 2775 Laurel St, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Cripton, Peter A.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Biomed Engn, 251-2222 Hlth Sci Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Whyte, Thomas] Neurosci Res Australia NeuRA, POB 1165, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia",ASME,English,0148-0731,
WoS,"A Volumetric Assessment of External Cervical Resorption Cases and Its Correlation to Classification, Treatment Planning, and Expected Prognosis","Introduction: External cervical resorption (ECR) is a relatively uncommon type of external resorption; its treatment planning and prognosis are largely dependent on the clinician's subjective assessment. This study aimed to provide a volumetric assessment of ECR cases while correlating them to the Heithersay classification, treatment decision, and prognosis determined by 3 calibrated, independent evaluators. Methods: A total of 168 ECR cases with corresponding periapical radiographs and cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) imaging were included in this study. An oral and maxillofacial radiologist calculated the volume occupied by the resorptive defects in root structures on CBCT imaging using Amira software (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Also, 3 board-certified endodontists evaluated anonymized and randomized periapical radiographs and corresponding CBCT images in separate sessions. Examiners were asked to provide a Heithersay classification, whether they would surgically repair the ECR lesion, and the expected prognosis of each case. Results: The percentage of radicular volume affected by ECR ranged from 0.5%-58% with a median of 12%. The volumetric quantification of ECR best correlated with classification and prognosis assigned by the independent examiners using CBCT evaluation. The greatest variation in agreement was observed on whether to surgically repair the ECR. However, examiners agreed more uniformly on not to treat when the resorptive port of entry was found on either the lingual or proximal surfaces of the tooth. Conclusions: For the first time, the volumetric quantification of resorptive defects was calculated in vivo and correlated to the Heithersay classification and prognosis. Because the longevity of teeth affected with ECR depends on the integrity of the remaining root, the findings of this study provide important information to help clinicians decide on treatment planning and inform their patients of the expected prognosis. Future studies should focus on automating volumetric assessments of ECR to aid in unbiased chairside treatment planning decisions.",Cone-beam computed tomography; external cervical resorption; invasive cervical resorption; prognosis; repair; volumetric,"Matny, LE; Ruparel, NB; Levin, MD; Noujeim, M; Diogenes, A",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF ENDODONTICS,10.1016/j.joen.2020.04.012,"[Matny, Lea E.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Comprehens Dent, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Ruparel, Nikita B.; Diogenes, Anibal] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Dept Endodont, 7703 Floyd Curl Dr, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Levin, Martin D.] Univ Penn, Dept Endodont, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,English,0099-2399,
WoS,Moderately Acidic pH Promotes Angiogenesis: An In Vitro and In Vivo Study,"Introduction: This study evaluated the effect of different pH values of 4.4, 5.4, 6.4, 7.4, 8.4, and 9.4 on angiogenesis. Methods: Endothelial cells were isolated from the mice molar teeth and placed in 42 Matrigel (Corning, NY)-coated wells, which were prepared and divided into 6 groups (n = 7). Synthetic tissue fluid was prepared and divided into 6 parts, and their pH values were adjusted to 4.4, 5.4, 6.4, 7.4, 8.4, and 9.4. A 2-mL volume from each group was diluted in the growth medium at a ratio of 1:3 and used for tubulogenesis assay. Forty-two 6-week-old mice in 6 groups (n 5 7) were used for choroidal neovascularization (CNV). A 2-mL volume from each group or saline (control) was delivered by intravitreal injection on the day of laser application and 1 week later. Data on the number of nodes, the total length of the branches, and CNV areas (mu m(2)) were determined using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and analyzed with 1-way analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey tests. The correlation was assessed between the tested variables. Results: The number of nodes decreased with changes in pH values as follows: 6.4 > 5.4 > 7.4 > 8.4 > 9.4 > 4.4. The total branch length decreased with pH value changes as follows: 6.4 > 4.4 > 6.4 > 7.4 > 8.4 > 9.4, and the CNV areas decreased with pH value changes as follows: 6.4 > 5.4 > 4.4 > 7.4 > 8.4 > 9.4.

WoS,Sorting of suitable areas for disposal of construction and demolition waste using GIS and ELECTRE TRI,"Inadequate construction and demolition waste disposal create severe environmental impacts in cities when it occurs in an uncontrolled manner. For waste with the possibility of recycling, the appropriate destination would be recycling plants or landfills. In the investigative process, no studies were found that considered the sorting procedure by compensatory and non-compensatory multi-criteria analysis integrated to the Geographic Information System to choose suitable landfills or recycling plants in cities. This study aims to fill this gap with a structured methodology for mapping suitable sites to receive inert waste from small and medium cities. For this, it was considered the identification of relevant criteria and weights definition by Analytic Hierarchy Process method and after performing a sorting procedure by ArcGIS 10.0 software (compensatory aspect) and ELECTRE TRI method (non-compensatory aspect). And then, an aggregate analysis in order to support the decision-making was also developed. An experimental study was carried out with the application of this methodology in a city of the south western of Parana, Brazil, allowing the analysis of criteria such as land use, soil type and slope, as well as distances to urban area, education and health institutions, roads and highways and hydrography network. We combined these data in a multi-criteria analysis to provide an aptitude mapping to identify suitable landfill areas with 5 km(2), and sorted as low, medium and high aptitude classes by ArcGIS software and ELECTRE TRI method. With all that, it shows to be efficient, providing relevant practical and theoretical implications to this theme.

WoS,The effects of probiotics on reducing the colorectal cancer surgery complications: A periodic review during 2007-2017,"Background & aims: To assess the effects of pro-/synbiotic treatment on patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), a systematic review was conducted on randomized controlled trials. Methods: International databanks (ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) were searched from January 2007 to December 2017 using the following keywords: 'colorectal cancer' and 'probiotics'. The search was restricted to original articles published in English. Reference lists of all related studies were also reviewed to find other relevant publications. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 18.0 (IBM, NY, USA). Also, p < .05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 21 clinical trials were retrieved, involving 1831 patients subjected to elective colorectal surgery. The studies included in this review have investigated the effects of probiotics on different aspects of colorectal cancer treatment (p < .05). According to the present study results, probiotics could significantly decrease inflammatory factors, chemotherapy side effects, severe diarrhea, postoperative infectious complications, and duration of antibiotic therapy; shift fecal microbiota in favor of Actinobacteria; and change the tumor tissue microbiota (p < .05). Conclusion: Based on the present review, the preoperative use of pro-/synbiotics as prophylaxis for patients with CRC could improve clinical outcomes. More detailed data about the types of probiotic species and the optimal consumption dose of pro-/synbiotics should be taken in to account in future meta-analysis reviews.

WoS,Theoretical analysis of bacterial efflux pumps inhibitors: Strategies in-search of competent molecules and develop next,"Multi-drug resistance (MDR) bacteria pose a significant threat to our ability to effectively treat infections due to the development of several antibiotic resistant mechanisms. A major component in the development of the MDR phenotype in MDR bacteria is over expression of different-type of efflux pumps, which actively pump out antibacterial agents and biocides from the periplasm to the outside of the cell. Consequently, bacterial efflux pumps are an important target for developing novel antibacterial treatments. Potent efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) could be used as adjunctive therapies that would increase the potency of existing antibiotics and decrease the emergence of MDR bacteria. Several potent inhibitors of efflux pumps have been reported which has been summarized here. All the natural and synthetic EPIs were optimized with Gaussian and Avogadro software. The optimized structures were docked with each class of efflux pumps and their bonding parameters were computed. The theoretical analyses were performed with density functional theory (DFT). Overall, computational study revealed a good trend of electrophilicity and ionization potential of the EPIs, the obtained average values are within in the range of 0.001414 AU +/- 0.00032 and 0.208821 AU +/- 0.015545, respectively. Interestingly, cathinone interacts with most of the efflux pumps among the tested inhibitors. The electrophilicity and ionization potential of cathinone are 0.00198 and 0.2388 AU, respectively. The study opens a new road for designing future-generation target-specific efflux pump inhibitors, as well as one molecule with multiple inhibition abilities.",Antibiotic resistance; Efflux pump inhibitors; Molecular docking; Density functional theory; Bacterial efflux pumps; Computational analysis,"Ghosh, A; Roymahapatra, G; Paul, D; Mandal, SM",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2020.107275,"[Ghosh, Akash; Mandal, Santi M.] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Cent Res Facil, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Roymahapatra, Gourisankar] Haldia Inst Technol, Sch Appl Sci & Humanities, Haldia 721657, India; [Paul, Debarati] Amity Univ, Amity Inst Biotechnol, Sect 125, Noida 201311, India",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,1476-9271,
WoS,PathMolD-AB: Spatiotemporal pathways of protein folding using parallel molecular dynamics with a coarse-grained model,"Solving the protein folding problem (PFP) is one of the grand challenges still open in computational biophysics. Globular proteins are believed to evolve from initial configurations through folding pathways connecting several thermodynamically accessible states in a free energy landscape until reaching its minimum, inhabited by the stable native structures. Despite its huge computational burden, molecular dynamics (MD) is the leading approach in the PFP studies by preserving the Newtonian temporal evolution in the canonical ensemble. Non-trivial improvements are provided by highly parallel implementations of MD in cost-effective GPUs, concomitant to multiscale descriptions of proteins by coarse-grained minimalist models. In this vein, we present the PathMolD-AB framework, a comprehensive software package for massively parallel MD simulations using the canonical ensemble, structural analysis, and visualization of the folding pathways using the minimalist ABmodel. It has, also, a tool to compare the results with proteins re-scaled from the PDB. We simulate and analyze, as case studies, the folding of four proteins: 13FIBO, 2GB1, 1PLC and 5ANZ, with 13, 55, 99 and 223 amino acids, respectively. The datasets generated from simulations correspond to the MD evolution of 3500 folding pathways, encompassing 35 x 10(6) states, which contains the spatial amino acid positions, the protein free energies and radii of gyration at each time step. Results indicate that the speedup of our approach grows logarithmically with the protein length and, therefore, it is suited for most of the proteins in the PDB. The predicted structures simulated by PathMolD-AB were similar to the re-scaled biological structures, indicating that it is promising for the study of the PFP study.",Canonical ensemble; CUDA; 3D-AB off-lattice; Protein folding dataset,"Hattori, LT; Pinheiro, BA; Frigori, RB; Benitez, CMV; Lopes, HS",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2020.107301,"[Hattori, Leandro Takeshi; Pinheiro, Bruna Araujo; Frigori, Rafael Bertolini; Vargas Benitez, Cesar Manuel; Lopes, Heitor Silverio] Fed Univ Technol Parana UTFPR, Bioinformat & Computat Intelligence Lab LABIC, Av 7 Setembro,3165, BR-80230901 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,1476-9271,
WoS,Geo-Measures: A PyMOL plugin for protein structure ensembles analysis,"Although molecular dynamics encompasses several applications, studies focusing on biomolecular systems are central issues of this research area. Such simulations require the generation of trajectory files, which provide a path for the analysis and interpretation of results with biological significance. However, although several programs have been developed in Python language for the analyses of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, they usually require some knowledge of programming languages in order to write or run the scripts using command lines, which certainly hinders the access of MD simulations to many scientists with the necessary biological background to interpret their results. To ease the access to Python packages focusing on MD trajectory analyses, we built a user-friendly and easy-to-install graphical PyMOL interface. Geo-Measures integrates the PyMOL functionalities with MDTraj, a powerful library of trajectory analyses, allowing the users to access up to 14 different types of analyses. Two sample cases are reported here to demonstrate the use of Geo-Measures. In the first example, which involves the use a MD trajectory file of hemoglobin from the MoDEL MD bank, we exemplified the analyses of the following variables: root mean square deviation, radius of gyration, free energy landscape and principal component analysis. In the second case, we built a trajectory file for the ecto-5'-nucleotidase using the LiGRO program to study the carbon alpha pincer angles, to define the secondary structure of the proteins and to analyze the Modevectors.

WoS,Integrating a constraint-based optimization approach into the design of oil & gas structures,"Currently, design optimization is widely applied in civil and mechanical engineering. Optimization strategies are used to enhance the product performance and reduce the cost, lead time and environmental impacts related to the product lifecycle. In this context, evolutionary algorithms are used for determining the optimum solution in engineering problems. The design of complex products, such as those that are engineered to order, often requires the study of subproblems. Modularization is a common practice to reduce the complexity; however, the configuration practices are difficult to be applied in engineered to order products. As a solution, the integration of the optimization tools and model-based simulations is proposed to manage the complexity. However, even when a commercial software is available to support the parameter optimization, there may exist a lack of design tools that can be integrated with the product structure of an engineered to order product. This paper describes a design optimization approach that integrates a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) tool with model-based simulations in a collaborative design context. A platform tool is developed using the .NET and MiniZinc languages. The case study is focused on the design optimization of a 700-ton steel structure.

WoS,A field implementation of linear prediction for leak-monitoring in water distribution networks,"Water distribution networks (WDNs) are complex systems that are subjected to stresses due to a number of hydraulic and environmental loads. As a result, system leaks remain an unavoidable reality. Leaks which are not large enough to become visible at the street level can often go undetected for prolonged periods of time; the presence of smaller leaks can be concealed in system variability. The current paper addresses the problem of leak-detection and localization in WDNs, using a data-driven methodology which utilizes linear prediction (LP) theory. LP has a relatively simple mathematical formulation and has been shown in laboratory studies to effectively capture leak-induced signatures in fluid-filled pipes. In this paper, the performance of LP for leak-detection is verified, using field data in an operational WDN. In addition, a two-part localization approach is proposed which utilizes LP pre-processed data, in tandem with the traditional cross-correlation approach. Results of the field study show that the proposed method is able to perform both leak-detection and localization in full-scale systems using relatively short time signal lengths. This is advantageous in continuous monitoring situations as this minimizes data transmission requirements, which are one of the main impediments to full-scale implementation and deployment of leak-detection technology. In addition to the analysis results, a novel hydrant-mounted data-acquisition system is proposed, along with its unique hardware and software capabilities.",Leak detection; Water distribution networks; Linear prediction; Acoustic signals,"Cody, RA; Narasimhan, S",2020.0,Journal,ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,10.1016/j.aei.2020.101103,"[Cody, Roya A.; Narasimhan, Sriram] Univ Waterloo, Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,1474-0346,
WoS,"Design, synthesis and neuropharmacological evaluation of new 2,4-disubstituted-1,5-benzodiazepines as CNS active agents","Benzodiazepines (BZDs) represent a class of privilege scaffold in the modern era of medicinal chemistry as CNS active agents and BZD based drugs are used to treat different psychotic disorders. Inspired from the therapeutic potential of BZDs as promising CNS active agents, in the present work three different series of 1,5-benzodia-zepines bearing various substitutions at position 2 and 4 of the benzodiazepine core were synthesized by con-densing different substituted chalcones with o-phenylenediamine in the presence of piperidine as a base catalyst. Structural characterization of title compounds was done by using various analytical techniques such as IR, NMR, elemental analysis and mass spectral data. All the synthesized compounds (9a-d, 10a-e and 11a-c) were sub-jected to in vivo neuropharmacological studies to evaluate their CNS depressant and antiepileptic activity. Results of in vivo evaluation data showed that analogue 11b exhibited potent CNS depressant activity which was comparable to the standard drug diazepam. Compounds 10b and 10c displayed significant antiepileptic activity however they were less potent than the standard drug phenobarbitone. Molecular docking studies were per-formed using MOE software to find the interaction pattern and binding mode at the GABAA receptor (PDB Id: 6HUP). The results of the docking studies were in good agreement with the observed in vivo activity and revealed the satisfactory binding mode of the compounds within the binding site of the protein.

WoS,Pressure injury prevalence in Australian & New Zealand hospitals: Systematic review protocol,"Background: Pressure injuries are a global, largely preventable problem. Pressure injuries, and their complications are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates and place a financial strain on health care systems. Pressure injury prevalence studies are conducted regularly within hospitals in Australia and New Zealand, however there is no consensus on the prevalence rate of pressure injuries in these settings. This lack of data synthesis limits the ability of healthcare organisations to evaluate pressure injury practice against national and international benchmarks. Aim: To synthesise data on the prevalence of pressure injuries within Australian and New Zealand Hospitals. Method and analysis: A systematic review of published and grey literature will be undertaken using a two-phase search. Studies will be assessed for inclusion and the Joanna Briggs Institute Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data will be used to assess source quality by multiple authors. Data extraction will be undertaken independently by two authors. Data synthesis will be completed using STATA software and the METAPROP command and where numerical synthesis is not possible, data will be summarised in narrative form. The overall prevalence of pressure injuries will be quantified, and a narrative synthesis of additional outcomes will be undertaken. Discussion: Inclusion of both published and grey literature in this review will enable a precise estimate of pressure injury prevalence rates in these settings to be determined. A narrative review of the methodology used in included studies will also be completed with recommendations made on best practices to promote accurate data collection.

WoS,Analysis of stress induced by plasma disruption on vacuum vessel through multi-physics modeling,"The analysis of the stresses induced on the vacuum vessel (VV) of a Tokamak and its internal components by the plasma instabilities, such as plasma disruptions, also following a Vertical Displacement Event (VDE), is one of the major concern in the Tokamak mechanical design. So the availability of a fast simulation tool for evaluating the different design options and also able to perform parametric analysis is highly attractive to define the project requirements and to verify the conceptual design. To respond to this wish, a methodology based on the multi-physics modeling capability offered by the Comsol (R) software platform was developed. It consists in coupled simulations based on the data sharing between two 2D axisymmetric models, everyone coupled with two corresponding 3D models shifted each other of 10 degrees. In the 2D axisymmetric model of every couple, the magnetic and electric fields generated by the plasma VDE and disruption are calculated imposing the plasma time evolution as input. In the corresponding 3D model only the metallic structures are present and on them the Electric and Magnetic fields are extruded, determining so the induced currents diffusion in the passive conductors. Then the resulting Lorentz's forces are imposed as body loads on the mechanical structures, so a linear stress analysis can be carried out after the constraints assignment. The same procedure is followed with the second couple of 2D/3D models for check purposes, comparing some proper physical quantities, such as the total induced current flowing on the VV. In this paper the methodology is presented by reporting the simulation of a double null plasma VDE, lasting c.a. 100 ms, followed by a full 5.5 MA plasma current quench in about 40 ms, in a medium size Tokamak intended for experimental research purposes.",Stress analysis; Vacuum vessel; VDE; Disruption; Tokamak,"Cocilovo, V; Fresa, R",2020.0,Journal,FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN,10.1016/j.fusengdes.2020.111684,"[Cocilovo, V.] ENEA FSN FUSTEC, Cre Frascati, Via E Fermi 45, I-00044 Frascati, Roma, Italy; [Fresa, R.] Univ Basilicata, Scuola Ingn, Via Ateneo Lucano 10, I-85100 Potenza, Italy",ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,English,0920-3796,
WoS,Development of a real-time framework for parallel data stream processing,"This paper presents the Korean Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) real-time framework for the parallel data stream processing framework (RT-ParaPro). RT-ParaPro is a framework used to develop a program that simultaneously processes data streamed over a real-time network, sends the data over a network, and archives the data in real-time. In most fusion experimental devices, each device processes the data needed for real-time control and transmits them to the other real-time systems in real-time via the network. By using RT-ParaPro, it is possible to simplify the configuration of a program that performs a series of processes and shorten the development time. Unlike other real-time frameworks that focus on real-time control, RT-ParaPro is specialized for the parallel data stream processing and transmission of data over a real-time network. By using this framework, the L-H transition detection system using machine learning (LHML), which determines whether plasma is in low-confinement mode (L-mode) or high-confinement mode (H-mode) in real-time by using machine learning, and the reflective memory (RFM) archiving system, which stores various RFM channel data to MDSplus, has been developed and operated in KSTAR. To evaluate the real-time performance of this framework, we tested the consistency of the thread period by varying the period of the thread. The test results show that the thread control period is consistent. The period of the thread has a jitter of about 8 mu s not only at a low control cycle rate (1 kHz) but also at a control cycle rate of 100 kHz.",Real-time system; Software framework; Real-time network; Data stream processing,"Kwon, G; Hong, J",2020.0,Journal,FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN,10.1016/j.fusengdes.2020.111720,"[Kwon, Giil; Hong, Jaesic] Natl Fus Res Inst, Control Team, Daejeon, South Korea",ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,English,0920-3796,
WoS,Tianjic: A Unified and Scalable Chip Bridging Spike-Based and Continuous Neural Computation,"Toward the long-standing dream of artificial intelligence, two successful solution paths have been paved: 1) neuromorphic computing and 2) deep learning. Recently, they tend to interact for simultaneously achieving biological plausibility and powerful accuracy. However, models from these two domains have to run on distinct substrates, i.e., neuromorphic platforms and deep learning accelerators, respectively. This architectural incompatibility greatly compromises the modeling flexibility and hinders promising interdisciplinary research. To address this issue, we build a unified model description framework and a unified processing architecture (Tianjic), which covers the full stack from software to hardware. By implementing a set of integration and transformation operations, Tianjic is able to support spiking neural networks, biological dynamic neural networks, multilayered perceptron, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and so on. A compatible routing infrastructure enables homogeneous and heterogeneous scalability on a decentralized many-core network. Several optimization methods are incorporated, such as resource and data sharing, near-memory processing, compute/access skipping, and intra-/inter-core pipeline, to improve performance and efficiency. We further design streaming mapping schemes for efficient network deployment with a flexible tradeoff between execution throughput and resource overhead. A 28-nm prototype chip is fabricated with >610-GB/s internal memory bandwidth. A variety of benchmarks are evaluated and compared with GPUs and several existing specialized platforms. In summary, the fully unfolded mapping can achieve significantly higher throughput and power efficiency; the semi-folded mapping can save 30x resources while still presenting comparable performance on average. Finally, two hybrid-paradigm examples, a multimodal unmanned bicycle and a hybrid neural network, are demonstrated to show the potential of our unified architecture.

WoS,A Comparative Evaluation of a Virtual Reality Table and a HoloLens-Based Augmented Reality System for Anatomy Training,"Anatomy training with real cadavers poses many practical problems for which new training and educational solutions have been developed making use of technologies based on real-time 3-D graphics. Although virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have been previously used in the medical field, it is not easy to select the right 3-D technology or setup for each particular problem. For this reason, this article presents a comprehensive comparative study with 82 participants between two different 3-D interactive setups: an optical-based AR setup, implemented with a Microsoft HoloLens device, and a semi-immersive setup based on a VR Table. Both setups are tested using an anatomy training software application. Our primary hypothesis is that there would be statistically significant differences between the use of the AR application and the use of the VR Table. Our secondary hypothesis is that user preference and recommendation for the VR setup would be higher than for the HoloLens-based system. After completing two different tasks with both setups, the participants filled two questionnaires about the use of the anatomy training application. Three objective measures are also recorded (time, number of movements, and a score). The results of the experiments show that more than two-thirds of the users prefer, recommend, and find more useful the VR setup. The results also show that there are statistically significant differences in the use of both systems in favor of the VR Table.",Training; Cadaver; TV; Augmented reality; Biomedical optical imaging; Hardware; Anatomy; augmented reality; comparative study; Microsoft HoloLens; training; virtual reality (VR); VR table,"Vergel, RS; Tena, PM; Yrurzum, SC; Cruz-Neira, C",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS,10.1109/THMS.2020.2984746,"[Serrano Vergel, Ramiro] Univ Arkansas, Emerging Analyt Ctr, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA; [Morillo Tena, Pedro; Casas Yrurzum, Sergio] Univ Valencia, Inst Robot & Informat & Commun Technol, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Cruz-Neira, Carolina] Univ Cent Florida, Agere Chair Comp Sci, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,2168-2291,
WoS,A Novel Homopolar Four Degrees of Freedom Hybrid Magnetic Bearing,"In this article, a novel four degrees of freedom (4-DOF) homopolar hybrid magnetic bearing (HMB) is put forward to reduce the magnetic field coupling of radial 4-DOF. It consists of two pairs of symmetrical radial stators and one rotor, and the radial stators on each side have two pieces, namely, X and Y stator core. Due to the special design of X and Y magnetic poles in the different radial stator cores, the magnetic circuits of X and Y channels are independent of each other. The configuration and operating principle of the homopolar HMB are first discussed, and then, the mathematical model of radial suspension force is deduced by the equivalent magnetic circuit method (EMCM). Besides, some main parameters are given in accordance with the given maximum radial suspension force. Finally, 3-D finite-element (FE) model of the homopolar 4-DOF HMB is established with MagNet software. Meanwhile, the magnetic flux distributions, the magnetic flux density, the force-current relationship of X channel with displacement and current of Y channel are simulated and analyzed. The simulation results indicate that the presented 4-DOF HMB has good performance, and the magnetic fields of X and Y channels decouple well from each other.",Electromagnetic analysis; equivalent magnetic circuit; four degrees of freedom (4-DOF); homopolar hybrid magnetic bearing (HMB),"Ye, XT; Le, QY; Zhou, ZW",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS,10.1109/TMAG.2020.3001935,"[Ye, Xiaoting] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Fac Automat, Huaian 223003, Peoples R China; [Le, Qianyun; Zhou, Zhaowen] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Fac Chem Engn, Huaian 223003, Peoples R China",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,0018-9464,
WoS,Application of Whole-Exome Sequencing in for updates Detecting Copy Number Variants in Patients with Developmental Delay and/or Multiple Congenital Malformations,"Overcoming challenges for the unambiguous detection of copy number variations is essential to broaden our understanding of the role of genomic variants in the clinical phenotype. With the improvement of software and databases, whole-exome sequencing quickly can become an excellent strategy in the routine diagnosis of patients with a developmental delay and/or multiple congenital malformations. However, even after a detailed analysis of pathogenic single-nucleotide variants and indels in known disease genes, using whole-exome sequencing, some patients with suspected syndromic conditions are left without a conclusive diagnosis. These negative results could be the result of different factors including nongenetic etiologies, lack of knowledge about the genes that cause different disease phenotypes, or, in some cases, a deletion or duplication of genomic information not routinely detectable by whole-exome sequencing variant calling. Although copy number variant detection is possible using whole-exome sequencing data, such analysis presents significant challenges and cannot yet be used to replace chromosomal arrays for identification of deletions or duplications.",,"Zanardo, EA; Monteiro, FP; Chehimi, SN; Oliveira, YG; Dias, AT; Costa, LA; Ramos, LL; Novo, GM; Montenegro, MM; Nascimento, AM; Kitajima, JP; Kok, F; Kulikowski, LD",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2020.05.007,"[Zanardo, Evelin A.; Chehimi, Samar N.; Oliveira, Yanca G.; Dias, Alexandre T.; Novo-Filho, Gil M.; Montenegro, Marilia M.; Nascimento, Amom M.; Kulikowski, Leslie D.] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Lab Citogen, Dept Patol, LIM 03,Dr Eneas Car valho Aguiar 155,2nd Floor, BR-05403000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Kok, Fernando] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Monteiro, Fabiola P.; Costa, Larissa A.; Ramos, Luiza L.; Kitajima, Joao P.] Mendel Anal Genom, Sao Paulo, Brazil",ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,English,1525-1578,
WoS,A New Approach for Identification of Clinically Significant DNA Variants in alpha-Thalassemia and beta-Thalassemia Carriers,"Multiple molecular tests are currently needed for accurate carrier testing for thalassemia. Therefore, longmolecule sequencing (LMS) was evaluated as an alternate on the PacBio Sequel platform for genotyping carriers of alpha-thalassemia or beta-thalassemia. Multiplex long PCR was used to generate representative amplicons for the alpha (HBA1/2) and beta (HBB) gene loci. Following LMS, circular consensus sequencing reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome and variants called using FreeBayes software version 1.2.0. In a blinded study of 64 known carrier samples, all HBA1/2 and HBB variants detected by LMS were concordant with those independently assigned by targeted PCR assays. For HBA1/2 carrier samples, LMS accurately detected the common South East Asian, -alpha 3.7, and -alpha 4.2 deletions and four different rare single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). For HBB carrier samples, LMS accurately detected the most common Chinese insertion and deletion variant c.126_129delCTTT and 14 different SNVs/insertions and deletions and could discriminate compound heterozygous SNVs (trans configuration) and identify variants linked to benign SNPs (cis configuration). Overall, LMS displayed the hallmarks of a scalable, accurate, and cost-effective genotyping method. With further test coverage to additionally include detection of other clinically significant HBA1/2 copy number variations, such as the Thai, Mediterranean, and Filipino deletions, LMS may eventually serve as a comprehensive method for large-scale thalassemia carrier screening.",,"Xu, LP; Mao, AP; Liu, H; Gui, BH; Choy, KW; Huang, HL; Yu, Q; Zhang, XJ; Chen, MH; Lin, N; Chen, LJ; Han, J; Wang, Y; Zhang, M; Li, XY; He, DQ; Lin, Y; Zhang, JG; Cram, DS; Cao, H",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2020.05.004,"[Xu, Liangpu; Huang, Hailong; Chen, Meihuan; Lin, Na; Chen, Lingji; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Min; He, Deqin; Lin, Yuan] Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Fujian Prov Key Lab Prenatal Diag & Birth Defect, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hui; Cao, Hua] Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Fujian Prov Matern & Childrens Hosp, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Mao, Aiping; Yu, Qian; Zhang, Xiaojie; Han, Jin; Li, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Jianguang; Cram, David S.] Berry Genom Corp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gui, Baoheng; Choy, Kwong W.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Choy, Kwong W.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Prince Wales Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,English,1525-1578,
WoS,Visualization of flow diverter stent wall apposition during intracranial aneurysm treatment using a virtually diluted cone beam CT technique (Vessel ASSIST),"Purpose Flow diverters (FD) have poor radiopacity, challenging visualization of deployment and vessel wall apposition with conventional neuroimaging modalities. We evaluated a novel cone beam computed tomography (CT) imaging technique that allows virtual dilution (VD) of contrast media to facilitate workflow and ensure accurate assessment of FD wall apposition. Methods We retrospectively evaluated all patients treated for intracranial aneurysms with FD at our institution between November 2018 and November 2019. Undiluted injected dual cone beam CT acquisitions performed post-stenting were displayed with VD software (GE Healthcare). The resulting images were compared with conventional two-dimensional (2D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images. Two neurointerventionalists (Reader 1 and Reader 2, (R1, R2)) independently assessed FD deployment and wall apposition. Confidence in the diagnosis, inter-reader agreement, and X-ray exposure were assessed. Results A total of 27 cases were reviewed. FD deployment and wall apposition scores were 4.2 +/- 1.0 (R1) and 4.0 +/- 1.1 (R2) for DSA and 3.7 +/- 1.2 (R1) and 4.1 +/- 1.0 (R2) for VD. Confidence in the diagnosis was improved with VD, with scores of 3.7 +/- 0.7 (R1) and 4.0 +/- 0.7 (R2) using DSA and 4.9 +/- 0.2 (R1) and 4.9 +/- 0.2 (R2) using VD (P < 0.001). Inter-reader agreement using 2D DSA was improved from moderate (0.49324) to good (0.7272) (P < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in inter-reader agreement in the deployment assessment (P = 0.68) or dose-area product (P = 0.54) between techniques. Conclusion VD imaging with dual cone beam CT enables accurate assessment of FD wall apposition after deployment with greater confidence and improved inter-reader agreement versus conventional 2D DSA alone, with comparable X-ray exposure.",Flow diverter; Cone beam CT; Intracranial aneurysm; Virtual dilution; Imaging,"Hassan, AE; Wise, J; Burke, EM; Tekle, WG",2020.0,JournalEA,NEURORADIOLOGY,10.1007/s00234-020-02507-8,"[Hassan, Ameer E.; Tekle, Wondwossen G.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Neurol, Harlingen, TX 78550 USA; [Hassan, Ameer E.; Tekle, Wondwossen G.] Valley Baptist Med Ctr, Valley Baptist Neurosci Inst, 2121 Pease St,Suite 1D, Harlingen, TX 78550 USA; [Wise, Jim] GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL USA; [Burke, Elizabeth M.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",SPRINGER,English,0028-3940,
WoS,Automating three-dimensional osteoarthritis histopathological grading of human osteochondral tissue using machine learning on contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography,"Objective: To develop and validate a machine learning (ML) approach for automatic three-dimensional (3D) histopathological grading of osteochondral samples imaged with contrast-enhanced microcomputed tomography (CE mu CT). Design: A total of 79 osteochondral cores from 24 total knee arthroplasty patients and two asymptomatic donors were imaged using CE mu CT with phosphotungstic acid-staining. Volumes-of-interest (VOI) in surface (SZ), deep (DZ) and calcified (CZ) zones were extracted depth-wise and subjected to dimensionally reduced Local Binary Pattern-textural feature analysis. Regularized linear and logistic regression (LR) models were trained zone-wise against the manually assessed semi-quantitative histopathological CEmCT grades (diameter = 2 mm samples). Models were validated using nested leave-one-out crossvalidation and an independent test set (4 mm samples). The performance was primarily assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Average Precision (AP, confidence intervals are given in square brackets). Results: Highest performance on cross-validation was observed for SZ, both on linear regression (MSE = 0.49, 0.69 and 0.71 for SZ, DZ and CZ, respectively) and LR (AP = 0.9 [0.77-0.99], 0.46 [0.28-0.67] and 0.65 [0.41-0.85] for SZ, DZ and CZ, respectively). The test set evaluations yielded increased MSE on all zones. For LR, the performance was also best for the SZ (AP = 0.85 [0.73-0.93], 0.82 [0.70-0.92] and 0.8 [0.67-0.9], for SZ, DZ and CZ, respectively). Conclusion: We present the first ML-based automatic 3D histopathological osteoarthritis (OA) grading method which also adequately perform on grading unseen data, especially in SZ. After further development, the method could potentially be applied by OA researchers since the grading software and all source codes are publicly available. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

WoS,Methods for simultaneously evaluating reserve and permeability of undersaturated coalbed methane reservoirs using production data during the dewatering stage,"In this work, a flowing material balance equation (FMBE) is established for undersaturated coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs, which considers immobile free gas expansion effect at the dewatering stage. Based on the established FMBE, five straight-line methods are proposed to determine the control area, initial water reserve, initial free gas reserve, initial adsorbed gas reserve, original gas in place, as well as permeability at the same time. Subsequently, the proposed FMBE methods for undersaturated CBM reservoirs are validated against a reservoir simulation software with and without considering free gas expansion. Finally, the proposed methods are applied in a field case when considering free gas expansion effect. Validation cases show that the straight-line relationships for the proposed five FMBE methods are excellent, and good agreements are obtained among the actual reserves and permeabilities and those evaluated by the proposed five FMBE methods, indicating the proposed five FMBE methods are effective and rational for CBM reservoirs. Results show that a small amount of free gas will result in a great deviation in reserve evaluation; hence, the immobile free gas expansion effect should be considered when establishing the material balance equation of undersaturated CBM reservoirs at the dewatering stage.",Coalbed methane; OGIP; Permeability evaluation; Flowing material balance equation; Gas expansion,"Shi, JT; Wu, JY; Sun, Z; Xiao, ZH; Liu, C; Sepehrnoori, K",2020.0,Journal,PETROLEUM SCIENCE,10.1007/s12182-019-00410-3,"[Shi, Jun-Tai; Wu, Jia-Yi; Sun, Zheng] China Univ Petr, State Key Lab Petr Resources & Prospecting, 18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jun-Tai; Wu, Jia-Yi; Sun, Zheng] China Univ Petr, MOE Key Lab Petr Engn, 18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Zhi-Hua] PetroChina Coalbed Methane Co Ltd, Beijing 100028, Peoples R China; [Liu, Cheng] PetroChina Zhejiang Oil Field Co Ltd, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China; [Sepehrnoori, Kamy] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",SPRINGER,English,1672-5107,
WoS,Simulations Predicting the Ability of Multi-color Simultaneous Photometry to Distinguish TESS Candidate Exoplanets from False Positives,"The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is currently concluding its 2 yr primary science mission searching 85% of the sky for transiting exoplanets. TESS has already discovered well over one thousand TESS objects of interest (TOIs), but these candidate exoplanets must be distinguished from astrophysical false positives using other instruments or techniques. The 3-band Multi-color Simultaneous Camera for Studying Atmospheres of Transiting Planets (MuSCAT), as well as the 4-band MuSCAT2, can be used to validate TESS discoveries. Transits of exoplanets are achromatic when observed in multiple bandpasses, while transit depths for false positives often vary with wavelength. We created software tools to simulate MuSCAT/MuSCAT2 TESS follow-up observations and reveal which planet candidates can be efficiently distinguished from blended eclipsing binary (BEB) false positives using these two instruments, and which must be validated using other techniques. We applied our software code to the Barclay et al.predicted TESS discoveries, as well as to TOIs downloaded from the ExoFOP-TESS website. We estimate that MuSCAT (MuSCAT2 values in parentheses) will be able to use its multi-color capabilities to distinguish BEB false positives for similar to 17% (similar to 18%) of all TESS discoveries, and similar to 13% (similar to 15%) ofR(pl) R(circle plus)discoveries. Our TOI analysis shows that MuSCAT (MuSCAT2) can distinguish BEB false positives for similar to 55% (similar to 52%) of TOIs with transit depths greater than 0.001, for similar to 64% (similar to 61%) of TOIs with transit depths greater than 0.002, and for similar to 70% (similar to 68%) of TOIs with transit depth greater than 0.003. Our work shows that MuSCAT and MuSCAT2 can validate hundreds ofR(pl) R(circle plus)candidate exoplanets, thus supporting the TESS mission in achieving its Level 1 Science Requirement of measuring the masses of 50 exoplanets smaller in size than Neptune.

WoS,Validation of the suppression ratio from a simplified EEG montage during targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest,"Aim: The Suppression Ratio (SR) estimates the percent of the electroencephalography (EEG) epoch with very low voltage, and is associated with neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. We aimed to compare the SR generated by two monitoring devices and determine the association between SR and patterns on amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) and full conventional EEG (cEEG). Methods: Consecutive adult patients treated with TTM after cardiac arrest were enrolled. We compared the SR from the Medtronic Vista monitor (MSR) to the SR generated from the full montage cEEG with Persyst Magic-Marker software (PSR). A blinded neurologist, board certified in epilepsy, scored the 4-channel aEEG pattern and the cEEG background using standardized terminology. Values for SR were compared to aEEG and cEEG categories using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, and to each other using Altman-Bland methodology. Results: 23 adults treated with TTM had a mean core temperature of 33.8 degrees C at the time of SR and EEG background analysis. The MSR was 0% during continuous cEEG background, 23% when cEEG was discontinuous, and 64% during cEEG burst suppression (p = 0.01). The MSR was 0% during aEEG continuous patterns, 34% during aEEG burst suppression, and 46% during flat aEEG (p < 0.001). The MSR and PSR were highly correlated (0.88, p < 0.0001), with minimal bias (0.3%) and excellent 95% limits of agreement (-2.9 to 2.4%). Conclusion: The Suppression Ratio from the Medtronic Vista monitor is highly correlated with the full montage SR from Persyst software.

WoS,A phantom and cadaveric study of radiostereometric analysis in posterior cervical and lumbar spinal fusion,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Detecting pseudarthrosis following spinal fusion is important for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Current diagnostic measures hold certain drawbacks. Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) is a radiographic technique with the capability to measure intervertebral segment changes and may be a novel way of assessing fusion. PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to measure the accuracy and precision of RSA in instrumented posterior cervical and lumbar spinal fusion for measuring intervertebral movement. Further, to gain surgical practice with RSA in spine and determine optimal bead placements. STUDY DESIGN: Artificial bone and cadaveric spine models were used to simulate a 3-level cervical (C3-C6) and a 2-level (L4-S1) lumbosacral posterior spinal fusion to analyze bead placements and to measure RSA accuracy and precision. METHODS: Preliminary RSA bead placements were planned and measured in the artificial model. Secondary bead placements were adjusted slightly in the cadaveric model to consider additional fusion scenarios. Bead spread, detectability, and stability were measured to determine optimal placements. Translational and rotational precision of both models were measured. Accuracy was measured in the artificial spine model. Model-based RSA software was used for analysis. RESULTS: Optimal bead placements were found to be throughout the lateral mass of C3-C6 and in the spinous process, transverse process, and within the screw canal of L4-S1. Detectability was high among all segments. Spread was greater in L4-S1 than C3-C6 due to bead collinearity along the transverse axis of the cervical vertebrae. Translational and rotational RSA accuracy in cervical and lumbosacral regions ranged between 0.005 to 0.014 mm and 0.058 to 0.208 degrees. Translational and rotational precision measured in the phantom models ranged 0.017 to 0.131 mm and 0.058 to 0.394 degrees in C3-C6, and 0.086 to 0.191 mm and 0.200 to 0.369 degrees in L4-S1. Translational and rotational precision measured in the cadaveric models ranged 0.054 to 0.548 mm and 0.148 to 1.386 degrees in C3-C6, and 0.068 to 0.164 mm and 0.100 to 0.270 degrees in L4-S1. CONCLUSIONS: RSA was found to be a feasible radiographic technique in C3-C6 and L4-S1 spinal fusion when measured in artificial and cadaveric models. Optimal bead placements were determined. Bead spread was shown to be better throughout the lumbar region than the cervical region due to anatomical size variations. RSA accuracy and precision were within acceptable RSA criteria. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results from this work contribute to the accuracy, precision, and bead placements for studying RSA in cervical and lumbar spinal fusions. This work may further support the development of clinical studies to assess spinal fusion by evaluating postoperative intervertebral movement using RSA. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,Hybrid MultiGene Genetic Programming - Artificial neural networks approach for dynamic performance prediction of an aeroengine,"Dynamic aeroengine models have an important role in the design of real-time control systems. Modelling of aeroengines using dynamic performance simulations is a key step in the design process in order to reduce costs and the development period. A dynamic model can provide a numerical counterpart for the development of control systems and for the study of the engine behaviour in both steady and unsteady scenarios. The latter situation is particularly felt in the military field. The Viper 632-43 engine analysed in this work is a military turbojet, so it was necessary to develop a model that would replicate its behaviour as realistically as possible. The model was built using the Gas turbine Simulation Program (GSP) software and validated both in steady and transient conditions. Once the engine model was validated, different machine learning techniques were used to estimate (data mining) and predict an engine parameter; the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) has been chosen as the key parameter. A MultiGene Genetic Programming (MGGP) technique has been used to derive simple mathematical relationships between different input parameters and the EGT. These, then, can be used to calculate the EGT value of a real Viper 632-43 engine knowing a priori the input parameters and in any operating condition. Finally, the EGT estimated by this algorithm has been added to the dataset used for the one-step-ahead EGT prediction by Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A time-series ANN was used for the EGT prediction, i.e. the Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) neural network. This network recognizes the input data as a real time series and is therefore able to predict the output in the next time step. It was chosen to use, as forecasting method, the one-step-ahead technique which allows to predict the EGT in the immediately next time step. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

WoS,Auto-landing of UAVs with variable centre of mass using the backstepping and dynamic inversion control,"The paper proposes the design methodology of a new auto-landing system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with variable centre of mass subject to wind shears, wind gusts, and atmospheric turbulences. Starting from the UAV nonlinear dynamics, a new control architecture is developed. It combines the backstepping and dynamic inversion approaches for the control of UAV attitude angles, lateral deviation from runway, flight altitude, and forward speed during the three landing stages (final approach, glide slope, flare). The estimation of the wind shears, wind gusts, and atmospheric turbulences is achieved via a neural network based disturbance observer, included in the new auto-landing architecture. By its software implementation and validation, the robustness to wind type disturbances and the stability of the new auto-landing system are proved. There are cancelled the altitude error, the lateral deviation from runway, while the UAV trajectory is the desired one with continuous and smooth transition from one stage of landing to another.

WoS,Enhancement of low-speed piezoelectric wind energy harvesting by bluff body shapes: Spindle-like and butterfly-like cross-sections,"Fluid-structure interaction can be utilized to harvest the low-speed wind energy for sustaining the low-power sensors for structural health monitoring. To enhance the low-speed wind energy harvesting, this study proposes the novel spindle-like and butterfly-like bluff bodies by coupling both the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and galloping phenomena. Comprehensive wind tunnel experiments are conducted to investigate the advantages of the two bluff bodies in terms of the bluff body cross-sections and installment directions. The experimental results demonstrate that for both the spindle-like and butterfly-like bluff bodies, the vertical installment and small width ratio are beneficial to the performance in a broad range of wind speeds. Compared to a conventional galloping-based energy harvester, owing to the coupling between the VIV and galloping, the vertical spindle-like bluff body with the smallest width ratio can reduce the threshold wind speed of activating the energy harvesting function by over 13%, and improve the maximum voltage output by over 160%. Finally, taking the spindle-like bluff body as an example, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies are conducted by using XFlow software to interpret the physical insight of performance enhancement. The CFD results show that the vertical installment direction and a small width ratio play an important role. The two designs can lead to a stronger aerodynamic force due to the fast vortex shedding, which improves the energy conversion efficiency from the flow-induced vibrations.

WoS,Design of water quality monitoring system for aquaculture ponds based on NB-IoT,"In order to promote the development of aquaculture informatization and monitor aquaculture ponds more accurately and conveniently, this article has developed a water quality monitoring system for aquaculture ponds based on the narrow band internet of things (NB-IoT) technology. This system realizes remote collection and data storage of mull-sensor processor information (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and other environmental parameters), as well as intelligent control and centralized management of breeding ponds. The system uses STM32L151C8 microcontroller and sensor terminal real-time acquisition, such as temperature, pH value, dissolved oxygen. It realizes data aggregation and transmission over a long distance to the Internet of things (IoT) telecom cloud platform through the technology of NB-IoT. The software called Keil implement the data format design of wireless communication module and data transmission. Java is used to develop background monitoring applications for accessing cloud platform, controlling underlying devices and local data processing. It can not only send hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) requests to monitor cloud platform data, but also issue commands to the underlying control module to control the startup and shutdown of equipment such as aerator. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou, JiangSu Province, China. The experimental results showed that the system can obtain water quality parameters in time. The temperature control accuracy is maintained at +/- 0.12 degrees C, the average relative error is 0.15 %, the dissolved oxygen control accuracy is maintained within +/- 0.55mg/L, the average relative error is 2.48 %, the pH control accuracy is maintained at +/- 0.09, and the average relative error is 0.21 %. The system has stable overall operation, real-time and accurate data transmission, which can meet the actual production needs and provide strong data and technical support for further water quality regulation and aquaculture production management.",Aquaculture; The water quality; Monitoring; The internet of things; Narrow band internet of things,"Huan, J; Li, H; Wu, F; Cao, WJ",2020.0,Journal,AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.aquaeng.2020.102088,"[Huan, Juan; Li, Hui; Wu, Fan; Cao, Weijian] Changzhou Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Changzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0144-8609,
WoS,Functional brain changes associated with cognitive training in healthy older adults: A preliminary ALE meta-analysis,"Accumulating evidence suggests that cognitive training (CT) programs may provide healthy older adults (OAs) with cognitive benefits that are accompanied by alterations in neural activity. The current review offers the first quantitative synthesis of the available literature on the neural effects of CT in healthy aging. It was hypothesized that OAs would evidence increased and decreased neural activations across various challenging CTs, and that these effects would be observed as significantly altered clusters within regions of the frontoparietal network (FPN). Online databases and reference lists were searched to identify peer-reviewed publications that reported assessment of neural changes associated with CT programs in healthy OAs. Among the 2097 candidate studies identified, 14 studies with a total of 238 participants met inclusionary criteria. GingerALE software was used to quantify neural effects in a whole-brain analysis. The activation likelihood estimation technique revealed significant increases in activation following CT in the left hemisphere middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex, extending to the superior occipital gyrus. Two clusters of diminished neural activity following CT were identified within the right hemisphere middle frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus, extending to the superior temporal gyrus. These results provide preliminary evidence of common neural effects of different CT interventions within regions of the FPN. Findings may inform future investigations of neuroplasticity across the lifespan, including clinical applications of CT, such as assessing treatment outcomes.",Cognitive training; Activation likelihood estimation (ALE); Neuroplasticity; Functional neuroimaging; Healthy aging,"Duda, BM; Sweet, LH",2020.0,Review,BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR,10.1007/s11682-019-00080-0,"[Duda, Bryant M.; Sweet, Lawrence H.] Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Sweet, Lawrence H.] Brown Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Human Behav, Providence, RI 02912 USA",SPRINGER,English,1931-7557,
WoS,Application of spectroscopic and multispectral imaging technologies on the assessment of ready-to-eat pineapple quality: A performance evaluation study of machine learning models generated from two commercial data analytics tools,"Recently, rapid, non-invasive analytical methods relying on vibrational spectroscopy and hyper/multispectral imaging, are increasingly gaining popularity in food science. Although such instruments offer a promising alternative to the conventional methods, the analysis of generated data demands complex multidisciplinary approaches based on data analytics tools utilization. Therefore, the objective of this work was to (i) assess the predictive power of different analytical platforms (sensors) coupled with machine learning algorithms in evaluating quality of ready-to-eat (RTE) pineapple (Ananas comosus) and (ii) explore the potentials of The Unscrambler software and the online machine-learning ranking platform, SorfML, in developing the predictive models required by such instruments to assess quality indices. Pineapple samples were stored at 4, 8, 12 degrees C and dynamic temperatures and were subjected to microbiological (total mesophilic microbial populations, TVC) and sensory analysis (colour, odour, texture) with parallel acquisition of spectral data. Fourier-transform infrared, fluorescence (FLUO) and visible sensors, as well as Videometer instrument were used. For TVC, almost all the combinations of sensors and Partial-least squares regression (PLSR) algorithm from both analytics tools reached values of root mean square error of prediction (RMSE) up to 0.63 log CFU/g, as well as the highest coefficient of determination values (R 2 ). Moreover, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM Linear) combined with each one of the sensors reached similar performance. For odour, FLUO sensor achieved the highest overall performance, when combined with Partial-least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) in both platforms with accuracy close to 85%, but also with values of sensitivity and specificity above 85%. The SVM Linear and MSI combination also achieved similar performance. On the other hand, all models developed for colour and texture showed poor prediction performance. Overall, the use of both analytics tools, resulted in similar trends concerning the feasibility of the different analytical platforms and algorithms on quality evaluation of RTE pineapple.",Pineapple; Quality; Vibrational spectroscopy; Multispectral imaging; Machine learning; SorfML,"Manthou, E; Lago, SL; Dagres, E; Lianou, A; Tsakanikas, P; Panagou, EZ; Anastasiadi, M; Mohareb, F; Nychas, GJE",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,10.1016/j.compag.2020.105529,"[Manthou, Evanthia; Dagres, Evaggelos; Lianou, Alexandra; Tsakanikas, Panagiotis; Panagou, Efstathios Z.; Nychas, George-John E.] Agr Univ Athens, Sch Food & Nutr Sci, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, Lab Microbiol & Biotechnol Foods, Athens 11855, Greece; [Lago, Sergio-Llaneza; Anastasiadi, Maria; Mohareb, Fady] Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Dept Agrifood, Bioinfortnat Grp, Coll Rd, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0168-1699,
WoS,FastMapping: Software to create field maps and identify management zones in precision agriculture,"Diverse on-farm agronomic data, gathered via precision agriculture (PA), require depuration and joint analysis of multiple georeferenced field characteristics such as crop yields, and soil and topographic aspects. Multivariate analysis of spatial variability has been recommended to understand variation of data within fields and classify sites into zones of broad similarity to support crop management. However, most of the statistical techniques available for spatial data require advanced skills. Cleaning and statistical analysis of big spatial data can only be effectively implemented if there are easy-to-use computer programs integrating the analytical steps. This paper explains the development and implementation of FastMapping, an interactive web application to automatically clean PA raw data, generate spatial variability field maps, and delineate multivariate management zones. The application uses an interface developed in R language that automatically depurates datafiles; in addition, through automatic spatial interpolation of each variable, it allows us to merge data layers on the same spatial grid in such a way that each site within the agricultural field has values of all the measured variables. On this grid, FastMapping identifies homogeneous zones, in a multivariate and spatial way, and provides data reports including validation of the delineated zones. FastMapping outputs for zone delineation were compared with results from Management Zone Analyst (MZA) software in several fields. The new software yielded a similar zoning to that of MZA and added graphs and statistical results that are lacking in most PA software tools. The flexibility of FastMapping to import, clean and visualize PA data in a single computer environment is highly encouraging. FastMapping can be used by the PA community to support site-specific agricultural management.",Web application; Spatial data; Multivariate spatial clustering; Spatial variability mapping,"Paccioretti, P; Cordoba, M; Balzarini, M",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,10.1016/j.compag.2020.105556,"[Paccioretti, P.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Agr, Catedra Estadist & Biometria, Cordoba, Argentina; INTA CONICET, Unidad Fitopatol & Modelizac Agr UFyMA, Cordoba, Argentina",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0168-1699,
WoS,Root anatomy based on root cross-section image analysis with deep learning,"Aboveground plant efficiency has improved significantly in recent years, and the improvement has led to a steady increase in global food production. The improvement of belowground plant efficiency has potential to further increase food production. However, belowground plant roots are harder to study, due to inherent challenges presented by root phenotyping. Several tools for identifying root anatomical features in root cross-section images have been proposed. However, existing tools are not fully automated and require significant human effort to produce accurate results. To address this limitation, we use a fully automated approach, specifically, the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), to identify anatomical traits in root cross-section images. By training Faster R-CNN models on root cross-section images, we can detect objects such as root, stele and late metaxylem, and predict rectangular bounding boxes around such objects. Subsequently, the bounding boxes can be used to estimate the root diameter, stele diameter, late metaxylem number, and average diameter. Experimental evaluation using standard object detection metrics, such as intersection-over-union and mean average precision, has shown that the Faster R-CNN models trained on rice root cross-section images can accurately detect root, stele and late metaxylem objects. Furthermore, the results have shown that the measurements estimated based on predicted bounding boxes have small root mean square error when compared with the corresponding ground truth values, suggesting that Faster R-CNN can be used to accurately detect anatomical features. Finally, a comparison with Mask R-CNN, an instance segmentation approach, has shown that the Faster R-CNN network produces overall better results given a small training set. A webserver for performing root anatomy using the Faster R-CNN models trained on rice images, and a link to a GitHub repository containing a copy of the Faster R-CNN code are made available to the research community. The labeled images used for training and evaluating the Faster R-CNN models are also available from the GitHub repository.",Image analysis; Deep learning; Object detection; Faster R-CNN; Root anatomy,"Wang, CX; Li, XK; Caragea, D; Bheemanahallia, R; Jagadish, SVK",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,10.1016/j.compag.2020.105549,"[Wang, Chaoxin; Li, Xukun; Caragea, Doina] Kansas State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Bheemanahallia, Raju; Jagadish, S.

The present study is a development of a previous work (Chochorowski and Krapiec, 2017). These stations were discovered during excavations conducted by the Polish archaeological expedition of Jagiellonian University in the Sorkappland and Hornsund fjord regions of the Svalbard Archipelago. In total, 5 non-dated samples of the previous work were reanalyzed for these sites: Bjornbeinflyene (2 samples), Palffyodden (1 sample), Schonningholmane (1 sample) and relics from the landing site on the Torrflya coast (1 sample). All samples from these settlements are constructional elements of dwellings, appearing to be prefabricates brought from the continent, and only one of them is a driftwood timber. These floating chronologies were cross-dated against more than 200 master tree-ring chronologies from the Arctic coast, including as well our own data. Cross-dating was performed by CORINA software which includes t-values calculated with different detrending options. As a result, it was possible to successfully date and determine the place of origin of these samples.

WoS,Capabilities for Physical Activity by Turkish- and Russian-Speaking Immigrants Aged 65 Years and Older in Germany: A Qualitative Study,"This study builds upon Sen's seminal capability approach to analyze the interplay of individual and structural factors for immigrants' physical activity (PA) in old age. The authors conducted software-assisted thematic analysis of group interviews with Turkish- and Russian-speaking immigrants aged 65 years and older in Germany (n= 19). The authors present how interviewees perceive diverse resources, environmental, social, and individual factors that shape their capabilities for PA. Age-related health literacy, family support, and access rules to sport opportunities shape both groups' capabilities for PA. Turkish interviewees' continuous bilocation and Russian interviewees' past experience with PA as workplace exercise are two major differences between those groups. Results indicate that capabilities are ambiguous-managed and shaped by individuals, which makes more static terms like barriers and options less helpful for an analysis.

WoS,The Related Factors of Nurses' Participation and Perceived Benefits and Barriers in Health Policy Making,"Background Nurses play a critical role in providing good health services. Purpose The aim of this study was to examine the factors related to the participation of nurses in the provision of health services and the perceived benefits and barriers to their participation in health policy making. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in several hospitals affiliated with the Iran University of Medical Sciences during the first half of 2018 on a sample size of 220 people. A standard, self-management questionnaire was used to collect the data, and SPSS 21.0 software was used for data analysis. None of the demographic characteristics were found to be significantly associated with nurse participation in or the perceived barriers and benefits to health policy making. Results The results of this study show that the participants were involved only moderately in health policy making. Providing written reports on problems or receiving consultation from a related official was the performance item most frequently cited by the participants in terms of involvement, whereas Disappointment in work procedures was the most frequently cited barrier item affecting involvement. Conclusions/Implications for Practice Despite the importance of the nursing role in health polices, this study indicates that nurses participate at only a moderate level in health policy-making activities. Providing more information to nurses regarding health policies, enhancing nurses' image of their job and their perceptions about the importance of their participation in the health policy, increasing partnerships with nurses at the upper levels of health services management, and supporting nursing professional organizations in the field of health policy are potential strategies for encouraging greater nursing participation in health policy making.",nurse; health policy; participation; barriers; benefits,"Barzegar Safari, M; Bahadori, M; Alimohammadzadeh, K",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH,10.1097/jnr.0000000000000385,"[Barzegar Safari, Masoumeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Hlth Econ Policy Res Ctr, Tehran Med Sci Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Bahadori, Mohammadkarim] Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Hlth Management Res Ctr, Mollasadra Ave,Vanak Sq, Tehran 1435916471, Iran; [Alimohammadzadeh, Khalil] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Healthcare Management, Sch Management & Social Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Alimohammadzadeh, Khalil] Islamic Azad Univ, Hlth Econ Policy Res Ctr, Tehran Med Sci, Tehran, Iran",LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,English,1682-3141,
WoS,"Open-label, long-term extension study to evaluate the safety of clascoterone (CB-03-01) cream, 1% twice daily, in patients with acne vulgaris","Background: Androgens foster acnegenic pathways. Objective: To assess the long-term safety of an androgen receptor inhibitor, clascoterone cream, 1%, in patients who participated in phase 3 studies. Methods: Clascoterone cream was applied twice daily for up to 9 months to the face or trunk, or both. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and local skin reactions were evaluated at months 1, 3, 6, and 9, and at any unscheduled visit(s). The statistical analysis was performed using SAS Windows 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Results: The study screened and enrolled 609 individuals (n = 317 clascoterone, n = 292 vehicle from original studies), and 347 completed the study (n = 179 clascoterone, n = 168 vehicle). Overall, 110 patients (18.1%) experienced 191 TEAEs. The most frequently reported TEAE was nasopharyngitis (n = 20). A total of 19 test article-related TEAEs occurred in 14 patients; of these, 9 experienced 9 TEAEs leading to discontinuation. There were 7 serious TEAEs in 6 individuals, but none were treatment related. One serious TEAE led to study discontinuation. Overall, treatment-emergent local skin reactions occurred in 18.1% (110 of 607). The most frequent local skin reactions on the face and trunk were erythema, scaling/dryness, and pruritus, and most were trace/minimal or mild in severity. Limitations: Long-term efficacy was not a primary end point. Conclusion: A low frequency of TEAEs over 9 months of clascoterone treatment was observed.",acne; androgen receptor inhibitor; antiandrogen; clascoterone; cream; long-term safety; topical,"Eichenfield, L; Hebert, A; Gold, LS; Cartwright, M; Fragasso, E; Moro, L; Mazzetti, A",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY,10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.087,"[Eichenfield, Lawrence] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Pediat & Adolescent Dermatol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Eichenfield, Lawrence] Rady Childrens Hosp, San Diego, CA USA; [Hebert, Adelaide] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Dermatol, McGovern Med Sch, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gold, Linda Stein] Henry Ford Med Ctr, Dept Dermatol, Detroit, MI USA; [Cartwright, Martina] Cassiopea Inc, San Diego, CA 92122 USA; [Fragasso, Enrico; Moro, Luigi; Mazzetti, Alessandro] Cassiopea SpA, Via Cristoforo Colombo 1, I-20020 Lainate, Italy",MOSBY-ELSEVIER,English,0190-9622,
WoS,Effectiveness and safety of Suxiao Jiuxin pill in treating acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and Meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Suxiao Jiuxin pill (SX) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treatment. METHODS: An extensive search of four English databases (Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registration Platform) and four Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System) was performed. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) involving SX combined with conventional therapy versus conventional therapy were included. The extracted data included populations, interventions, outcomes, and risk of bias. The cardiovascular events served as the primary outcome. Review Manager 5.3 software was used for data analysis. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were the effect measure. RESULTS: A total of eight RCTs with 979 patients were included. There were 559 patients with unstable angina (UA) in six RCTs and 420 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in two RCTs. Our review showed that SX plus conventional therapy might reduce the incidence of the total endpoint (RR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.68, P = 0.002), with no obvious adverse events (RR: 1.29, 95% a 0.60, 2.77, P = 0.52) compared with conventional therapy for patients with UA. Additionally, SX plus conventional therapy also reduced the incidence of the total endpoint (RR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.68, P = 0.002) compared with conventional therapy in patients with AMI. SX plus conventional therapy also reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (RR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.57, P = 0.001) compared with conventional therapy in patients with AMI. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that SX is beneficial for treating patients with UA or AMI. However, our findings should be treated with caution because of the poor methodological quality of the included trials. Therefore, more multicenter, large-sample, high-quality RCTs are required to provide high-quality evidence. (C) 2020 JTCM.

WoS,A Multi-Agent Simulation Method of Urban Land Layout Structure Based on FPGA,"The unavoidable birth defects for current simulation method make the final simulation results cannot truly reflect the evolution rules of urban land layout. In this way, a multi-agent simulation method based on FPGA for urban land layout is proposed in this paper. The evolution rule of urban eco-land is explored by combination of cellular automata, dynamic reconfiguration and multi-agent methods. Relying on platform of MATLAB software and dynamic reconfiguration of FPGA logic resources, a regional ANN-CA-Agent model for evolution and prediction model of urban land layout is established. MATLAB, FPGA, and ArcGIS are interoperable by programming, and foreground is displayed by the repast tool. The input layer contains 18 data layers, and the output layer contains 6 data layers. A multi-agent model is established for studying the evolution of urban land layout structures. Finally, in order to make calculation results of the model more in line with actual situation and reflect uncertainty of urban system, random factors are added. Example analysis results show that simulation accuracy of the proposed land layout structure reaches 92.4%, which is a high simulation accuracy. Moreover, conclusion shows that speed of urban expansion in the study area from 2007 to 2029 has gradually slowed down, and urban land-use pattern has changed from epitaxial expansion to intensive land-use.",FPGA; Urban land; Layout structure; Multi-agent; Simulation,"Zhou, XC; Fu, WN",2020.0,Journal,MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS,10.1007/s11036-019-01361-0,"[Zhou, Xinchun] Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Inst Phys & Optoelect Technol, Baoji 721007, Peoples R China; [Fu, Weina] Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,1383-469X,
WoS,Enhancement of waste heat recovery from vertical chimney via thermoelectric generators by heat spreader,"This paper presents three-dimensional study on the enhancement of waste heat recovery from vertical chimney via thermoelectric generators (TEG) by using heat spreader. The physical model composes of aligned TEGs mounted on the chimney wall where each TEG is cooled at its cold side by rectangular finned heat sink. The spreaders are installed on the generators & rsquo; cold sides between the generators and the heat sinks' bases. The studied model represents three of the TEGs installed on the chimney wall. Three-dimensional model is presented for the physical model coupling the governing equations of thermal, fluid flow and electrical models and is solved by using ANSYS software. Results indicate that using spreader increases total output generators power by 17% and 42% at spreader length 40 and 140 mm, respectively and pitch 140 mm. The increase of the TEGs power is about 17% and 21% due to using spreader length of 40 and 80 mm, respectively at 80 mm pitch. Using heat spreader with maximum length of 140 mm, increases the conversion efficiency of the lower, middle generator and upper TEGs by 22.2%, 18.8%, and 19.7%, respectively, while the overall efficiency of the system rises by 20.4%. Using spreader with 140 mm reduces the used generators and heat sinks numbers to approximately the half. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

WoS,An inelastic-damage micromechanical model based on the wing- and secondary-cracking mechanisms under dynamic loading,"For most rock materials, there exists a coupling between inelastic deformations caused by crack displacements on micro-crack faces and damage evolution due to nucleation and growth of wing- and secondary-cracks. While rock material is subjected to dynamic loading, the interaction between micro-cracks plays an important role in materials behavior. The self-consistent homogenization scheme is implemented in this paper to consider micro-cracks interaction and determine the equivalent mechanical properties of micro-cracked rock deteriorated by damage evolution. The aim of this article is to develop a self-consistent based micromechanical damage model by taking into account the wing- and secondary-cracking mechanisms accompanied by inelastic strains caused by crack displacements under dynamic compressive loading. While stress intensity factors in tensile and in-plane shear modes at flaw tips exceed the material fracture toughness in modes I and II, respectively, wing- and secondary-cracks are sprouted and damage evolution occurs. For closed cracks, an appropriate criterion for the secondary-crack initiation is proposed in this paper. Moreover, the evolution rule for the secondary-crack is determined based on the principles of dynamic fracture mechanics. The developed model algorithm is programmed in the commercial finite difference software environment for numerical simulation of rock material to investigate the relationship between the macroscopic mechanical behavior and the microstructure. The fracture toughness parameters of the rock samples are experimentally determined. The rock microstructure parameters (average initial length and density of flaws) are studied using scanning electron microscopy. In order to verify the developed model, a series of numerical simulations are carried out to numerically reproduce the Split-Hopkinson pressure bar test results. The numerical simulation results are in agreement with the experimental data. The simulation results demonstrate that the developed micromechanical model can adequately reproduce many features of the rock behavior such as softening in post-peak region, damage induced by wing- and secondary-cracks and irreversible deformations caused by crack displacements on micro-cracks. Furthermore, the softening behavior of rock material in the post-peak region is affected by considering inelasticity and the secondary-cracking mechanisms. Therefore, the rock sample simulation with the coupled inelastic-damage model can increase inelastic deformations in the post-peak region as a result of irreversible strains caused by crack displacements on micro-cracks. The simulation by considering the secondary-crack mechanism leads to an increase in the microcracking process and damage in rock material.",Secondary-crack; Damage evolution; Stress intensity factor; Inelastic strain; Self-consistent; Sungun copper mine,"Ahmadi, MH; Molladavoodi, H",2020.0,Journal,THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FRACTURE MECHANICS,10.1016/j.tafmec.2020.102618,"[Ahmadi, M.

WoS,Understanding fracture of a carbon black filled rubber compound using material force theory,"This paper is based on the determination of important fracture parameters for commercially important rubber blends through experimental and finite element modeling methods. Properties of NR/BR blends, which are mainly suitable for fire applications, of various compositions have been tested under tensile load and the result is utilized to determine the suitable hyperelastic material model. A model proposed by Yeoh has been found to be more relevant to the test materials and is used to represent them in simulation. Single Edge Notched Tensile samples (SENT) are ued for the fracture analysis. The samples are tested for uniaxial Mode I fracture (Tensile), which is the most commonly observed among the three modes of fracture, and crack growth was studied using the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT). A finite-element replica of the test specimen has been created using in-house code, which uses an implicit mesh adaptive method to study the strain potential around the crack tip. The code for each specimen is executed using the commercially available third-party software ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL).

WoS,Feasibility and Accuracy of Aortic Valve Calcium Quantification on Computed Tomographic Angiography in Aortic Stenosis,"Background. Traditionally, quantification of aortic valve calcium (AVC) has been performed with noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) using the Agatston method. This study sought to derive and validate a systematic method enabling AVC quantification using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). Methods. The study included 134 consecutive patients with AS who underwent both NCCT and CTA and were subdivided into derivation (n = 71) and validation cohorts (n = 63). AVC on NCCT (AVC(NCCT)) was quantified using the Agatston method using the software developed for semiautomatic assessment of coronary calcium. On CTA, the mean contrast attenuation of the aorta in Hounsfield units (AortaHU) and SD was measured in the region of interest at the level of the sinotubular junction. Results. Using an adjusted calcium detection threshold of AortaHU D 2 SD, we calculated AVC on CTA (AVC(CTA)) using the same software without modifying other variables. Correlation between AVCNCCT and AVCCTA in the derivation cohort was excellent (r = 0.9679; P <.001). We used a linear regression model to derive a formula for predicting AVC(CTA) that enabled conversion of AVC(CTA) to AVC(Derived) (AVC(Derived) = 1.821 3 AVC(CTA)). Applying this formula in validation cohort, we calculated AVCDerived, which showed excellent agreement with AVCN(CCT) (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.9648; 95% confidence interval, 0.9427-0.9782). Excellent correlation was also found between categorized AVCN(CCT) and AVC(Derived) scores (k = 0.9044; 95% confidence interval, 0.7989-1.0000), with 95.24% (60 of 63) of scores falling within the same severity category. Conclusions. AVC quantification on CTA is feasible with high accuracy and reliability and shows excellent agreement with the standard AVCN(CCT) score. With the systematic approach using dynamic thresholds being largely independent of the scan acquisition protocol, AVCDerived can potentially replace AVCN(CCT), eliminating the need for separate NCCT acquisition solely for AVC quantification.

WoS,Three-Dimensional Modeling of Surgically Implanted Stent-Based Valves in the Mitral Position in Children,"Purpose. In children with a mitral annulus too small to accommodate traditional prostheses, surgical implantation of stent-based valves is a promising option. However no reliable preoperative methods exist to guide patient selection, device sizing, and positioning. We describe a novel methodology to visualize and quantify device fit in 3-dimensional echocardiogram (3DE)-derived heart models. Description. Heart models were created from existing preoperative 3DEs using custom software. Valve models were virtually implanted into the models, and both device fit and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) area were quantified. Evaluation. The 3DEs of 3 patients who underwent Melody valve placement in the mitral position were retrospectively modeled: 1 with LVOT obstruction, 1 with perivalvar leak, and 1 without complications. In all cases 2-dimensional measurements underestimated 3D annular dimensions, and the patient with clinical LVOT obstruction had the lowest predicted LVOT area-to-aortic area ratio (0.5). Conclusions. 3DE-based preoperative modeling of surgical implantation of stent-based valves in the mitral position may improve quantification of mitral valve dimensions and inform risk stratification for potential LVOT obstruction.

WoS,Combustion of nickel hyperaccumulator plants investigated by experimental and thermodynamic approaches,"This work was undertaken to determine whether thermodynamic calculations can predict the amount and composition of ash produced by combustion of nickel hyperaccumulator (HA) plants in the context of agromining. To this end, three HA plants containing about 1 wt% of nickel were submitted to isothermal combustion at 550, 815, 900 degrees C and the solid residues were characterized by complementary techniques (TGA, XRD, ICP-OES, ion chromatography, SEM-EDX), while thermodynamic calculations were performed with the FactSage software using the dry biomass composition as input. We present an in-depth evaluation of inorganics behavior based on the combination and comparison of experimental data and calculations: effect of temperature on ash yield, nature of crystallized phases, ash elemental composition and inorganics volatilization. Our work confirms that equilibrium calculation is a powerful method to evaluate the behavior of inorganic elements during thermal treatment of biomass, despite some lacks in the databases. For the nickel HA plants, an innovative result is that, after combustion, nickel is always in the form of NiO particles, that can mix with MgO to form (Ni,Mg)O solid solutions. These results have direct implications for understanding the combustion process and for better design of the following leaching step aiming at Ni recovery. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

WoS,An integrated methodology for the economic and environmental assessment of a biorefinery supply chain,"A supply chain network MILP model, developed by means of AIMMS software, and a process plant simulation model, developed by means of Aspen Plus (R), are combined for the optimization of a biorefinery network. Optimization of the supply chain network is initially addressed using literature process and economic data. The results are used as input in the Aspen Plus (R) model where the technical and economic performance of the biorefineries is calculated rigorously. The two computational tools are iteratively executed until convergence on number, locations and size of the biorefineries and on process yield to products and total costs is achieved. The final results are used to perform the Economic Value and Environmental Impact (EVEI) analysis of the overall biorefinery network. The methodology is applied to a case study concerning the deployment of cereal straw in Germany to produce ethanol, ethyl levulinate and electricity.

WoS,Correlated synthetic time series generation for energy system simulations using Fourier and ARMA signal processing,"As the contribution of renewable energy grows in electricity markets, the complexity of the energy mix required to meet demand grows, likewise the need for robust simulation techniques. While decades of wind, solar, and demand profiles can sometimes be obtained, this is too few samples to provide a statistically meaningful analysis of a system with baseload, peaker, and renewable generation. To demonstrate the viability of an energy mix, many thousands of samples are needed. Synthetic time series generation presents itself as a suitable methodology to meet this need. For a synthetic time series to be statistically viable, several conditions must be met. The series generator must produce independent, identically distributed samples, each having the same fundamental properties as the original signal without duplicating it exactly. One approach for such a generator is training a surrogate model using Fourier series decomposition for seasonal patterns and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models to describe time-correlated statistical noise about the seasonal patterns. When combined, the Fourier plus ARMA (FARMA) model has been shown to provide an infinite set of independent, identically distributed sample time series with the same statistical properties as the original data [1]. When considering an energy mix with renewable electricity production, several time series of energy, grid, and weather measurements are needed for each synthetic year modeled to statistically comprehend the efficiency of any given energy mix. This includes measurements of solar exposure, air temperature, wind velocity, and electricity demand. These cannot be considered independent series in a given synthetic year; for example, in summer months demand may be higher when solar exposure and air temperature are high and wind velocity is low. To capture and reproduce the correlations that might exist in the measured histories, the ARMA can further be extended as a Vector ARMA (VARMA). In the VARMA algorithm, covariance in statistical noise is captured both within a history as part of the autoregressive moving average and with respect to the other variables in the time series. In this work, the implementation of the Fourier VARMA in the RAVEN uncertainty quantification and risk analysis software framework [2] is presented, along with examples of correlated synthetic history generation. Finally, methods to extend synthetic signals to multiyear samples are presented and discussed.",ARMA; Fourier; nuclear energy; NURER; renewable energy; synthetic time series,"Talbot, PW; Rabiti, C; Alfonsi, A; Krome, C; Kunz, MR; Epiney, A; Wang, CJ; Mandelli, D",2020.0,Conference,6th International Conference on Nuclear and Renewable Energy Resources (NURER),10.1002/er.5115,"[Talbot, Paul W.; Rabiti, Cristian; Alfonsi, Andrea; Krome, Cameron; Kunz, M.

WoS,A comparison of imaging software and conventional cell counting in determining melanocyte density in photodamaged control sample and melanoma in situ biopsies,"Background: Objective methods for distinguishing melanoma in situ (MIS) from photodamaged skin (PS) are needed to guide treatment in patients with melanocytic proliferations. Melanocyte density (MD) could serve as an objective histopathological criterion in difficult cases. Calculating MD via manual cell counts (MCC) with immunohistochemical (IHC)-stained slides has been previously published. However, the clinical application of this method is questionable, as quantification of MD via MCC on difficult cases is time consuming, especially in high volume practices. Methods: ImageJ is an image processing software that uses scanned slide images to determine cell count. In this study, we compared MCC to ImageJ calculated MD in microphthalmia transcription factor-IHC stained MIS biopsies and control PS acquired from the same patients. Results: We found a statistically significant difference in MD between PS and MIS as measured by both MCC and ImageJ software (P < 0.01). Additionally, no statistically significant difference was found when comparing MD measurements recorded by ImageJ vs those determined by the MCC method. Conclusion: MD as determined by ImageJ strongly correlates with the MD calculated by MCC.

WoS,Well-aerated Lung on Admitting Chest CT to Predict Adverse Outcome in COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: CT of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease depicts the extent of lung involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Purpose: To determine the value of quantification of the well-aerated lung (WAL) obtained at admission chest CT to determine prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods: Imaging of patients admitted at the emergency department between February 17 and March 10, 2020 who underwent chest CT were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with negative results of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at nasal-pharyngeal swabbing, negative chest CT findings, and incompleteclinical data were excluded. CT images were analyzed for quantification of WAL visually (%V-WAL), with open-source software (%S-WAL), and with absolute volume (VOL-WAL). Clinical parameters included patient characteristics, comorbidities, symptom type and duration, oxygen saturation, and laboratory values. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters and CT metrics versus patient outcome (intensive care unit [ICU] admission or death vs no ICU admission or death). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to determine model performance. Results: The study included 236 patients (59 of 123 [25%] were female; median age, 68 years). A %V-WAL less than 73% (odds ratio [OR], 5.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7, 10.8; P,.001), %S-WAL less than 71% (OR, 3.8; 95% CI: 1.9, 7.5; P<.001), and VOL-WAL less than 2.9 L (OR, 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.8; P<.01) were predictors of ICU admission or death. In comparison with clinical models containing only clinical parameters (AUC = 0.83), all three quantitative models showed better diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.86 for all models). The models containing %V-WAL less than 73% and VOL-WAL less than 2.9 L were superior in terms of performance as compared with the models containing only clinical parameters (P =.04 for both models). Conclusion: In patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, visual or software quantification of the extent of CT lung abnormality were predictors of intensive care unit admission or death.

Despite these changes and broader access to research results, there are still accessibility barriers. A very small number of conferences and journals state an accessibility policy for the publications in their websites. The production of accessible documents is not a common practice in conferences devoted to accessibility. The purpose of this paper is to present the case study of DSAI 2016 (Software Development and Technologies for Enhancing Accessibility and Fighting Info-exclusion) conference, wherein we were in charge of making accessible its proceedings. We discuss the methods and technical procedures we carried out to turn the original articles in MS Word and LaTEX formats into accessible PDFs and the steps necessary in authoring, conversion and validation.

WoS,Antenatal Corticosteroids for Pregnant Women at High Risk of Preterm Delivery with COVID-19 Infection: A Decision Analysis,"Objective Antenatal corticosteroids given prior to preterm deliveries reduce the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. However, steroid administration in the setting of a viral respiratory infection can worsen maternal outcomes. Therefore, the decision to administer corticosteroids must balance the neonatal benefits with the potential harm to the mother if she is infected with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to determine the gestational ages for which administering antenatal corticosteroids to women at high risk of preterm labor with concurrent COVID-19 infection results in improved combined maternal and infant outcomes. Study Design A decision-analytic model using TreeAge (2020) software was constructed for a theoretical cohort of hospitalized women with COVID-19 in the United States. All model inputs were derived from the literature. Outcomes included maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, along with infant outcomes of death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and neurodevelopmental delay. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were assessed from the maternal and infant perspectives. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine if the results were robust over a range of assumptions. Results In our theoretical cohort of 10,000 women delivering between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation with COVID-19, corticosteroid administration resulted in 2,200 women admitted to the ICU and 110 maternal deaths. No antenatal corticosteroid use resulted in 1,500 ICU admissions and 75 maternal deaths. Overall, we found that corticosteroid administration resulted in higher combined QALYs up to 31 weeks of gestation in all hospitalized patients, and up to 29 weeks of gestation in ICU patients. Conclusion Administration of antenatal corticosteroids at less than 32 weeks of gestation for hospitalized patients and less than 30 weeks of gestation for patients admitted to the ICU resulted in higher combined maternal and infant outcomes compared with expectant management for women at high risk of preterm birth with COVID-19 infection. These results can guide clinicians in their counseling and management of these pregnant women.",preterm birth; COVID-19; antenatal steroids; respiratory infection,"Packer, CH; Zhou, CG; Hersh, AR; Allen, AJ; Hermesch, AC; Caughey, AB",2020.0,Journal,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY,10.1055/s-0040-1713145,"[Packer, Claire H.; Zhou, Clarice G.; Hersh, Alyssa R.; Allen, Allison J.; Hermesch, Amy C.; Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, 3181 Southwest Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97339 USA",THIEME MEDICAL PUBL INC,English,0735-1631,
WoS,Multi-objective vehicle routing and loading with time window constraints: a real-life application,"Motivated by a real-life application, this research considers the multi-objective vehicle routing and loading problem with time window constraints which is a variant of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows with one/two-dimensional loading constraints. The problem consists of routing a number of vehicles to serve a set of customers and determining the best way of loading the goods ordered by the customers onto the vehicles used for transportation. The three objectives pertaining to minimisation of total travel distance, number of routes to use and total number of mixed orders in the same pallet are, more often than not, conflicting. To achieve a solution with no preferential information known in advance from the decision maker, the problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model with one objective-minimising the total cost, where the three original objectives are incorporated as parts of the total cost function. A Generalised Variable Neighbourhood Search (GVNS) algorithm is designed as the search engine to relieve the computational burden inherent to the application of the MILP model. To evaluate the effectiveness of the GVNS algorithm, a real instance case study is generated and solved by both the GVNS algorithm and the software provided by our industrial partner. The results show that the suggested approach provides solutions with better overall values than those found by the software provided by our industrial partner.",Routing and loading; Mixed Integer Linear Programming; Generalised Variable Neighbourhood Search,"Song, X; Jones, D; Asgari, N; Pigden, T",2020.0,Journal,ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH,10.1007/s10479-019-03205-2,"[Song, Xiang; Jones, Dylan] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Math & Phys, Ctr Operat Res & Logist, Lion Gate Bldg,Lion Terrace, Portsmouth P01 3HF, England; [Asgari, Nasrin] Univ Roehampton, Roehampton Business Sch, London SW15 5SL, England; [Pigden, Tim] Optrak Distribut Software Ltd, Suite 6,Hoe Lane, Ware SG12 9LR, Herts, England",SPRINGER,English,0254-5330,
WoS,A comparison of dietary intake between personnel of a gas processing company and a sample population of public employees from Mashhad,"Introduction: An imbalanced dietary pattern may result in a number of non-communicable disorders that include: obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and subsequently impaired quality of life (QOL). Micro- and macro-nutrients play some important roles in maintaining human health. The objective of this study was to compare dietary intake of employees of a gas processing company, who were provided with meals by their employee, with staff from other public employers from Mashhad, in northeastern Iran. Methods: Twenty-four-hour food recall and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were used to evaluate dietary intakes of 654 male employees of Shahid Hasheminejad Gas Processing (SHGP) Company (case group), and 681 randomly selected male public employees from Mashhad as control subjects in this observational, analytic, longitudinal, prospective cohort study. The analysis of the dietary intakes was performed using Dietplan6 software. Results: Dietary macro and micro-nutrients were evaluated: including total energy, fat, MUFA, PUFA, trans fatty acids, cholesterol, starch, fiber, protein, total nitrogen, zinc, phosphor, potassium, calcium, manganese, selenium, iodine, sodium, copper, retinol, carotene, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothen, vitamin B6, biotin, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin C and vitamin D. The intake of macro-nutrients, including: energy, fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, starch, and protein; minerals including zinc, iron, selenium; and vitamins including niacin and vitamin D were higher in the SHGP group, compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The dietary intake of the SHGP group contained lower amounts of several mineral and vitamins, which included: iodine, sodium, carotene, thiamin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, biotin, folic acid, and vitamin C, in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, we suggest it will be important to evaluate the composition of meals provided by companies and organizations, especially those that provide their employees with the majority of their food intake.

WoS,Situation-specific emotional states: Testing Nesse and Ellsworth's (2009) model ofemotions for situations that arise in goal pursuitusing virtual world software,"Scholars have suggested that emotions are evolved adaptations that increase fitness by adjusting the response of the individual to the specific situation. Thus, the particular emotion experienced by an individual should be dependent on whether the situation is a threat/opportunity, in the physical/social domain, and if the outcome is a success/failure. Nesse and Ellsworth (2009) created a model around this idea that predicts which emotions should arise in these particular situations. The current study empirically tested this model using the virtual simulation programSecond Life. 50 (44 female, 6 male,M-age = 21.10 years, Age range: 18-30 years) participants'avatarswere placed in socially and physically threatening and opportunistic situations; further, participants were randomly assigned to succeed or fail at each task.

WoS,RUNX1 variant as a genetic predisposition factor for acute myeloid leukemia,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common hematological malignancy among adults and is characterized by accumulation of immature myeloid cells. Different genetic factors have role in the occurrence of AML. Among different proteins, RUNX1 and BAALC are involved in the development AML. It has been shown that BAALC overexpression is a factor that indicate shorter disease free survival in a subset of AML patients. RUNX1 has been implicated in the development of breast, prostate, lung, and skin cancers. The aim of this study is determination of the prevalence of common polymorphisms in BAALC (rs6999622 and rs62527607) and RUNX1 (rs13051066 and rs61750222) in AML patients compared with healthy subjects. A total of 100 AML patients and 100 healthy control subjects were included in our study. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and the polymorphisms were genotyped by applying ARMS and PCR-RFLP methods. Finally, data was analyzed using SPPSS software. Our results demonstrate a significant association between the RUNX1 rs13051066 and AML in the co-dominant (odd ratio = 6.66, 95% Cl = 1.85-25, p = .006) and dominant (GT + TT versus GG: odd ratio = 6.15, 95% CI = 1.73-21.87, p = .002) models.

WoS,Mining the role of RECQL5 in gastric cancer and seeking potential regulatory network by bioinformatics analysis,"Aim: The role of RecQ protein-like 5 (RECQL5) in gastric carcinoma (GC) is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role of RECQL5 in human GC and its potential regulatory network via bioinformatics analysis. Methods: Bioinformatic analysis was performed using data in the Oncomine database, Kaplan- Meier Plotter online software, MethHC database, catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC), cbioportal database and String database. Then, we verified the association between RECQL5 expression and GC prognosis by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The independent prognostic factors were determined by Cox multivariate analysis. Results: It was found that both the mRNA and protein expression levels of RECQL5 were downregulated in GC samples (P < .05). Low RECQL5 expression indicated a poor prognosis in GC patients and is the independent prognostic factors for GC. No correlation between RECQL5 mRNA and DNA methylation was found using the MethHC database. The analysis of the COSMIC database showed a high proportion of missense mutation in GC. The functional enrichment analysis predicted that RECQL5 plays a role in DNA repair and cellular responses to DNA damage stimulus. RECQL5 might be enriched in homologous recombination pathways and Fanconi anemia pathway. Bioinformatics analysis identified 5 genes, namely POLR2D, POLR2G, DXO, KIN, and EIF2D, that were significantly correlated with RECQL5. Conclusion: The low expression of RECQL5 predicts poor overall survival in GC.

Methods: A mouse model of liver fibrosis induced by CCl4 was established to analyze the effect of HGTLF on liver fibrosis. The expression changes of miRNA after HGTLF stimulation were detected by qRT-PCR. After interference with miR-184 in Th17 cells, the concentration of IL-17A in cell culture supernatants was detected by ELISA and the proportion of Th17 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The relationship between miR-184 and FOXO1 was verified by online software and dual-luciferase reporter system. After HGTLF treatment of Th17 cells overexpressing miR-184, the protein level of FOXO1 was detected by Western blot. Results: HGTLF could significantly improve liver fibrosis in mice. By qRT-PCR, miR-184 was most significantly expressed after HGTLF drug stimulation, and miR-184 was considered to be the major RNA involved in Th17 cell differentiation. Interference with miR-184 in Th17 cells inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells. By online software and dual-luciferase reporter system assay, the direct interaction of miR-184 with FOXO1 was confirmed. After HGTLF treatment of Th17 cells overexpressing miR-184, FOXO1 protein levels were significantly up-regulated and inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells, which was reversed by miR-184 inhibitors.

WoS,Design of a Host Interface Logic for GC-Free SSDs,"Garbage collection (GC) and resource contention on I/O buses (channels) are among the critical bottlenecks in solid-state drives (SSDs) that cannot be easily hidden. Most existing I/O scheduling algorithms in the host interface logic (HIL) of state-of-the-art SSDs are oblivious to such low-level performance bottlenecks in SSDs. As a result, SSDs may violate quality of service (QoS) requirements by not being able to meet the deadlines of I/O requests. In this paper, we propose a novel host interface I/O scheduler that is both GC aware and QoS aware. The proposed scheduler redistributes the GC overheads across noncritical I/O requests and reduces channel resource contention. Our experiments with workloads from various application domains revealed that the proposed client-level SSD scheduler reduces the standard deviation for latency by 52.5% and the worst-case latency by 86.6%, compared to the state-of-the-art I/O schedulers used for the HIL. In addition, for I/O requests smaller than a superpage, the proposed scheduler avoids channel resource conflicts and reduces latency by 29.2% in comparison to the state-of-the-art I/O schedulers. Furthermore, we present an extension of the proposed I/O scheduler for enterprise SSDs based on the NVMe protocol.",Quality of service; Software; Parallel processing; Protocols; Performance evaluation; Standards; Complexity theory; Garbage collection (GC); host interface; solid-state disk (SSD),"Jung, M; Choi, W; Kwon, M; Srikantaiah, S; Yoo, J; Kandemir, MT",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS,10.1109/TCAD.2019.2919035,"[Jung, Myoungsoo; Kwon, Miryeong; Kandemir, Mahmut Taylan] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Choi, Wonil] Penn State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Srikantaiah, Shekhar] Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA; [Yoo, Joonhyuk] Daegu Univ, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Gyongsan 38453, South Korea",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,0278-0070,
WoS,The Dynamics of Openness and the Role of User Communities: A Case Study in the Ecosystem of Open Source Gaming Handhelds,"To remain competitive, it is critical for firms to integrate external sources of knowledge. However, finding the right degree of openness is challenging, especially in complex open innovation ecosystems. The interdependencies and dynamics related to the choice of openness are not well-understood. This paper investigates the role of openness as a competitive mechanism. Specifically, we research how openness affects firms' interactions with user communities and how it changes the preference structure of customers. We build a longitudinal case study in the open source gaming handheld industry and trace the evolution and the dynamics of firms, user communities, and their interactions. We find that a suboptimal level of openness can pose a threat to a firm's very existence. Further, we identify repeated patterns characterizing the dynamics in the ecosystem.

WoS,Choosing the Appropriate System for Cloud Computing Implementation by Using the Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy CODAS Multiattribute Decision-Making Method (Case Study: Faculty of New Sciences and Technologies of Tehran University),"The development of information and communications technology has led organizations to use various solutions to meet their communication needs. One of the best practices for this purpose is the use of cloud computing. Cloud computing allows users to access IT-based services without having to specialize in or control technology infrastructure. At the moment, there are several software applications for implementation of cloud computing in organizations, which make it difficult to select the appropriate tool for the organization. This paper aims to help select the appropriate software for cloud computing system implementation at the Faculty of New Sciences and Technologies, Tehran University. For this purpose, at first, the appropriate criteria are extracted from the related literatures and then finalized using expert opinions. Then, by using an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy CODAS multiattribute decision-making method, the criteria are weighted and the alternatives are prioritized. The results indicate that the open stack cloud computing system can be selected as the best alternative. Choosing this alternative can be due to its remarkable distinction in criteria such as performance, system reliability and security, system stability, usability, serviceability, and being open source. According to the experts of this project, the most important criteria for decision making are software availability and system reliability and security.",Cloud computing; Software; Decision making; Organizations; Hardware; Computer architecture; Reliability; Cloud computing system; interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy codas method; multiattribute decision making; open stack cloud computing system,"Dahooie, JH; Vanaki, AS; Mohammadi, N",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT,10.1109/TEM.2018.2884866,"[Dahooie, Jalil Heidary] Univ Tehran, Dept Ind Management, Dept Technol Management, Fac Management, Tehran 141556311, Iran; [Vanaki, Amir Salar] Univ Tehran, Dept Mkt, Fac Management, Tehran 141556311, Iran; [Mohammadi, Navid] Univ Tehran, Dept Entrepreneurship, Fac Management, Tehran 141556311, Iran",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,0018-9391,
WoS,Coupled Seepage-Stress Analysis of Selected Roller-Compacted Concrete Gravity Dam with Upstream Impervious Layer Considering the Seepage Behavior of Interface Thickness,"The characteristic of seepage through the roller-compacted concrete gravity dams (RCCDs) is inhomogeneous, anisotropic and significantly different from the seepage through conventional gravity dams. This is due to the internal interfaces formed by thin rolling of layers which are weak links and the main channels for seepage. The provision ofan upstream impervious layer (UIL) or less pervious upstream layermay efficiently reduce the excessive seepage in RCCDs. Several works such as those of Li et al. (Water Sci Eng 8(4):326-334,2015) considered the upstream less pervious layer constructed with different concrete materials; however, the properties of interface thickness have not been included in their analysis. The present study attempts to carry out a seepage analysis of RCCDs with an upstream less pervious layer of different types of concrete materials including three-graded RCC, two-graded RCC, conventional vibrate concrete and grout-enriched vibrated RCC with a thickness of 2-3 m considering the significant properties of interface layers, viz. thickness and permeability. The results of the analysis emphasize the effect of less pervious upstream layer or UIL thickness on controlling seepage and also facilitate in understanding its effect on stresses. The property of RCC considered as inhomogeneous multi-laminated medium can be described by tangential and normal major coefficients of the permeability of the layer which depend on the coefficient of permeability and the thickness of the layer following cubic law. These properties are expected to simulate the seepage behavior of RCCD, and also the changes in the mechanical properties such as the elastic modulus with time and temperature are considered to predict the stress behavior of the structure. RCC dams are more pervious than conventional concrete dams and seepage through the dam exerts pore pressure throughout the body of the dam. From the point of its significance, considering the effect of seepage as body force is more realistic than considering it as an external force, viz. uplift pressure at the base of the dam. This method of analysis also facilitates in carrying out stress analysis of dam and foundation together. Hence, a coupled seepage-stress interaction is carried out while analyzing the selected section of RCCD with and without UIL using ABAQUS software. The results provide essential parameters such as pore pressure, stresses required to select the thickness and material of anti-seepage structure.",RCCD; Age-dependent elastic modulus; Interface thickness; Upstream impervious layer; Conventional vibrated concrete (CVC); Grout-enriched vibrated RCC (GEVR); Coupled seepage-stress analysis,"Meena, C; Praveen, TV; Parvathi, IS",2020.0,Journal,INDIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL,10.1007/s40098-019-00376-4,"[Meena, Chowdari; Praveen, T.

WoS,"COVID-19 pandemic predictions using the modified Bateman SIZ model and observational data for Heidelberg, Germany: Effect of vaccination with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, coronavirus testing and application of the Corona-Warn-App","Aims of the study: Published data show that the current progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Heidelberg, Germany, despite the current lockdown, could continue into 2021 and become more severe. We have used the modified Bateman SIZ algorithm to predict the effects of interventional measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: Model parameters, e.g., doubling time and rate of decrease in the number of infectious persons were obtained from published reports. Predictions were made for the status quo on June 1, 2020, and for interventional measures obtained for 4 scenarios. These included vaccination of the whole population using a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine having an efficacy of 50% and 100%, mass-testing for COVID-19 coronavirus and application of the Corona-Warn-App. Results: The principle findings were 1) without new measures to control the pandemic, the daily number of infectious persons could reach a peak of > 4,500 daily within 18 months when > 67,000 persons would have been infected. This could be prevented by using a vaccine with 50% efficacy which was almost equally effective as a vaccine with 100% efficacy. Application of the Corona-Warn-App was the most effective method and more effective than testing for COVID-19. The methodology used has been described in detail to enable other researchers to apply the modified Bateman SIZ model to obtain predictions for COVID-19 outbreaks in other regions. Application of the model has been verified by independent investigators using different commercial software packages. Conclusion: The modified Bateman SIZ model has been verified and used to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Heidelberg. Lockdown measures alone are insufficient to control the pandemic during 2021. Vaccination, diagnostic tests, and use of the Corona-Warn-App with quarantine could successfully control the spread of the coronavirus infection in the community. The Corona-Warn-App applied correctly may be the most effective. The model showed that vaccination with 50% efficacy is almost as effective as vaccination with 100% efficacy.",COVID-19 disease; prediction scenarios; SIZ model; SIR model; modified Bateman model; interventional measures; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; testing for coronavirus; Corona-Warn-App; lock-down; Heidelberg,"Braun, P; Haffner, S; Woodcock, BG",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS,10.5414/CP203846,"[Braun, Peter; Woodcock, Barry G.] Arbeitsgemeinschaft Immunoglobuline Anticanc Anti, Rodermark, Germany; [Haffner, Steffen] Paul Ehrlich Inst, Langen, Germany",DUSTRI-VERLAG DR KARL FEISTLE,English,0946-1965,
WoS,Bioavailability study of two 81-mg coated tablet formulations of acetylsalicylic acid in fed healthy subjects,"Objective: To perform a comparative bioavailability study between a test (re-formulation) and a reference acetylsalicylic acid formulation (Ecasil-81, 81 mg coated tablet) in healthy subjects under fed condition. Materials and methods: Healthy subjects (n = 48) were included in this mono-centric, open-label, randomized, two-way crossover pharmacokinetic study. They received a single 81-mg oral dose of a test or a reference formulation of acetylsalicylic acid under fed condition, with a 7-day washout period between the treatments. Blood samples were collected over a period of 36 hours. The salicylic acid plasma concentration was measured by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using WinNonlin software. Results: The geometric mean and 90% confidence interval of test/reference formulation ratios were 109.32% (102.54 - 116.54%) and 106.94% (102.97 - 111.07%) for salicylic acid C-max and AUC(0-last), respectively. Food decreased the AUC and C-max (p < 0.001) and delayed the t(max) (p = 0.0077). The investigated women presented higher AUC(0-infinity) and C-max values (p < 0.001) than men. The clinical and laboratory exams did not show significant alterations. Conclusion: The re-formulation is bioequivalent to the reference formulation regarding the absorption extent and rate in fed healthy subjects.

WoS,PDGuard: an architecture for the control and secure processing of personal data,"Online personal data are rarely, if ever, effectively controlled by the users they concern. Worse, as demonstrated by the numerous leaks reported each week, the organizations that store and process them fail to adequately safeguard the required confidentiality. In this paper, we proposepdguard, a framework that defines prototypes and demonstrates an architecture and an implementation that address both problems. In the context ofpdguard, personal data are always stored encrypted as opaque objects. Processing them can only be performed through thepdguard application programming interface (api), under data and action-specific authorizations supplied online by third party agents. Through these agents, end-users can easily and reliably authorize and audit how organizations use their personal data. A static verifier can be employed to identify accidentalapimisuses. Following a security by design approach,pdguard changes the problem of personal data management from the, apparently, intractable problem of supervising processes, operations, personnel, and a large software stack to that of auditing the applications that use the framework for compliance.

This study aims to investigate the factors that complementors employ in assessing their current partnerships in markets with network externalities. Survey data was collected from the chief-level executives of complementors in software industries. The results show that network size of partner's technologies and complementors' technological compatibility positively influence partnership retention. Complementors' technological lock-in positively moderates the relationship between network size and partnership retention. Technological uncertainty of partner's technologies negatively moderates the relationship among network size, technological lock-in, and partnership retention. But it positively moderates the relationship among complementors' technological compatibility, technological lock-in, and partnership retention.

WoS,L-1 adaptive pitch angle controller of wind energy conversion systems,"In conditions of above rated wind speed, the power output of a wind turbine should be maintained at rated power to prevent overheating of generators and power electronics systems. Furthermore, extreme wind conditions, such as wind gusts, can even lead to shut-downs. In this paper, a novel L-1 adaptive controller is designed for blade pitch control of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) to achieve stable output power and generator speed, in the presence of turbulent wind conditions. Firstly, the pitch regulated variable-speed wind turbine is modeled as a non-affine nonlinear system with uncertainties. Subsequently, the L-1 adaptive controller is introduced, which consists of three elements: state predictor, adaptive law, and control law. Without the requirement of exact system dynamics and wind speed measurement, uniformly bounded transient power response can be achieved. Compared with traditional methods adopted in industries, L-1 adaptive controller is more robust and can achieve better transient control performance. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is verified via extensive simulation studies on a professional GH Bladed software package. (C) 2020 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Combined land surface emissivity and temperature estimation from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS,"Remote sensing of Land Surface Temperature (LST) generally requires atmospheric parameters and the emissivity (epsilon) of the target to be estimated. The atmospheric up- and downwelling radiances and transmittance can be accurately modelled using radiative transfer models and profiles of relative humidity and temperature, either measured by radiosonde probes or retrieved from assimilating weather models. The estimation of epsilon is a large source of uncertainty in the resulting LST product, and there are various approaches using multi-angle observations, multispectral optical or multispectral thermal infrared imagery. In this paper, the estimation of LST from the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) on board Landsat 8 is evaluated using more than 6 years of in situ temperature measurements from a network of 14 Autonomous Weather Stations (AWS) in Belgium. epsilon is estimated from concomitant atmospherically corrected imagery from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) using two new neural network approaches trained on ECOSTRESS spectra, and an established NDVI based method. Results are compared to using epsilon = 1 and the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset. LST retrievals from L8/TIRS perform well for all emissivity data sources for > 500 matchups with AWS subsoil temperature measurements: Mean Differences 0.8-3.7 K and unbiased Root Mean Squared Differences of 2.9-3.5 K for both B10 and B11. The use of unity emissivity gives the best results in terms of MD (0.8 K) and unb-RMSD (3 K). Similar ranges of unb-RMSD are found for > 500 matchups with broadband radiometer temperatures (2.6-3.1 K), that have lower absolute MD values (-2.2-0.6 K). For the radiometer temperatures, both the neural net approaches gave lowest MD, in the best case +/- 0.1 K. The present investigation can hence recommend the neural nets to derive epsilon for the retrieval of LST over the AWS in Belgium. Using published matchup results from other authors however, no single source of epsilon data performed better than epsilon = 1, but this could be due to their low number of matchups. Further efforts for estimating representative pixel average emissivities are needed, and establishing a denser in situ measurement network over varied land use, with rather homogeneous land cover within a TIRS pixel, may aid further validation of a per pixel and per scene epsilon estimates from multispectral imagery. AWS data seems valuable for evaluation of satellite LST, with the advantage of a much lower cost and higher potential matchup density compared to conventional radiometers.",Emissivity; Surface temperature; Atmospheric correction; Thermal infrared; Landsat 8; TIRS; OLI; Neural network,"Vanhellemont, Q",2020.0,Journal,ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.06.007,"[Vanhellemont, Quinten] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Operat Directorate Nat Environm, Vautierstr 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",ELSEVIER,English,0924-2716,

WoS,PathPair2Vec: An AST path pair-based code representation method for defect prediction,"Software project defect prediction (SDP) can predict the bug probability of software by their features and allocate their testing efforts. The existing software defect prediction methods can be divided into two categories: methods based on traditional handcrafted features and methods based on automatically made abstract features, especially those made by deep learning. The current research indicates that deep learning-based automatic features can achieve better performance than handcrafted features. Code2vec (Alon et al. 2019) is one of the best source code representation models, which leverages deep learning to learn automatic representations from code. In this paper, inspired by code2vec, we propose a new AST path pair-based source code representation method (PathPair2Vec) and apply it to software project defect prediction. We first propose the concept of the short path to describe each terminal node and its control logic. Then, we design a new sequence encoding method to code the different parts of the terminal node and its control logic. Finally, by pairs of short paths, we describe the semantic information of code and fuse them by an attention mechanism. Experiments on the PROMISE dataset show that our method improves the F1 score by 17.88% over the state-of-the-art SDP method, and the AST path pair-based source code representation can better identify the defect features of the source code.",Defect prediction; AST path; Deep learning; Representation learning,"Shi, K; Lu, Y; Chang, JF; Wei, Z",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER LANGUAGES,10.1016/j.cola.2020.100979,"[Shi, Ke; Lu, Yang; Chang, Jingfei; Wei, Zhen] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yang; Wei, Zhen] Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Safety Crit Ind Measurement & Contro, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,2590-1184,
WoS,Concurrent tissue engineering and infection prophylaxis utilising stable dual action amoxicillin loaded scaffolds,"Scaffolds have proven to be beneficial biocompatible wound healing enhancers, however they don't guard against wound infections. The aim of this study is to formulate scaffolds loaded with Amoxicillin (AMX), a broad spectrum antibiotic to have a dual action of acceleration of wound healing as well as prevention of infection of the wound while simultaneously preserving AMX stability. A 24 full factorial design was applied to study the effect of the type of protein polymer (collagen/gelatin), type of crosslinker (chitosan/alginate), ratio of polymer to cross linker (70:30, 60:40) and the total percentage of polymers (4%, 16%) on the porosity, hardness and in vitro AMX release of the prepared scaffolds. The extent of cross linking between polymers used was also simulated using Maestro (R) software. The morphology, compatibility, release and stability of the optimized formula was studied on vitro as well as in vivo activity by determining the wound healing rate as well as histopathological and biochemical analysis of MMP9 and TNF-alpha in rats. Optimized AMX loaded scaffolds formed of collagen/chitosan was found to have superior properties with porous structure, 8.62 +/- 0.32 Kp hardness, 0.984 +/- 0.068 porosity, 98.65 +/- 7.62% drug content as well as sustained release of AMX over 24 h. The optimized formula has shown good stability properties in accelerated conditions over 6 months. Histopathological studies confirmed the enhanced wound healing properties of the optimized AMX loaded scaffolds as well as significantly reduced inflammation markers (MMP9 and TNF-alpha) in rats compared to the untreated groups.

WoS,Resource-Efficient Quantum Computing by Breaking Abstractions,"Building a quantum computer that surpasses the computational power of its classical counterpart is a great engineering challenge. Quantum software optimizations can provide an accelerated pathway to the first generation of quantum computing (QC) applications that might save years of engineering effort. Current quantum software stacks follow a layered approach similar to the stack of classical computers, which was designed to manage the complexity. In this review, we point out that greater efficiency of QC systems can be achieved by breaking the abstractions between these layers. We review several works along this line, including two hardware-aware compilation optimizations that break the quantum instruction set architecture (ISA) abstraction and two error-correction/information-processing schemes that break the qubit abstraction.

WoS,Blade number effect on the optimal energy efficiency for a modified Savonius rotor,"In this paper, the effect of the number of blades on the optimal energy utilisation efficiency for a modified Savonius rotor with rotor diameter of 4 m is investigated by computational fluid dynamics simulation using a uniform test method. The appropriate computational domain of a numerical model is determined by first analysing the relative error of the outlet wind velocity on the outflow boundary of the domain. Taking the rotor rotation speed, the blade width and blade installation angle of the modified Savonius rotor as three key factors, it obtains the optimal energy utilisation efficiencies for the modified Savonius rotors with eight, nine and ten blades by transient numerical simulations under the condition of wind velocity of 8 m/s. The sliding mesh and the Piso (pressure implicit with splitting of operators) scheme are utilised in Fluent software simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the optimum wind energy utilisation efficiency rises and the corresponding blade width decreases with the number of blades.",energy conservation; renewable energy; wind loading & aerodynamics,"Zhao, TY; Zhang, X; Zheng, MS",2020.0,Journal,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENERGY,10.1680/jener.19.00031,"[Zhao, Tianyu; Zhang, Xiao; Zheng, Maosheng] Northwest Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Xian, Peoples R China",ICE PUBLISHING,English,1751-4223,
WoS,"Bank Buildings, Belfast, UK: making safe after a fire","In August 2018, a fire badly damaged a listed building in the centre of Belfast. This left the perimeter walls standing and the inside largely destroyed. Because of the dangerous nature of the structure, the surrounding area was closed. This paper describes the engineering aspects of the approach to making the remaining structure safe to allow the surrounding area to reopen and to start the rebuilding works on the retained building. The design approach to the public safety cordon involved the use of empirical techniques, as well as advanced simulation software. The design approach for the facade-retention scheme was complicated by the poor ground and buried services, as well as having to allow for installation with no access inside the building. The solution involved the use of shipping containers as structural components, as well as fibre-reinforced foundation rafts. The scheme has been successfully installed, and access to the city centre has been reinstated.",fire engineering; safety & hazards; temporany works,"Lohmann, T; McClafferty, J",2020.0,Journal,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-FORENSIC ENGINEERING,10.1680/jfoen.19.00026,"[Lohmann, Tim] Wentworth House Partnership, Esher, England; [McClafferty, John] Keltbray, Esher, England",ICE PUBLISHING,English,2043-9903,
WoS,Assessment of a concrete cable-stayed bridge after replacement of the closure segment,"The concept of replacement of the closure segment (RCS) emerged originally in a strengthening project for a concrete cable-stayed bridge and was intended to deal with a failure in the closure segment of the main girder. The construction procedure of RCS includes removing the failed closure segment, reconstructing the closure segment and finally improving the connection between the new closure segment and the original residual part of the main girder. Thus, a relatively complex conversion in structural state is involved. To assess the completed bridge after RCS, a finite-element model of a typical bridge is developed by using the software Dr. Bridge, and then a construction stage analysis is performed in the present study. Numerical results show that RCS eradicated the hidden structural safety danger while the structural integrity was improved to a certain extent. However, RCS had no significant influence on the geometric profile of the bridge deck, on the horizontal displacement at the top of each pylon and on tensions in the cable stays. As the stress condition in the new closure segment and associated joints between segments could not be improved by mere RCS, other strengthening measures should be taken to achieve a further structural state adjustment for the completed bridge. As a novel strengthening idea, RCS has a comparable advantage and remarkable economic benefit in dealing with local failure in the structure. Inevitably, it has some limitations in practical use.","bridges; failure; rehabilitation, reclamation & renovation","Li, HJ",2020.0,Journal,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-FORENSIC ENGINEERING,10.1680/jfoen.19.00024,"[Li, Hongjiang] Minist Transport, Res Inst Highway, Beijing, Peoples R China",ICE PUBLISHING,English,2043-9903,
WoS,Numerical simulation on methane-hydrogen explosion in gas compartment in utility tunnel,"To explore the sustainability of urban utility tunnel and the possibility for methane/hydrogen mixture transportation, FLACS, the gas explosion simulation software, was used to study the explosion in gas compartment in utility tunnel, and the fuel are 100%CH4, 90%CH4+10% H-2, 80%CH4+20% H-2 respectively. The results show that with the increase of proportion of H-2, vapour cloud with same volume leads to higher overpressure, which increase 16% averagely in 10% H-2 and 32% in 20% H-2; but in long-narrow structure confined space, the length and the height of vapour cloud affect more than the total mass of fuel; the ventilation opening and door can prevent the fire transfer but can prevent the shock wave and control overpressure; for the situation that ignition position is closed the firefighting wall, if the fuel is enough, the peak overpressure shows at the wall rather than other closed position form the ignition position, so the firefighting wall should be reinforced; for people in utility tunnel, they will not be hurt by shock wave but by fire because of the board range, so the risk of burn exists that people must leave compartment immediately.

WoS,A 2-D CFD model for the decompression of carbon dioxide pipelines using the Peng-Robinson and the Span-Wagner equation of state,"Pressurized liquefied gases such as carbon dioxide are transported at a pressure above their saturation pressure. Therefore, if a pipeline transporting this substance ruptures, an abrupt expansion occurs, caus-ing the flashing of the fluid. Computational tools that predict how fast a depressurization develops, help to assess the consequences of potential pipeline rupture scenarios. This paper describes the develop-ment of a 2-D full-bore rupture decompression model to simulate the transient depressurization of a pipeline transporting pure liquefied CO2, using ANSYS Fluent as CFD software. The scope of work focuses on incorporating non-equilibrium phase transition, while addressing the calculation of properties for metastable liquid. Additionally, it includes the comparison of model predictions when implementing two thermodynamic approaches: the Peng-Robinson Equation of State (EoS), and correlations developed in this work based on the Span-Wagner EoS. It was found that the thermodynamic approach is deemed to have a predominant effect on the arrival time of the decompression wave front at different locations along the computational domain, while the mass transfer coefficient in the source terms (C) governs the phase transition and the pressure plateau representing this phenomenon.

WoS,Investigation of airflow field in the upper airway under unsteady respiration pattern using large eddy simulation method,"In this paper, the airflow field in the upper airway under unsteady respiration process is predicted using large eddy simulation. The geometrical model is created by combining a popular cast-based mouth-throat model with tracheo-bronchial airways modeled with a trumpet-shaped conduit. The respiration process is simulated by sinusoidal displacing the bottom surface of the geometrical model. Large eddy simulation with dynamic sub-grid scale model is adopted for modeling the turbulent flow via a commercial CFD software, Converge. This study has found that (1) the secondary vortices in the mouth cavity are much more complex considering the lung expansion than setting the quasi-steady inspiration flow at the mouth-inlet; (2) the properties of secondary vortices in the trachea are not evidently different at the same Reynolds number at the accelerating and decelerating inspiration phases; (3) the reversed pharynx jet as well as recirculation zone is much unsteadier at the accelerating expiration phase than decelerating expiration phase for the same Reynolds number. We conclude that the properties of airflow structures are highly impacted by the respiration pattern and more investigations should be conducted, particularly, on the airflow structures during expiration phase for further understanding the properties of flow field.",Large eddy simulation; Unsteady respiratory pattern; Airflow structures,"Cui, XG; Wu, WW; Ge, HW",2020.0,Journal,RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY,10.1016/j.resp.2020.103468,"[Cui, Xinguang] Huazhong Sci & Technol Univ, Sch Aerosp Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wenwang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Engn Mech, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ge, Haiwen] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",ELSEVIER,English,1569-9048,
WoS,Improved bacterial RNA-seq by Cas9-based depletion of ribosomal RNA reads,"A major challenge for RNA-seq analysis of gene expression is to achieve sufficient coverage of informative nonribosomal transcripts. In eukaryotic samples, this is typically achieved by selective oligo(dT)-priming of messenger RNAs to exclude ribosomal RNA(rRNA) during cDNA synthesis. However, this strategy is not compatible with prokaryotes in which functional transcripts are generally not polyadenylated. To overcome this, we adopted DASH (depletion of abundant sequences by hybridization), initially developed for eukaryotic cells, to improve both the sensitivity and depth of bacterial RNA-seq. DASH uses the Cas9 nuclease to remove unwanted cDNA sequences prior to library amplification. We report the design, evaluation, and optimization of DASH experiments for standard bacterial short-read sequencing approaches, including software for automated guide RNA (gRNA) design for Cas9-mediated cleavage in bacterial rDNA sequences. Using these gRNA pools, we effectively removed rRNA reads (56%-86%) in RNA-seq libraries from two different model bacteria, the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella enterica and the anaerobic gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. DASH works robustly, even with subnanogram amounts of input RNA. Its efficiency, high sensitivity, ease of implementation, and low cost (similar to$5 per sample) render DASH an attractive alternative to rRNA removal protocols, in particular for material-constrained studies where conventional ribodepletion techniques fail.",bacterial RNA-seq; DASH; ribosomal RNA; Cas9; CRISPR; Salmonella; Bacteroides,"Prezza, G; Heckel, T; Dietrich, S; Homberger, C; Westermann, AJ; Vogel, J",2020.0,Journal,RNA,10.1261/rna.075945.120,"[Prezza, Gianluca; Homberger, Christina; Westermann, Alexander J.; Vogel, Jorg] Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res HZI, Helmholtz Inst RNA Based Infect Res HIRI, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Heckel, Tobias; Dietrich, Sascha] Univ Wurzburg, Core Unit Syst Med, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Westermann, Alexander J.; Vogel, Jorg] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Mol Infect Biol IMIB, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany","COLD SPRING HARBOR LAB PRESS, PUBLICATIONS DEPT",English,1355-8382,
WoS,Check updates Original Optimization and techno-economic assessment of concentrated solar power (CSP) in South-Western Africa: A case study on Ghana,"The techno-economic performance of two different CSP technologies i.e. Solar tower (ST) and parabolic trough (PT) were evaluated in this paper, each at two different locations in Ghana (Navrongo and Tamale) using the System Advisor Model (SAM) software. From the simulated results, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of 13.67 cent/ kWh and 14.73 cent/kWh were recorded for the ST modelled at Navrongo and Tamale, respectively. The PT power plant simulated at Tamale and Navrongo also recorded an LCOE of 28.83 cent/kWh and 25.83 cent/kWh, respectively. It was observed that, the optimum solar multiple (SM) for the ST ranges between 1.4 and 1.9, this is because the least LCOEs for the different thermal energy storage (TES) periods are within that range. In the case of the PT power plants, the SM also depends on the period of the TES and each TES has a distinct SM ranging between 2.4 and 4. Results from the analysis suggests that the ST technology is the optimal system for the Ghanaian weather conditions. The study concludes that the bankability of CSP technology in Ghana depends on the type of financial conditions for the project. Therefore, appropriate policies from government are necessary to help in their development.",Concentrated solar power; Solar tower; Parabolic trough; Solar multiple; Ghana,"Agyekum, EB; Velkin, VI",2020.0,Journal,SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS,10.1016/j.seta.2020.100763,"[Agyekum, Ephraim Bonah; Velkin, Vladimir Ivanovich] Ural Fed Univ, Dept Nucl & Renewable Energy, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",ELSEVIER,English,2213-1388,
WoS,Day-ahead scheduling problem of smart micro-grid with high penetration of wind energy and demand side management strategies,"In this paper, the day-ahead scheduling problem of a smart microgrid (SMG) is modeled as a multi-objective function consisting of: i) minimizing the operation cost and the emission pollution in generation side ii) minimizing the load curtailment cost with the strategic conversion of curtailable loads (CLs) and iii) coordinating of shiftable loads (SLs) and the output power of wind turbines (WTs). The second and the third objectives present a new approach of Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies to improve the customer's satisfaction (CS) and the WT penetration (WTP) using stimulation of customers to use their loads regarding the demand profile of the system. Also, the output power of WTs is considered as the stochastic model, and the participation of the SLs based on the availability of WTs output power are scheduled. To confirm the proposed approach, all objective functions are optimized by the epsilon-constraint approach in the GAMS optimization software and the best solution of the non-dominated Pareto solutions is selected using the decision-making method. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model, it is applied on a 24-node microgrid through four case studies.",Demand Side Management (DSM); WT penetration; Optimal coordination; epsilon-constraint method; Decision-making method,"Chamandoust, H; Bahramara, S; Derakhshan, G",2020.0,Journal,SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS,10.1016/j.seta.2020.100747,"[Chamandoust, Heydar; Derakhshan, Ghasem] Islamic Azad Univ, Damavand Branch, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Bahramara, Salah] Islamic Azad Univ, Sanandaj Branch, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran",ELSEVIER,English,2213-1388,
WoS,Design and simulation of a new cascaded ammonia synthesis system driven by renewables,"This study proposes a new configuration for synthesizing clean ammonia using clean hydrogen produced by the renewables. The proposed system mainly consists of proton exchange membrane electrolyser, pressure swing adsorption unit, compressor, ammonia synthesis reactors and condenser. The designed configuration uses a cascaded approach for ammonia synthesis by employing two reactors in series to achieve high conversion ratios and to reduce the recycle loops. The proposed system is simulated using industrial software Aspen Plus V11 and Aspen adsorption V11 and the obtained results are discussed in detail. The designed system is investigated under different operating conditions. In the Aspen Plus simulation, both stoichiometric and Gibbs reactors are installed alternatively to investigate the ammonia synthesis process in depths and to establish the effect of temperature and pressure on the ammonia production capacities. The maximum exergy destruction rate of 65.43 kW is of-fered by the primary ammonia synthesis reactor. The energetic efficiency of the clean ammonia synthesis system is found to be 61.14% and exergetic efficiency is 65.5%.

WoS,Proposal and assessment of a new integrated liquefied natural gas generation process with auto - Cascade refrigeration (exergy and economic analyses),"The main objective of this study is to propose a novel Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) production process using the auto - cascade refrigeration as the pre-cooling system. This auto - cascade system operates as stand-alone (without external electricity), and can supply the refrigeration temperature of -54.62 degrees C, which can decrease the total electricity consumption of the process. The Aspen HYSYS V11 software is employed for simulation of this hybrid process. Based on the energy analysis, this integrated process can produce 31.71 kg/s LNG by consuming the specific power of 0.189 kWh/kg LNG. In order to evaluate the system technically, the exergy analysis is implemented for each subunit and the whole process. The outcomes of exergy evaluation depicted that the overall exergy efficiency and overall destroyed exergy rate are 91.68% and 67688 kW, respectively. Also, about 77.3% of the overall irreversibility occurred in the heat exchangers. The economic aspect of this process is evaluated by the Annualized Cost of System (ACS) method. Based on the outcomes of economic assessment, the annualized cost and prime cost of product are accounted for 182.6 MMUS$/year and 0.1959 US$/kg LNG, respectively. In continue, the technical and economic outputs of the proposed configuration are compared to the previous investigations. It was found that by utilizing the auto - cascade refrigeration system as the precooling system of LNG production, the required power and primary costs for producing LNG are considerably reduced. Finally, in order to specify the effects of economic factors on the electricity price, the sensitivity analysis is implemented. Furthermore, the influence of turbine inlet pressure on the efficiency of the hybrid process is investigated.",LNG production; Auto - cascade refrigeration system; Absorption refrigeration cycle; Dual mixed refrigerant; Exergy analysis; Economic analysis,"Mehrpooya, M; Ghorbani, B; Mousavi, SA; Zaitsev, A",2020.0,Journal,SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS,10.1016/j.seta.2020.100728,"[Mehrpooya, Mehdi; Zaitsev, Andrew] ITMO Univ, Fac Cryogen Engn, Sch Biotechnol & Cryogen Syst, St Petersburg, Russia; [Ghorbani, Bahram] Amol Univ Special Modern Technol, Fac Engn Modern Technol, Amol, Iran; [Mousavi, Seyed Ali] Univ Tehran, Fac New Sci & Technol, Renewable Energies & Environm Dept, Tehran, Iran",ELSEVIER,English,2213-1388,

We present a list of quick dos and don'ts for both tables and figures. Investigators should feel free to break any of the guidelines if it would result in a beautiful figure or a clear table that communicates data effectively.

WoS,Inbreeding Between Deep-sea Snailfishes Careproctus pellucidus and Careproctus rastrinus in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean,"Genetic deviation between two deep-sea snailfishes, Careproctus pellucidus from the Pacific Ocean and Careproctus rastrinus from the Okhotsk Sea, of the Careproctus rastrinus species complex was analyzed, based on the nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) gene. Our sampling revealed the occurrence of individuals with C. rastrinus-type Cytb genes off northeastern Japan, in the northwestern Pacific. Most of these individuals were collected from an area off Miyagi Prefecture, while few individuals were collected from areas to its north (off Iwate Prefecture) and south (off Fukushima and Ibaraki Prefectures). Phylogeographic analyses based on nucleotide sequences of the first intron region of the nuclear S7 ribosomal protein gene (S7) and 11 microsatellite loci indicated little genetic deviation between individuals with C. pellucidus-type and C. rastrinus-type Cytb genes in the area off Miyagi Prefecture. Significant genetic differences between the Pacific Ocean and the Okhotsk Sea populations may be attributed to unidirectional migration due to a greater current from the latter to the former. In addition, peritoneum and stomach colors of 10 and 17 specimens collected from the Pacific Ocean and the Okhotsk Sea, respectively, were evaluated quantitatively. The colors were significantly different for the two populations; however, they appeared to overlap. Although only one Pacific individual with a C. rastrinus-type Cytb gene was available for color evaluation, it was more similar to Pacific individuals than to Okhotsk Sea individuals.

WoS,Validation of semi-automated flow-mediated dilation measurement in healthy volunteers,"Background Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is a non-invasive imaging modality used to measure endothelial function but has significant intra- and inter-observer variability. The use of semi-automated FMD devices could overcome this limitation. We assessed the reproducibility of same-day semi-automated FMD measurements by investigators who received basic training on the correct use of the device. Methods Forty-three healthy volunteers had two brachial artery FMD measurements performed 20 minutes apart using the UNEX EF 38G device, and automated outputs were produced. Images were also manually analysed using edge-detection software. The reproducibility of repeat FMD measurements within individuals was compared for automated and manual readings, and the correlation between analytical techniques was calculated. Results Twenty-five percent of scans were of non-diagnostic quality (n = 32). Automated analyses demonstrated sub-optimal reproducibility and measurement variability [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICCC) = 0.334, coefficient of variation (CV) = 45.87%]. In contrast, manually analysed scans had excellent reproducibility and low measurement variance (ICCC = 0.815, CV = 11.40%). FMD values obtained from automated and manual analysis correlated poorly (r = 0.164), whereas resting (r = 0.955) and maximal brachial artery diameters demonstrated excellent correlation (r = 0.867). Conclusion Manually evaluated serial UNEX EF readings have good reproducibility and therefore, the optimal FMD workflow involves manual analyses prior to independent automated interrogation. The high non-diagnostic scan rate is most likely the result of insufficient training and indicates that semi-automatic devices such as UNEX EF should be used by experienced investigators to achieve optimal results.(C) 2020 The Author(s).

WoS,An Evaluation Framework for Comparative Analysis of Generalized Stochastic Petri Net Simulation Techniques,"Availability of a common, shared benchmark to provide repeatable, quantifiable, and comparable results is an added value for any scientific community. International consortia provide benchmarks in a wide range of domains, being normally used by industry, vendors, and researchers for evaluating their software products. In this regard, a benchmark of untimed Petri net models was developed to be used in a yearly software competition driven by the Petri net community. However, to the best of our knowledge there is not a similar benchmark to evaluate solution techniques for Petri nets with timing extensions. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for the comparative analysis of generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPNs) simulation techniques. Although we focus on simulation techniques, our framework provides a baseline for a comparative analysis of different GSPN solvers (e.g., simulators, numerical solvers, or other techniques). The evaluation framework encompasses a set of 50 GSPN models including test cases and case studies from the literature, and a set of evaluation guidelines for the comparative analysis. In order to show the applicability of the proposed framework, we carry out a comparative analysis of steady-state simulators implemented in three academic software tools, namely, GreatSPN, PeabraiN, and TimeNET.

WoS,Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on sleep quality and mental health for insomnia patients: A meta-analysis,"Objective: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a potentially effective supplement for the treatment of insomnia; however, there is no comprehensive review of its mental health effects among insomnia patients. This study aimed to synthesize relevant quantitative evidence and evaluate MBSR application and effectiveness for insomnia patients' sleep quality and mental health. Methods: A systematic search through eight databases from the earliest available dates until August 2019 was conducted. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of MBSR on sleep quality, anxiety, and depression as outcome measures among insomnia patients comprising patients aged above 18 years were included in this meta-analysis. Each study's quality was assessed using the modified Jadad quality scale. The Review Manager 5.3 software was used to calculate the standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the data analyses. Results: In total, data for 497 patients in seven randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The results revealed that compared to the control group, the MBSR group significantly improved in sleep quality (SMD = -0.69, 95% CI: -1.12 similar to - 0.26, Z = 3.16, p = .002), depression (SMD = -1.83, 95% CI: -2.81-0.84, Z = 3.63, p < .001), and anxiety (SMD = -1.74, 95% CI: -2.90-0.59, Z = 2.96, p = .003). A sensitivity analysis was undertaken. After carefully reviewing included trials, we can reasonably conclude that these heterogeneities did not impair the overall effect size of MBSR in the results. Conclusions: MBSR significantly improved sleep quality and mental health. Future research is needed using standardized methods examining the long-term effects of MBSR on the mental health of individuals with insomnia.",Insomnia; MBSR; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Sleep quality,"Chen, TL; Chang, SC; Hsieh, HF; Huang, CY; Chuang, JH; Wang, HH",2020.0,Review,JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110144,"[Chen, Tsai-Ling; Hsieh, Hsiu-Fen; Wang, Hsiu-Hung] Kaohsiung Med Univ, Coll Nursing, 4F First Teaching Bldg,Shin Chuan 1st Rd, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan; [Chang, Shu-Chen] Changhua Christian Hosp, Dept Nursing, Changhua, Taiwan; [Huang, Chin-Yi] Changhua Christian Hosp, Res Dept, Changhua, Taiwan; [Chuang, Jui-Hsiang] Luckang Christian Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Changhua, Taiwan",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0022-3999,
WoS,Time-dependent 3D modeling of the thermal analysis of the high-power diode laser hardening process,"In this paper, the thermal analysis of the high-power diode laser hardening process was modeled on AISI 4130 steel. Afterward, the depth and width of hardness were predicted based on the complete austenite temperature (AC(3)). Due to the dimensions and output beam power of the diode laser stack (DLS), it is impossible to achieve the suitable power density (10(3)-10(5) W/cm(2)). Furthermore, the output intensity profile of the DLS is not homogeneous because of the pitch between the emitters. Thus, to achieve a suitable power density and a uniform beam profile, an optical layout was designed. The beam profile was experimentally obtained by a beam profiler at different distances from the focal plane and was compared with the modeling results. Due to the agreement between the modeling and experimental results, the intensity value of each mesh of the laser profile was extracted from the ZEMAX software. Then, for the thermal analysis of the laser hardening process (LHP), it was entered as a heat flux input into the COMSOL Multiphysics software.",Complete austenite temperature; High power diode laser; Intensity profile; Laser hardening; Thermal analysis,"Alikhani, ST; Zahabi, MK; Torkamany, MJ; Nabavi, SH",2020.0,Journal,OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.optlastec.2020.106216,"[Alikhani, Saeed Talesh; Zahabi, Mohammad Kazemi; Torkamany, Mohammad Javad; Nabavi, Seyed Hasan] Iranian Natl Ctr Laser Sci & Technol, POB 14665-576, Tehran, Iran",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0030-3992,
WoS,Influence of Plasma Transfer Arc Cladding of NiCrBFe filler powder on microstructure and tensile properties of Titanium Grade 2 and Ti 6Al-4V alloy dissimilar joint prepared by laser beam welding,"The present investigation deals with the effect of Plasma Transfer Arc Cladding (PTAC) of 60%Ni30%CrB10%Fe filler powder on microstructure and tensile properties of Titanium Grade 2 and Ti 6Al-4V alloy dissimilar joint done by laser beam welding. In laser beam welding, full depth of penetration was achieved using the laser beam power of 1300 W, welding speed of 200 mm/min and focus distance of 10 mm. Tensile studies showed that all the failures occurred in the fusion zones of as-welded, dissimilar weldments and PTAC coated samples. Failure analysis was performed using Comsol software and the results were obsersed as well-in accordance with the experimental results. Finite element studies showed the better accuracy results while comparing both experiemental and simulation results. The microstructure and mechanical properties studies were conducted on as-welded, dissimilar weldments and PTAC coated samples by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) respectively. XRD displayed the slight presence of compressive residual stress in PTAC coated samples. The microstrcture studies conducted at the fusion zone revealed that more amount of coarse grain boundaries were converted into alpha-Fe. The avearge heat inputs (Hi) were applied in the coated samples that converted the alpha + beta phase structure into TiNi + TiCrFe boundarys. PTAC coated samples showed the average hardness value of 313 HV and dissimilar weldments exhibited the hardness value of 290 HV. The present study concluded that the corrosion resistance of coated materials was improved owing to the better tensile and bending strength of material.",Laser beam welding; Plasma Transfer Arc Cladding; NiCrBFe filler powder; Finite element analysis; Mechanical Properties,"Prasath, NE; Selvabharathi, R",2020.0,Journal,OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.optlastec.2020.106206,"[Selvabharathi, R.] Sethu Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Kariapatti 626115, Tamil Nadu, India; [Prasath, N.

WoS,CGI based syslog management system for virtual machines,"Undoubtedly, logs are brain of any software system. Development, debugging and upgradation of software applications became much easier due to the logging or auditing concept in computer science field. Virtual Machines also log and timestamp every activity that take place during their runtime. Gathering system details from those lengthy log files is a hectic work for the end-user since single log file contains millennial entries of audited log data. A management system can be very helpful solution and required for the analytical scanning and the visualization of the logged data and thus providing the way to end user for the relevant information about the virtual machines running on the hypervisors. The same system can help developers to gather relevant log entries and presenting data collectively to the end user. This system not only helps in providing and presenting details but also act as an alert system to notify user fatal errors occurred during runtime. Statistical usage information or notification system can further be developed by the means of this syslog system. This paper will present how developers can build an efficient Syslog Management System on the web using the (CGI) Common Gateway Interface in the C programming language and also mentions how CGI environment can be achieved in the Apache Tomcat webserver to build dynamic web tools. Also, it provides basic idea how C can be used effectively in the CGI interface to provide better methods for obtaining and extracting relevant system data.",Apache Tomcat; CGI; Cloud; Log; Syslog; Virtual machines,"Dua, K; Choudhury, T; Rajanikanth, U; Choudhury, A",2020.0,Journal,SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH,10.1007/s41324-019-00308-7,"[Dua, Kamal; Choudhury, Tanupriya; Rajanikanth, Uppara; Choudhury, Amitava] Univ Petr & Energy Studies UPES, Sch Comp Sci, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India",SPRINGER SINGAPORE PTE LTD,English,2366-3286,
WoS,Prediction of the Depth of Tumor Invasion in Gastric Cancer: Potential Role of CT Radiomics,"Rationale and Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the value of computed tomography (CT) radiomics for the differentiation between T2 and T3/4 stage lesions in gastric cancer. Materials and methods: A total of 244 consecutive patients with pathologically proven gastric cancer were retrospectively included and split into a training cohort (171 patients) and a test cohort (73 patients). Preoperative arterial phase and portal phase contrast enhanced CT images were retrieved for tumor segmentation and feature extraction by using a dedicated postprocessing software. The random forest method was used to build the classifier models. Results: The performance of single phase radiomics models were favorable in the differentiation between T2 and T3/4 stage tumors. Arterial phase-based radiomics model exhibited areas under the curve of 0.899 (95% CI: 0.812-0.955) in the training cohort and 0.825 (95% CI: 0.718-0.904) in the test cohort. Portal phase-based radiomics model showed areas under the curve of 0.843 (95% CI: 0.746-0.914) and 0.818 (95% CI: 0.711-0.899) in the training and test cohort, respectively.

WoS,Template Creation for High-Resolution Computed Tomography Scans of the Lung in R Software,"Rationale and Objectives: A standard lung template could improve population-level analyses for computed tomography (CT) scans of the lung. We develop a fully automated preprocessing pipeline for image analysis of the lungs using updated methodologies and R software that results in the creation of a standard lung template. We apply this pipeline to CT scans from a sarcoidosis population, exploring the influence of registration on radiomic analyses. Materials and Methods: Using 65 high-resolution CT scans from healthy adults, we create a standard lung template by segmenting the left and right lungs, nonlinearly registering lung masks to an initial template mask, and using an unbiased, iterative procedure to converge to a standard lung shape (Dice similarity coefficient >= 0.99). We compare three-dimensional radiomic features between control and sarcoidosis patients, before and after registration to a study-specific lung template. Results: The final lung template had a right lung volume of 2967 cm(3) and left lung volume of 2623 cm(3), with a median HU = -862. Registration significantly affected radiomic features, shifting the HU distribution to the left, decreasing variability, and increasing smoothness (p < 0.0001). The registration improved detective ability of radiomics; for contrast, autocorrelation, energy, and homogeneity, the group effect was significant postregistration (p < 0.05), but was not significant preregistration. Conclusion: The final lung template and software used for its creation are publicly available via the lungct R package to facilitate its use in practice. This study advances lung imaging by developing tools to improve population-level analyses for various lung diseases. (C) 2019 The Association of University Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

WoS,Development of an Automated Algorithm to Generate Guideline-based Recommendations for Follow-up Colonoscopy,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physician adherence to published colonoscopy surveillance guidelines varies. We aimed to develop and validate an automated clinical decision support algorithm that can extract procedure and pathology data from the electronic medical record (EMR) and generate surveillance intervals congruent with guidelines, which might increase physician adherence. METHODS: We constructed a clinical decision support (CDS) algorithm based on guidelines from the United States Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer. We used a randomly generated validation dataset of 300 outpatient colonoscopies performed at the Cleveland Clinic from 2012 through 2016 to evaluate the accuracy of extracting data from reports stored in the EMR using natural language processing (NLP). We compared colonoscopy follow-up recommendations from the CDS algorithm, endoscopists, and task force guidelines. Using a testing dataset of 2439 colonoscopies, we compared endoscopist recommendations with those of the algorithm. RESULTS: Manual review of the validation dataset confirmed the NLP program accurately extracted procedure and pathology data for all cases. Recommendations made by endoscopists and the CDS algorithm were guideline-concordant in 62% and 99% of cases, respectively. Discrepant recommendations by endoscopists were earlier than recommended in 94% of the cases. In the testing dataset, 69% of endoscopist and NLP-CDS algorithm recommendations were concordant. Discrepant recommendations by endoscopists were earlier than guidelines in 91% of cases.

WoS,"High-Throughput, Machine Learning-Based Quantification of Steatosis, Inflammation, Ballooning, and Fibrosis in Biopsies From Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Liver biopsy is the reference standard for staging and grading nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but histologic scoring systems are semiquantitative with marked interobserver and intraobserver variation. We used machine learning to develop fully automated software for quantification of steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis in biopsy specimens from patients with NAFLD and validated the technology in a separate group of patients. METHODS: We collected data from 246 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and followed up in London from January 2010 through December 2016. Biopsy specimens from the first 100 patients were used to derive the algorithm and biopsy specimens from the following 146 were used to validate it. Biopsy specimens were scored independently by pathologists using the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network criteria and digitalized. Areas of steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis were annotated on biopsy specimens by 2 hepatobiliary histopathologists to facilitate machine learning. Images of biopsies from the derivation and validation sets then were analyzed by the algorithm to compute percentages of fat, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis, as well as the collagen proportionate area, and compared with findings from pathologists' manual annotations and conventional scoring systems. RESULTS: In the derivation group, results from manual annotation and the software had an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.97 for steatosis (95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P<.001); ICC of 0.96 for inflammation (95% CI, 0.9-0.98; P<.001); ICC of 0.94 for ballooning (95% CI, 0.87-0.98; P<.001); and ICC of 0.92 for fibrosis (95% CI, 0.88-0.96; P=.001). Percentages of fat, inflammation, ballooning, and the collagen proportionate area from the derivation group were confirmed in the validation cohort. The software identified histologic features of NAFLD with levels of interobserver and intraobserver agreement ranging from 0.95 to 0.99; this value was higher than that of semiquantitative scoring systems, which ranged from 0.58 to 0.88. In a subgroup of paired liver biopsy specimens, quantitative analysis was more sensitive in detecting differences compared with the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: We used machine learning to develop software to rapidly and objectively analyze liver biopsy specimens for histologic features of NAFLD. The results from the software correlate with those from histopathologists, with high levels of interobserver and intraobserver agreement. Findings were validated in a separate group of patients.

WoS,"Survivorship in immune therapy: Assessing toxicities, body composition and health-related quality of life among long-term survivors treated with antibodies to programmed death-1 receptor and its ligand","Aim: Antibodies to programmed death-1 receptor and its ligand (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) produce durable responses in many cancers. However, the long-term effects of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade are not well defined. We identified the toxicities, health outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) amongst long-term survivors treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Methods: We assessed 217 patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 for melanoma, renal cell carcinoma or non-small-cell lung carcinoma between 2009 and 2017, with survival greater than two years after treatment. Patient and tumour characteristics, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), cardiometabolic parameters (glucose, blood pressure, body mass index [BMI]), body composition (using automated body composition analyser, computed tomography and Slice-o-matic software) and HRQoL outcomes were tracked. Results: Among the included patients, most were men (70.3%) and at anti-PD-1/PD-L1 initiation had an average age of 61.0 years and median BMI of 28.5. Median overall survival was not reached; 33 (15.2%) died during the follow-up primarily from progressive cancer (n = 28). At the last follow-up, most patients' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 (38%) or 1 (41%). There was no difference in blood pressure, glucose or BMI from baseline to two years after treatment initiation. Body composition showed increased adiposity (p = 0.05), skeletal muscle mass (p = 0.03) and skeletal muscle gauge (p = 0.04). We observed chronic irAEs at the last follow-up including hypothyroidism (10.6%), arthritis (3.2%), adrenal insufficiency (3.2%) and neuropathy (2.8%). New diagnoses of type 2 diabetes (6.5%) and hypertension (6.0%) were observed, with uncertain relationship to anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Patient-reported outcomes compared favourably with cancer and general populations, although younger age (p = 0.003) and need for subsequent therapy (p = 0.03) were associated with worse HRQoL outcomes. Conclusion: Durable responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and favourable HRQoL outcomes are encouraging. Chronic events may be more common than previously thought although no clear chronic adverse cardiometabolic effects were observed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Digital assessment of a retentive full crown preparation-An evaluation of prepCheck in an undergraduate pre-clinical teaching environment,"Introduction Acquiring practical skills is essential for dental students. These practical skills are assessed throughout their training, both formatively and summatively. However, by means of visual inspection alone, assessment cannot always be performed objectively. A computerised evaluation system may serve as an objective tool to assist the assessor. Aim The aim of the study was to evaluate prepCheck as a tool to assess students' practical skills and as a means to provide feedback in dental education. Methods As part of a previously scheduled practical examination, students made a preparation for a retentive crown on the maxillary right central incisor-tooth 11. Assessments were made four times by two independent assessors in two different ways: (a) conventionally and (b) assisted by prepCheck. By means of Cohen's kappa coefficient, agreements between conventional and digitally assisted assessments were compared. Questionnaires were used to assess how students experienced working with prepCheck. Results Without the use of prepCheck, ratings given by teachers differed considerably (mean kappa = 0.19), whereas the differences with prepCheck assistance were very small (mean kappa = 0.96). Students found prepCheck a helpful tool for teachers to assess practical skills. Extra feedback given by prepCheck was considered useful and effective. However, some students complained about too few scanners and too little time for practice, and some believed that prepCheck is too strict. Conclusion prepCheck can be used to assist assessors in order to obtain a more objective outcome. Results showed that practicing with feedback from both prepCheck and the teacher contributes to an effective learning process. Most students appreciated prepCheck for learning practical skills, but introducing prepCheck requires enough equipment and preparation time.",assessment software; digital assessment; prepCheck,"Schepke, U; Palthe, MEV; Meisberger, EW; Kerdijk, W; Cune, MS; Blok, B",2020.0,Journal,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION,10.1111/eje.12516,"[Schepke, Ulf; van Wulfften Palthe, Mariette E.; Meisberger, Eric W.; Cune, Marco S.; Blok, Berend] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Ctr Dent & Oral Hyg, Dept Restorat Dent & Biomat, Groningen, Netherlands; [Kerdijk, Wouter] Hanze Univ Appl Sci, Dept Educ & Res, Groningen, Netherlands; [Cune, Marco S.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg Prosthodont & Spec, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Cune, Marco S.] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg Prosthodont & Spec, Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Cune, Marco S.] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, St Antonius Hosp, Nieuwegein, Netherlands",WILEY,English,1396-5883,

WoS,Detecting Spatial Cores and Temporal Trends of Repeat STIs to Plan Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Scale-up in DC,"Background: Repeat sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in DC primarily results from untreated sexual partners. This analysis aims to identify high-risk areas and temporal trends of repeat STIs for pre-exposure prophylaxis scale-up and STI mitigation in DC. Methods: We identified repeat infections in the DC Department of Health STI and HIV data management systems, diagnosed from 2014 to 2018. The cases were geocoded and aggregated by census tracts. Poisson discrete scan statistic was implemented in SaTScan software to find clusters. Weighted moving average was used to compare temporal trends of repeat STIs. We used chi(2)analysis to identify association with demographic variables. Results: We identified 8535 repeat STIs from 2014 to 2018. Of these, 61.84% were among men, most cases were among blacks (34.75%) and 47.45% represented gonorrhea cases. The high-risk spatial clusters were identified as those tracts that had relative risk (relative risk > 1;P-value < 0.001). We identified one significant radius of risk covering tracts of wards 7 and 8 and parts of wards 5 and 6. We spotted positive temporal trends in cluster 1 and outside the cluster. We found significant associations of repeat STIs with gender (chi(2)= 317.27,P< 0.001), age (chi(2)= 539.26,P< 0.001), HIV coinfections (chi(2)= 352.06,P< 0.001), and year of diagnoses (chi(2)= 1.5,P< 0.01).

WoS,Visualization Technology and Tool Selection Methods for Solving Adaptive Training Complex Structural-Parametric Synthesis Problems,"Our previous work in the field of formalization, modeling, and design of adaptive training complexes (ATCs) revealed the low accuracy of the traditional expert approach to selecting ATC components. The study addresses the practical scientific problem of classifying and selecting visualization tools and technologies for designing ATC. Currently, this is done using highly subjective expert evaluation. Therefore, we develop a methodology for the selection of visualization tools and technologies to reduce the influence of the human factor by applying a set of main criteria for visualization component evaluation. Classification is based on the facet approach. We create an original technique that allows users to formalize the main objects of a technical system needing a training complex. It allows users to correlate these aspects to the visualization components and to group, evaluate, and rank them. Integration time, use-cost and component visualization quality, training quality, and time are important variables in the methodology. The use of lexicographic optimization methods or linear convolution of criteria is proposed to obtain an optimal solution from the final Pareto-set. The proposed component selection method has several advantages, compared with the classical approach: greater objectivity of the obtained estimates, better development, and further software implementation automation. Thus, this method addressed the problem of choosing the components of ATC visualization.

WoS,Combinatorial meta-heuristics approaches for DVFS-enabled green clouds,"Many scientific applications used in decision support systems successfully make use of nature-based resourceful techniques. The advancements being made in successfully mimicking nature are laying the path for designing energy-efficient clouds. Two meta-heuristic techniques including ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization, in combination with Bayesian and fuzzy approach, are proposed to be used in this research for designing an energy-efficient cloud system, which adopts the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) method. As DVFS is increasingly becoming an industry standard owing to its incorporation into the CPU hardware, appropriate software-oriented approaches are essential to calibrate the current methodologies.

WoS,Detection of heartbeat sounds arrhythmia using automatic spectral methods and cardiac auscultatory,"Auscultation, the listening process for lung sound using acoustic stethoscope, is the first physical examination used to detect any disorder in heartbeat system. Unlike sophisticated tools, stethoscope is not beyond the reach of rural hospitals and clinics. However, the use of acoustic stethoscope needs specialized and well-experienced physicians. This is mainly due to limited sound amplification of the stethoscope to the extent that the human ears may fail to recognize the pathological sound, and hence, the diagnosis may be erroneously classified. Models that make use of screened digital, instead of acoustic, stethoscope, in which heart sound is digitized and stored, becomes one of the most popular techniques because it allows computer-aided software to perform automated analysis. In this paper, a complete algorithm for automatic heartbeat detection and disorder discrimination is presented. The technique takes the advantage of spectral analysis to separate the first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) using a power threshold. The frame duration is dynamically estimated, according to duration of the sound to be analyzed (S1 or S2). As typical recordings of heart sounds are periodic with several cycles, two methods to combine MFCC estimates are proposed. Using 450 cardiac ausculatory with both pathological and normal heartbeats, the proposed methods were examined using a cross-validation strategy based on tenfold. More than 90%, at best, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were obtained for the two methods using an artificial neural network classifier with multilayer perceptron. The solution takes the advantage of recent technology and digital advances, in which it is possible to connect the digital stethoscope to any digital device to conduct further analysis using computer-aided applications. The technique is practical as it can be available at different hospitals and clinics, including those in rural areas, with limited resources.",Heartbeat Sounds; Pathological; Automatic spectral methods; Cardiac auscultatory,"Mustafa, M; Abdalla, GMT; Manimurugan, S; Alharbi, AR",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING,10.1007/s11227-019-03062-7,"[Mustafa, Mohammed] Univ Tabuk, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Tabuk City, Saudi Arabia; [Abdalla, G.

WoS,Nonparametric dynamically weighted combination model to determine when to stop testing,"Software manufacturers need to minimize the number of their software failures in their production environments. So, software reliability becomes a critical factor for these manufacturers to focus on. Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs) are used as indicators of the number of failures that may be faced after the shipping of the software and thus are indicators of the readiness of the software for shipping. SRGMs to handle varying operational profiles have been proposed by researchers earlier. However, as it is difficult to predict the nature of the project in advance, the reliability engineer has to try out each model one at a time before zeroing in on the model to be used in the project.

WoS,Detecting removed attributes in the cyber system for smart manufacturing,"According to the concept of edge computing, some service and data should be moved from the centralized data server to the data source for enhancing the computational efficiency especially for real-time applications, e.g., production monitoring. In the manufacturing industries, most of the data sources are equipment. Deploying the application programming interface (API) services near the data source is the common solution. However, keeping the consistency of the production configuration between API servers and the manufacturing data center with minimum resource is a critical problem in terms of the computational efficiency and the speed of response. In this paper, we propose the partition and pass (PnP) mechanism to synchronize the production line settings saved in the API servers with that in the data center. From the analysis results, we show that the approximation ratio is 2 compared with current solutions including the time-based approach and the counter-based approach. It means that the proposed PnP only needs one half computing cost to finish the same number of products with that required by current solutions. Based on the simulation results, the PnP only requires 31% computation time to finish the synchronization process which matches the analysis results. Moreover, we provide a case study to show that the proposed PnP captures more events than current solutions. In other words, applying PnP in the production line will increase the computation performance to synchronize the production configuration between API servers and data center in saving manufacturing data.",Smart manufacturing; Software-defined technology; Cloud service; Data synchronization,"Yen, CT; Tsung, CK; Wu, WF",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING,10.1007/s11227-019-02809-6,"[Yen, Chun-Tai; Wu, Wen-Fang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ind Engn, Room 517,Coll Engn Bldg,30,Sec 3,Xinhai Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Tsung, Chen-Kun] Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Room E534,57,Sec 2,Zhongshan Rd, Taichung 41170, Taiwan",SPRINGER,English,0920-8542,

WoS,Usability feature extraction using modified crow search algorithm: a novel approach,"For the purpose of usability feature extraction and prediction, an innovative metaheuristic algorithm is introduced. Generally, the term usability is defined by the several researchers with respect to the hierarchical-based software usability model and it has become one of the important methods in terms of software quality. In hierarchically based software, its usability factors, attributes, and its characteristics are combined. The paper presented an algorithm, i.e., modified crow search algorithm (MCSA) mainly for extraction of usability features from hierarchical model with the optimal solution under the search for useful features. MCSA is an extension of original crow search algorithm (CSA), which is a naturally inspired algorithm. The mechanism of this algorithm is based on the process of hiding food and prevents theft and hence introduced this CSA in the field of software engineering practices as an inspiration. The algorithm generates a particular number of selected features/attributes and is applied on software development life cycles models, finding out the best among them. The results of the presented algorithm are compared with the standard binary bat algorithm (BBA), original CSA, and modified whale optimization algorithm (MWOA). The outcomes conclude that the proposed MCSA performs well than the standard BBA and original CSA as the proposed algorithms generate fewer number of feature selection equal to 17 than 18 in BBA, 23 in CSA, and 19 in MWOA.",Crow search algorithm; Modified crow search algorithm; Software quality; Feature extraction; HCI,"Gupta, D; Rodrigues, JJPC; Sundaram, S; Khanna, A; Korotaev, V; de Albuquerque, VHC",2020.0,Journal,NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS,10.1007/s00521-018-3688-6,"[Gupta, Deepak; Sundaram, Shirsh; Khanna, Ashish] Maharaja Agrasen Inst Technol, Delhi, India; [Gupta, Deepak; Rodrigues, Joel J.

WoS,A new EEG software that supports emotion recognition by using an autonomous approach,"Human behavior is manly addressed by emotions. One of the most accepted models that represent emotions is known as the circumplex model. This model organizes emotions into points on a bidimensional plane: valence and arousal. Despite the importance of the emotion recognition, there are limited initiatives that seek to classify emotions easily in an uncontrolled environment. In this work, we present the architecture and the design of an extensible software which allows recognizing and classifying emotions by using a low-cost EEG. The proposed software implements an emotion classifier although a support vector machines (SVM) are boosted with an autonomous bio-inspired approach. The contribution was experimentally evaluated by taking a set of well-known validated EEG Databases for Emotion Recognition. Computational experiments show promising results. Using our proposal for EEG emotion classification, we reach an accuracy close to 95%.

WoS,Neuroman: Voxel Phantoms from Surface Models of 300 Head Structures Including 12 Pairs of Cranial Nerves,"For a precise simulation of electromagnetic radiation effects, voxel phantoms require detailed structures to approximate humans. The phantoms currently used still do not have sophisticated structures. This paper presents voxel and surface models of 300 head structures with cranial nerves and reports on a technique for voxel reconstruction of the cranial nerves having very thin and small structures. In real-color sectioned images of the head (voxel size: 0.1 mm), 300 structures were segmented using Photoshop. A surface reconstruction was performed automatically on Mimics. Voxel conversion was run on Voxel Studio. The abnormal shapes of the voxel models were found and classified into three types: thin cord, thin layers, and thin parts in the structures. The abnormal voxel models were amended using extended, filled, and manual voxelization methods devised for this study. Surface models in STL format and as PDF files of the 300 head structures were produced. The STL format has good scalability, so it can be used in most three-dimensional surface model software. The PDF file is very user friendly for students and researchers who want to learn the head anatomy. Voxel models of 300 head structures were produced (TXT format), and their voxel quantity and weight were measured. A voxel model is difficult to handle, and the surface model cannot use the radiation simulation. Consequently, the best method for making precise phantoms is one in which the flaws of the voxel and surface models complement each other, as in the present study.",electromagnetic fields; human organs; medical imaging; phantom,"Park, JS",2020.0,Journal,HEALTH PHYSICS,10.1097/HP.0000000000001186,"[Park, Jin Seo] Dongguk Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat, 87 Dongdae Ro, Gyeongju Si, South Korea",LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,English,0017-9078,

WoS,A Numerical and Experimental Study on the Effects of CO(2)on Laminar Diffusion Methane/Air Flames,"Flue gas recirculation (FGR) is an effective method to reduce NO(x)emissions from the combustion of fuels, such as natural gas. Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water are the main components of flue gas. Nitrogen is an inert gas, and water can be condensed out of the effluent before FGR. However, recycled CO(2)can alter the physical and chemical combustion characteristics of a fuel. This research investigated the effects of CO(2)on CH4/air laminar diffusion flames, both experimentally and numerically. Experiments used laser-induced fluorescence to measure OH and CH distributions in the resulting flames, at different CO(2)concentrations. Numerical methods were used to investigate the reaction mechanism and predict temperature and species concentration fields, as well as the NO(x)formation. Experiments showed that the CH fluorescence intensities decreased with the addition of CO(2,)while the OH fluorescence intensities increased. Both the directed relation graph method and the sensitivity analysis method were used to reduce the GRI-mech 3.0 mechanism. The chemical kinetics of methane combustion were analyzed using the reduced mechanism with the diffusion opposed-flow flame model in thechemkin4.1 software package to determine the main reactions among the major species. Numerical simulations showed that as the amount of CO(2)in the fuel increased, the concentration of CH decreased. These CFD simulations using the reduced mechanism were in agreement with the experimental data. Thus, the reduced mechanism was then used to predict NO concentrations. Numerical simulations showed that as the amount of CO(2)in the fuel increased, the concentration of CH decreased, and, as a result, lower amounts of NO were predicted.",OH-PLIF; CH-PLIF; reduced mechanism; CFD; laminar diffusion flame; CO2 dilution,"Zhang, L; Ren, XH; Sun, R; Levendis, YA",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME,10.1115/1.4046228,"[Zhang, Lei; Sun, Rui] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Energy Sci & Engn, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Ren, Xiaohan] Shandong Univ, Inst Thermal Sci & Technol, Jinan 250061, Peoples R China; [Levendis, Yiannis A.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA",ASME,English,0195-0738,

Different indices were used to quantify obesity and fat distribution: BMI, percentage of body fat (%BF), waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). SOLAR software was used to perform univariate and bivariate quantitative genetic analyses adjusting for age, age(2), sex, age-sex and age(2)--sex interactions. Results: Heritabilities of BP ranged from 30.2 to 38.2% for ambulatory daytime, 16.8--21.4% for sleeping time, 32.1--40.4% for 24-h and 22--24.4% for office beat-to-beat measurements. Heritabilities for obesity indices were 67.8% for BMI, 52.2% for %BF, 37.3% for waist circumference and 37.9% for WHtR. All obesity measures had consistently positive phenotypic correlations with ambulatory and office beat-to-beat SBP and DBP (r-range: 0.14--0.32). Genetic correlations of obesity indices with SBP and DBP were higher than environmental correlations (r(G): 0.16--0.50;r(E): 0.01--0.31). Conclusion: The considerable genetic overlap between a variety of obesity indices and both ambulatory and office beat-to-beat BP highlights the relevance of pleiotropic genes. Future GWAS analyses should discover the specific genes both influencing obesity indices and BP to help unravel their shared genetic background.",ambulatory blood pressure; correlations; heritability; obesity indices; office beat-to-beat blood pressure,"Man, TF; Nolte, IM; Jaju, D; Al-Anqoudi, ZAM; Munoz, ML; Hassan, MO; Al-Yahyaee, S; Bayoumi, RA; Comuzzie, AG; Floras, JS; van Roon, AM; Riese, H; Albarwani, S; Snieder, H",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION,10.1097/HJH.0000000000002430,"[Man, Tengfei; Nolte, Ilja M.; Munoz, M.

WoS,How do pregnant women and new mothers navigate and respond to challenges in accessing health care? Perspectives from rural South Africa,"Women in low- and middle-income countries and in contexts characterized by inequality face various interpersonal and structural barriers when accessing formal maternal and child health (MCH) services. These barriers persist even in contexts where programs to increase access to services, such as community health worker (CHW) interventions, have been implemented. However, while barriers to accessing care have been extensively documented, less is known about the diverse ways that women respond to, and navigate, these situations. This study explores strategies pregnant women and new mothers use to navigate and respond to health care barriers in a rural district in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Twenty-six pregnant or recently delivered clients of the Enable Mentor Mother program were interviewed about their experiences of accessing formal MCH services. Interviews were conducted between February-March 2018 by an experienced isiXhosa-speaking research assistant, translated and transcribed into English, with transcripts coded and organized by themes using ATLAS.ti software. Facing resource shortages, inconsistent communication, and long travel times to clinics, participants employed diverse, innovative strategies to navigate interpersonal and structural barriers to care. While some participants chose to respond to barriers more passively-citing endurance and acceptance as practices of health system engagement-those participants who focused more on active responses tended to leverage their education, existing relationships, and available community resources to overcome barriers. Nevertheless, most participants described feelings of frustration and dejection. While CHW interventions may alleviate some of the burdens facing fragile health care systems in these contexts, these programs still rely on an underlying infrastructure of care that primary health care clinics and hospitals should be providing. Future programming should work in tandem with formal health systems and should support staff to improve quality of care provided to pregnant women, new mothers, and their infants to prioritize their health at a time of vulnerability.",South Africa; Health care access; Maternal and child health; Rural health; Patient responses,"Laurenzi, CA; Skeen, S; Coetzee, BJ; Gordon, S; Notholi, V; Tomlinson, M",2020.0,Journal,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113100,"[Laurenzi, Christina A.; Skeen, Sarah; Gordon, Sarah; Notholi, Vuyolwethu; Tomlinson, Mark] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Inst Life Course Hlth Res, Dept Global Hlth, 4009 Educ Bldg,Francie van Zijl Dr, ZA-7505 Tygerberg, Western Cape, South Africa; [Laurenzi, Christina A.; Coetzee, Bronwyne J.] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Psychol, Willcocks Bldg, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa; [Tomlinson, Mark] Queens Univ, Med Biol Ctr, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, 97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0277-9536,
WoS,Radiomics: A primer for the radiation oncologist,"Purpose. - Radiomics are a set of methods used to leverage medical imaging and extract quantitative features that can characterize a patient's phenotype. All modalities can be used with several different software packages. Specific informatics methods can then be used to create meaningful predictive models. In this review, we will explain the major steps of a radiomics analysis pipeline and then present the studies published in the context of radiation therapy. Methods. - A literature review was performed on Medline using the search engine PubMed. The search strategy included the search terms radiotherapy, radiation oncology and radiomics. The search was conducted in July 2019 and reference lists of selected articles were hand searched for relevance to this review. Results. - A typical radiomics workflow always includes five steps: imaging and segmenting, data curation and preparation, feature extraction, exploration and selection and finally modeling. In radiation oncology, radiomics studies have been published to explore different clinical outcome in lung (n= 5), head and neck (n= 5), esophageal (n= 3), rectal (n= 3), pancreatic (n= 2) cancer and brain metastases (n= 2). The quality of these retrospective studies is heterogeneous and their results have not been translated to the clinic. Conclusion. - Radiomics has a great potential to predict clinical outcome and better personalize treatment. But the field is still young and constantly evolving. Improvement in bias reduction techniques and multicenter studies will hopefully allow more robust and generalizable models. (C) 2020 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).

WoS,Hybrid differential evolution algorithm and genetic operator for multi-trip vehicle routing problem with backhauls and heterogeneous fleet in the beverage logistics industry,"Logistics is increasingly challenging because of increased competition and the uncertainty introduced by globalization. The drinks distribution system considered here uses glass bottles for soft drinks to deliver to all customers who need soft drinks in glass bottles, before making any pickups of empty glass bottles from clients to return to the company. This study aims at both an integer linear programming formulation and a novel hybrid differential evolution algorithm involving a genetic operator with fuzzy logic controller, for solving the multitrip vehicle routing problem with backhauls and a heterogeneous fleet. The objective function is to minimize total cost, which is related to distance travelled. For validation, we designed numerical experiments to compare the proposed approaches with LINGO computational software, using the conventional differential evolution algorithm and differential evolution with selected genetic operator and fuzzy logic controller in real settings.

WoS,A Reduced-Complexity Projection Algorithm for ADMM-Based LP Decoding,"The alternating direction method of multipliers has recently been adapted for linear programming decoding of low-density parity-check codes. The computation of the projection onto the parity polytope is the core of this algorithm and usually involves a sorting operation, which is the main effort of the projection. In this paper, we present an algorithm with low complexity to compute this projection. The algorithm relies on new findings in the recursive structure of the parity polytope and iteratively fixes selected components. As shown in our realistic simulation setup, it requires up to 37% less arithmetical operations compared with state-of-the-art projections. Additionally, it does not involve a sorting operation, which is needed in all exact state-of-the-art projection algorithms. These two benefits make it appealing for efficient hardware and software implementations.",Maximum likelihood decoding; Sorting; Projection algorithms; Parity check codes; Linear programming; Hardware; ADMM; LP decoding; parity polytope projection,"Gensheimer, F; Dietz, T; Kraft, K; Ruzika, S; Wehn, N",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY,10.1109/TIT.2020.2984247,"[Gensheimer, Florian] Univ Koblenz Landau, Math Inst, D-56070 Koblenz, Germany; [Dietz, Tobias; Ruzika, Stefan] Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Math, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Kraft, Kira; Wehn, Norbert] Tech Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,0018-9448,
WoS,Revisiting FPGA Implementation of Digital Filters and Exploring Approximate Computing on Biomedical Signals,"In recent years, the approximate computing becomes popular in the era of VLSI (very large scale integration) domain to arrive better power, area, and delay outcomes at the cost of lower precision loss. Also, the human beings are not so intelligent to see/observe/listen the processed digital data; means even if some of the data loss occurs human beings are unable to notice them. This behavior set the engineers to research on approximate computing which are very useful in the multimedia data processing, data communications, high-volume data storage, etc. In this study, the experiments such as hum-noise removal, filters on QRS detection are implemented on an Altera FPGA EP4CEF29C7 device using Quails II 13.1 synthesis software tool and the simulation results on device utilization reports, the speed and the power are obtained.

WoS,Digital Hearing Aids Using Automated Varying Bandwidth Finite Impulse Response Filter Banks,"A human auditory system is a highly complex sensitive system which transfers the acoustic sound into neuroelectrical signals toward the brain. Hearing difficulties or deafness are the outcomes of the problems occurred at any part of the auditory system. Assistive technologies such as hearing aids are developed to improve the quality of life of the hearing impaired people. Current digital hearing aids have fixed bandwidth filter banks which cannot provide enough flexibility to match with audiogram of different hearing loss. Recently, variable bandwidth filter banks have been introduced with different technologies to match more closely with the audiogram of a particular hearing loss. This research work proposes and implements a software controlled variable bandwidth FIR filter bank using Matlab GUI. In the Matlab GUI, in the filter bank, the bandwidth of every filter is adjusted dynamically in the Matlab GUI such that it fits more closely to the audiogram of a particular hearing loss. An experiment has been conducted in the developed Matlab GUI with various hearing loss, and the results show that the proposed system matches the filter bank magnitude response very closely to the audiogram of a particular hearing loss and reduces the matching error.",Digital Hearing Aid; Variable Bandwidth Filter Bank; Matlab GUI; Audiogram; Non-Uniform Filter Bank,"Jun, H; Jian, Z; Hong, Y; Jayabharathy, R; Gomathi, V; Valarmathi, R; Bagyalakshmi, G; Elamaran, V; Saravanan, S",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS,10.1166/jmihi.2020.3128,"[Jayabharathy, R.; Gomathi, V; Valarmathi, R.; Bagyalakshmi, G.; Elamaran, V] Shanmugha Arts Sci Technol Res Acad SASTRA Deemed, Sch Elect & Elect Engn EEE, Thanjavur 613403, Tamil Nadu, India; [Saravanan, S.] CMR Inst Technol, Dept Informat Sci & Engn, Bangalore 560037, Karnataka, India; [Jun, Hu; Jian, Zeng; Hong, Yi] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China",AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,English,2156-7018,
WoS,The Value of Computed Tomography Three-Dimensional Imaging Technology in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Sports Knee Ligament Strain,"Objective: To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the diagnosis and treatment of sports knee ligament strain, the application value of computerized tomography (CT) three-dimensional (3D) imaging technology in the diagnosis and treatment of sports knee ligament strain is studied. Methods: This study proposes a method for CT 3D image reconstruction based on the model clustering algorithm. First, the knee joint CT images of research objects are preprocessed. Second, based on the preprocessing, the healthy adult male knee ligament distribution structure map is used as a reference model. The model clustering segmentation algorithm proposed in this study is used for detailed segmentation, and the results are input into Materialise's interactive medical control system (Mimics) software. According to the process, the 3D CT reconstructed images are derived. Finally, the 3D reconstruction results of knee ligament CT are optimized by using Geomagic Studio 2012 software. The application of 3D CT images and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images obtained by the algorithm in this study in the diagnosis and treatment of knee ligament strains are compared. Results: The CT 3D image reconstruction method based on the model clustering algorithm proposed in this study can clearly show the ligament structure of the knee joint. The optimized CT 3D image has a smoother surface and a clearer display, which is more conducive for observing the knee joint ligament structure more clearly. The comparative experiments have found that the diagnostic accuracy of 3D CT images is 95%, and the diagnostic accuracy of MRI images is 85%. The diagnostic accuracy of the 3D reconstructed images proposed in this study is significantly higher than that of MRI images, and the difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05).

WoS,Genetic parameter estimation for reproductive traits in QingYu pigs and comparison of carcass and meat quality traits to BerkshirexQingYu crossbred pigs,"Objective: The QingYu pig is well known for its excellent meat quality attributes in Sichuan province, China. In order to improve its production efficiency, the determination of genetic factors contributing to quantifiable economic traits of livestock is important. Moreover, the cross-breeding of QingYu pigs with western breeds possessing strong growth attributes is an efficient way to improve the performance of this breed. Methods: Here, the genetic parameters of several important reproductive traits of QingYu pigs were estimated, include total number born (TNB), number born alive, litter birth weight, individual birth weight, number of piglets weaned, litter weaning weight, and individual weaning weight. The data was analyzed using the ASReml 3.0 software (NSW Inc., Sydney, Australia). Furthermore, the effects of crossing Berkshire with QingYu (BQ) pigs on carcass and meat quality traits, as well as the effects of slaughter weight on carcass and meat quality of BQ were characterized. Results: QingYu pigs exhibited superior reproductive traits. The TNB available to QingYu pigs was more than 8 per parity. The observed repeatability of the reproductive traits of the QingYu pigs was between 0.10 and 0.23. The significantly correlated genetic and phenotypic of reproduction traits were consistent. Interestingly, the BQ pigs exhibited improved carcass quality, with a significant increase in loin muscle area, lean percentage and reduction in sebum percentage. As a result, BQ had higher L-45min, lower cooking scores, and lower drip loss. In addition, the loin muscle area, body length, and sebum percentage were significantly higher in 90 and 100 kg animals. Cooking loss showed a significant increase at 80 kg, and marbling increased significantly from 90 kg. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that QingYu pigs exhibit excellent reproductive properties and heritability of these traits. Crossing with Berkshire is an efficient strategy to improve the carcass and meat quality of QingYu pigs for commercial operations. Furthermore, it appears as though the optimal slaughter weight of BQ pigs is at approximately 90 kg.",QingYu Pig; Reproductive; Genetic Parameter; Carcass and Meat Quality; Crossbred,"Luo, J; Yang, YT; Liao, K; Liu, B; Chen, Y; Shen, LY; Chen, L; Jiang, AN; Liu, YH; Li, Q; Wang, JY; Li, XW; Zhang, SH; Zhu, L",2020.0,Journal,ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES,10.5713/ajas.19.0105,"[Luo, Jia; Yang, Yiting; Liu, Bin; Shen, Linyuan; Chen, Lei; Jiang, Anan; Li, Xuewei; Zhang, Shunhua; Zhu, Li] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sdence & Technol, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jia] Southwest Univ, Coll Anim Sdence & Technol, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Liao, Kun] Bashan Anim Husb Technol Co LTD, Tongjiang 636700, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ying; Liu, Yihui; Li, Qiang] Sichuan Prov Gen Stn Anim Husb, Chengdu 610066, Sichuang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinyong] Chongqing Acad Anim Sci, Rongchang 402460, Peoples R China",ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN ASSOC ANIMAL PRODUCTION SOC,English,1011-2367,
WoS,Experimental study on freezing and thawing deformation of geogrid-reinforced silty clay structure,"Reinforcement can reduce soil's frost heave (F-H), but what kind of reinforcement condition is most beneficial to control soil's F-H if it is not clear? In this study, orthogonal experiments of freezing and thawing (F-T) to reinforced silty clay under different conditions were carried out. F-H, thaw settlement (T-S) deformation and water content of three different heights of melting clay were tested. T-S displacement was positively correlated with water content and more closely related to upper layer clay's water content. SPSS software was used to fit the regression equation of F-H and T-S displacement expressed by various influencing factors. The top three factors influencing the F-H and T-S displacement were initial water content, reinforcement spacing, and upper pressure. Taking the lowest displacement of F-H and T-S as control target, the optimal solution of all factors and target values were obtained with MATLAB software when the freezing temperature and number of freezing and thawing cycle (FTC) and upper pressure were - 15 degrees C, 5 times, and 30 kPa.

Materials and methods Thirty samples from pig cadaver tongues were obtained, through five laser settings, in continuous and pulsed wave (CW and PW). Samples were divided into six groups of five pieces each. A control specimen was taken by a scalpel. All samples were examined with an optical microscope by a blinded pathologist. Thermal effects on epithelium and connective tissues were measured with LAS 4.8 software. Finally, a statistical evaluation was made using GraphPadPrism 7.0 software. Results All specimens, except one, showed a damage lower than 1 mm.

WoS,Effects of an Electronic Software Prompt With Health Care Professional Training on Cardiovascular and Renal Complications in a Multiethnic Population With Type 2 Diabetes and Microalbuminuria (the GP-Prompt Study): Results of a Pragmatic Cluster-Randomized Trial,"OBJECTIVE Tight, targeted control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors can reduce cardiovascular complications and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and microalbuminuria. The effects of using an electronic prompt with a treatment algorithm to support a treat-to-target approach has not been tested in primary care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A multicenter, cluster-randomized trial was conducted among primary care practices across Leicestershire, U.K. The primary outcome was the proportion of individuals achieving systolic and diastolic blood pressure (<130 and <80 mmHg, respectively) and total cholesterol (<3.5 mmol/L) targets at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included proportion of individuals with HbA(1c)<58 mmol/mol (<7.5%), changes in prescribing, change in the albumin-to-creatinine ratio, major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and coding accuracy. RESULTS A total of 2,721 individuals from 22 practices, mean age 63 years, 41% female, and 62% from black and minority ethnic groups completed 2 years of follow-up. There were no significant differences in the proportion of individuals achieving the composite primary outcome, although the proportion of individuals achieving the prespecified outcome of total cholesterol <4.0 mmol/L (odds ratio 1.24; 95% CI 1.05-1.47;P= 0.01) increased with intensive intervention compared with control. Coding for microalbuminuria increased relative to control (odds ratio 2.05; 95% CI 1.29-3.25;P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Greater improvements in composite cardiovascular risk factor control with this intervention compared with standard care were not achieved in this cohort of high-risk individuals with T2DM. However, improvements in lipid profile and coding can benefit patients with diabetes to alter the high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Future studies should consider comprehensive strategies, including patient education and health care professional engagement, in the management of T2DM.",,"Willis, A; Crasto, W; Gray, LJ; Dallosso, H; Waheed, G; Davies, M; Seidu, S; Khunti, K",2020.0,Journal,DIABETES CARE,10.2337/dc19-2243,"[Willis, Andrew; Crasto, Winston; Dallosso, Helen; Waheed, Ghazala; Davies, Melanie; Seidu, Sam; Khunti, Kamlesh] Univ Leicester, Diabet Res Ctr, Leicester, Leics, England; [Willis, Andrew; Khunti, Kamlesh] Natl Inst Hlth Res Appl Res Collaborat ARC East M, Leicester, Leics, England; [Crasto, Winston] George Eliot Hosp Natl Hlth Serv Trust, Nuneaton, England; [Gray, Laura J.] Univ Leicester, Dept Hlth Sci, Leicester, Leics, England; [Davies, Melanie] Leicester Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Leicester, Leics, England",AMER DIABETES ASSOC,English,0149-5992,
WoS,Effective dose for multiple and repeated radiation examinations in donors and recipients of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplants at a single center,"Purpose: To evaluate the effective doses received by donors and recipients, identify effective dose contributions, and make risk assessments. Materials and Methods: It was a retrospective study. 100 Donors and 100 recipients were enrolled with an operative day from March 2016 to August 2017. The dose was analyzed for all radiation-related examinations over a period of 2 years, 1 year before and 1 year after the LDLT procedure. The effective doses of plain X-rays, CT, fluoroscopy, and nuclear medicine per patient were simulated by a Monte Carlo software, evaluated by the doselength product conversion factors, evaluated by the dose-area product conversion factors, and evaluated by the activity conversion factors, respectively. The risks of radiation-induced cancer were assessed on the basis of the ICRP risk model. Results: The median effective doses were 71 (range: 30-186) mSv for donors and 147 (32-423) mSv for recipients. The radiation examinations were mainly performed in the last three months of preoperative period to first month of postoperative period for recipients and donors. The HCC recipients received a higher effective dose, 195 (64-423) mSv, than those with other indications. The median radiation-induced cancer risk was 0.38 % in male and 0.48 % in female donors and was 0.50 % in male and 0.58 % in female recipients. Conclusion: Donors and recipients received a large effective dose, mainly from the CT scans. To reduce effective doses should be included in future challenges in some living donor liver transplants centers that often use CT examinations.",Effective dose; Liver transplant; Living; Donor; Recipient,"Chiang, HW; Chuang, TC; Chen, CL; Tyan, YS; Lin, TL; Tsang, LLC; Tu, JA; Chou, YH; Tsai, HY; Chen, TR",2020.0,Journal,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109078,"[Chiang, Hsien-Wen; Chuang, Tzu-Chao] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chen, Chao-Long; Lin, Ting-Lung] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Liver Transplantat Ctr, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan; [Chen, Chao-Long; Lin, Ting-Lung; Tsang, Leo Leung-Chit] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan; [Chen, Chao-Long; Lin, Ting-Lung; Tsang, Leo Leung-Chit] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Surg, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan; [Tyan, Yeu-Sheng] Chung Shan Med Univ, Sch Med, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Tyan, Yeu-Sheng; Chen, Tou-Rong] Chung Shan Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Tsang, Leo Leung-Chit] Chang Gung Univ, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Diagnost Radiol, Coll Med, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan; [Tu, Jou-An] E Da Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan; [Chou, Ying-Hsiang] Chung Shan Med Univ Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Chou, Ying-Hsiang; Chen, Tou-Rong] Chung Shan Med Univ, Dept Med Imaging & Radiol Sci, 110,Sec 1,Jianguo N Rd, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Tsai, Hui-Yu] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Nucl Engn & Sci, Taipei 300, Taiwan",ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,English,0720-048X,
WoS,Detection and Characterization of Monosodium Urate and Calcium Hydroxyapatite Crystals Using Spectral Photon-Counting Radiography: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Objective: To assess the potential of spectral photon-counting (PC) radiography (SPCR) for the detection and characterization of monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals, based on effective atomic number (Z(eff)) values derived from specific X-ray attenuation characteristics at different energy levels. Methods: Suspensions of either pure agar, synthetic MSU (200 mg/ml) or HA (100 and 150 mg/ml) crystals in agar were sealed in industry-standard polystyrene vials and supported on a 2.5-mm-thick plastic table. Samples were scanned using a vendor microfocus X-ray tube and a spectral PC detector prototype with four energy thresholds per acquisition (15, 25, 30, and 35 keV). Material decomposition calibration was performed using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) slabs. Using a custom post-processing software based on polynomial material decomposition, Z(eff) of the respective samples were computed. All samples were additionally scanned using dual-energy CT (DECT, 80 kV and tin-filtered 150 kV) and analyzed with a proprietary post-processing algorithm for gout. Results: MSU crystal suspension attenuated significantly less than both HA samples. MSU and HA suspensions differed significantly in Z(eff) (mean +/- SD: 7.74 +/- 0.28 vs. 9.43 +/- 0.41, p <.001). Z(eff) values from SPCR were comparable to DECT-based reference values (p = 0.16) and were independent of the radiation dose level (0.18 18 mAs, p = 1). Discussion: This in vitro feasibility study demonstrates the potential of SPCR for discriminating MSU from HA crystal suspensions based on Z(eff) differences. Further studies have to corroborate these initial findings ex vivo and in vivo, and to compare the diagnostic performance of SPCR with DECT in imaging of crystal-associated arthropathies.",photon-counting detector; spectral radiography; crystal-associated arthropathies; gout; monosodium urate; calcium hydroxyapatite,"Huber, FA; Gkoumas, S; Thuring, T; Becce, F; Guggenberger, R",2020.0,Journal,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109080,"[Huber, Florian A.; Guggenberger, Roman] Univ Hosp Zurich, Inst Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Raemistr 100, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [Huber, Florian A.; Guggenberger, Roman] Univ Zurich, Fac Med, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gkoumas, Spyridon; Thuring, Thomas] DECTRIS Ltd, Baden Daettwil, Switzerland; [Becce, Fabio] Lausanne Univ Hosp, Dept Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Becce, Fabio] Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,English,0720-048X,
WoS,Altered structural cerebral cortex in children with Tourette syndrome,"Purpose: In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the anatomical alterations of cerebral cortex in children with Tourette syndrome (TS) and explore whether such deficits were related with their clinical symptoms. Methods: All subjects were scanned in a 3.0T MRI scanner with three-dimensional T1-weighted images (3DT1WI). Then, some surface-based features were extracted by using the FreeSurfer software. After that, the between-group differences of those features were assessed. Results: Sixty TS patients and 52 age- and gender-matched healthy control were included in this study. Surfacebased analyses revealed altered cortical thickness, cortical sulcus, cortical curvature and local gyrification index (LGI) in TS group compared with healthy controls. The brain regions with significant-group differences in cortical thickness included postcentral gyrus, superiorparietal gyrus, rostral anterior cingulate cortex in the left hemisphere and frontal pole, lateral occipital gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere. In addition, the superior temporal gyrus, medial orbitofrontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, medial orbitofrontal gyrus, superiorparietal gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus showed significant between-group differences for cortical sulcus. Moreover, the brain regions with significant between-group differences in cortical curvature were located in caudal anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus and lateral occipital gyrus. The alteration of LGI were most prominent in the inferior temporal gyrus and insula. Additionally, there was no statistical difference in brain surface area for TS children compared with controls.

WoS,Preoperative vascular heterogeneity and aggressiveness assessment of pituitary macroadenoma based on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI texture analysis,"Purpose: To assess the vascular heterogeneity and aggressiveness of pituitary macroadenomas (PM) using texture analysis based on Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Method: Fifty patients with pathologically confirmed PM, including 32 patients with aggressive PM (aggressive group) and 18 patients with non-aggressive PM (non-aggressive group), were included in this study. The preoperative DCE-MRI and clinical data were collected from all patients. The features based on Ktrans, Ve, and Kep were generated using Omni-Kinetics software. Independent-samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for comparison between two groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the optimal model for distinguishing aggressive and non-aggressive PM. Results: Six features related to tumor morphology, 24 features in Ktrans, 20 features in Ve, and 3 features in Kep were significantly different between the aggressive and non-aggressive groups. Volume count, gray-level nonuniformity in Ktrans, voxel value sum in Ve and run-length non-uniformity in Kep (AUC= 0.816, 0.903, 0.785, 0.813) were considered the best feature for tumor diagnosis. After modeling, the diagnosis efficiency of mean model and total model was desirable (AUC= 0.859 and 0.957), and the diagnostic efficiency of morphological, Ktrans, Ve and Kep features model was improved (AUC= 0.845, 0.951, 0.847, 0.804).

WoS,Establishment and Solution for a Mathematical Model of Multiple Diffuse Reflection,"The indirect illumination system with diffuse reflection light-emitting diode (LED) is widely applied in various fields that require high illumination uniformity. On the basis of the Lambertian characteristic of LEDs and the ideal diffuse surface, a design method that features a multiple diffuse reflectance freeform surface is proposed and its related mathematical model is established in this paper. A nonlinear algebraic equation is solved to redistribute the energy emitted by the LED to a uniformity illuminated scene. The outline of the diffuse surface is obtained by solving equations numerically. With the use of the ray tracing software TracePro, simulation results show that the effect is generally the best and the uniformity and efficiency are significantly improved compared with other methods when the proportion between the radius of the target surface and the distance between the LED light source and the target surface is 1:4.",Diffuse reflection; uniform illumination; freeform surface,"Zhu, ZM; Xu, X; Sun, X; Wang, XY",2020.0,Journal,IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL,10.1109/JPHOT.2020.3003543,"[Zhu, Zhenmin; Xu, Xin; Wang, Xinyun] East China Jiaotong Univ, Sch Elect & Automat Engn, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiang] Fudan Univ, Acad Engn & Technol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,1943-0655,
WoS,Information Needs for Treatment Decision-making of Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Patients 65 Years or Older and Caregivers,"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a complex and potentially life-threatening treatment option for patients with hematologic malignant and non-malignant diseases. Advances have made HCT a potentially curative treatment option for patients 65 years of age and older (older patients), and patient education resources should be adapted to meet their needs. To better understand the information needs of older patients and their caregivers for HCT treatment decision-making, the National Marrow Donor Program (R) (NMDP)/Be The Match (R) conducted a qualitative comprehensive needs assessment. Focus groups, offered in person or by phone, were conducted with older HCT patients and primary caregivers of older HCT patients at three transplant centers in the USA that were selected based on the number of older adults treated and geographic diversity. The one-hour, semi-structured discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The analysis was performed with the NVivo 10 software for identification of conceptual themes. Five telephone and six in person focus groups of patients (n = 35) and caregivers (n = 10) were conducted. Themes that emerged included the following: (1) the need for tailored resources with age-specific recovery expectations; (2) the need for the right amount of information at the right times; and (3) the benefit of peer support. Effective patient education supports learning and treatment decision-making. As HCT increasingly becomes a treatment option for older patients, tailored educational resources are needed. These focus group results can inform and guide the development of new educational resources for older adults with hematologic diseases considering and planning for HCT.",Treatment decision-making; Hematopoietic cell transplant; Older patients; Caregivers,"Foster, J; Moore, H; Preussler, JM; Burns, LJ; Umar, JH; Glotzbecker, B; Johnson, S; MacDougall, H; Mau, LW; Murphy, EA; Ustun, C; Ferguson, SS; Denzen, E",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION,10.1007/s13187-019-01506-5,"[Foster, Jackie; Moore, Heather; Preussler, Jaime M.; Burns, Linda J.; Umar, Jenna Hullerman; Mau, Lih-Wen; Murphy, Elizabeth A.; Ferguson, Stacy Stickney; Denzen, Ellen] Natl Marrow Donor Program Be Match, 500 N 5th St, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA; [Preussler, Jaime M.; Burns, Linda J.; Umar, Jenna Hullerman; Mau, Lih-Wen; Denzen, Ellen] Ctr Int Blood & Marrow Transplant Res, 500 N 5th St, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA; [Glotzbecker, Brett] Dana Farber Canc Inst, 400 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Johnson, Shirley] City Hope Comprehens Canc Ctr, 1500 East Durate Rd, Duarte, CA 91010 USA; [MacDougall, Hannah; Ustun, Celalettin] Univ Minnesota, 420 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",SPRINGER,English,0885-8195,
WoS,Variation of Poisson's ratio of fabrics woven with helical composite auxetic weft yarns in relation to fabric structural parameters,"Auxetic textiles are defined as textiles with negative Poisson's ratio. These textiles possess unique properties that render them suitable for special applications. This work aims to investigate the effect of fabric structural parameters such as thread densities, weave design and warp yarn count. Thus, 30 fabric samples were woven at 3 weft and 2 warp densities, respectively. Two warp counts and three weave designs of plain, basket 3/3 and weft-backed satin 6 were used. The samples were uniaxially loaded in weft direction and dimensional changes at various strains levels were evaluated. The evaluation was carried out using the image processing technique based on MATLAB software. The weft yarns used were found to exhibit auxetic behavior at the whole spectrum of the strain level used. The least weft yarn Poisson's ratio was found to be -0.9. It was established that in general the fabric samples exhibit auxetic effect within the stated range of strain. Additionally, it was concluded that while fabric thread densities together with warp count influence the minimum fabric Poisson's ratio, auxetic behavior of the samples is not dependent on weave design alone. Rather, it was illustrated that the combined effect of weave design in association with stated structural parameters on auxetic feature cannot be ignored.",Auxetic woven fabrics; auxetic yarn; negative Poisson's ratio; double-helix yarn; helical auxetic yarn,"Lolaki, A; Shanbeh, M",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES,10.1177/1528083718823290,"[Lolaki, Asal; Shanbeh, Mohsen] Isfahan Univ Technol, Dept Text Engn, Esfahan, Iran",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,English,1528-0837,

The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between religious beliefs with CG, depression, anxiety and stress (DAS) in caregivers of patients with SCI in the city of Ilam, Iran. This is a descriptive-analytic article, and the study population were caregivers of patients with SCI. A sample size of 150 patients was selected according to previous studies. The questionnaires used for data collection included Religious Coping Questionnaire (RC), Caregiver Questionnaire (CG), and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) Items. In this study, caregivers of patients with SCI were included in the study using convenience sampling method in Ilam city. The researchers identified patient caregivers who met the inclusion criteria. The research objectives were described for caregivers, and the questioners were initiated if caregivers were willing to participate in the study. Literate caregivers completed questionnaires through interviews, and trained questioners completed for illiterate caregivers in the same way (interviewing).

WoS,"Explaining an Influential Model of the Significant Relationship Between Religion, Spirituality, and Environmental Peace in Mosque Interior Architecture","Investigating the components of environmental peace in an architectural work, especially Islamic mosques, requires a detailed understanding of this concept and its influential factors. In the architecture of the mosques of the past, certain patterns have always followed a continuous trend that made a logical relationship with the time before and after, but this continuity and trend are not seen today. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of environmental peace from two aspects of religion and spirituality. Religion means comprehensive instructions and complete guidelines that, on the one hand, show the goal and teaches the human being how to achieve it, and on the other hand, help the human being on problems that are difficult to understand by universal means of understanding (reason, experience, and intuition). Therefore, the identification of the true ultimate goal in human life as well as the determination of the intermediate goals that indicate the path to the ultimate goal is possible only through the recognition and adherence to the right religion, and this fact shows the close relationship between religion and spirituality. The research method investigates the relationship between variables through a correlation method and then through structural equations. The statistical population was selected based on the Cochran formula including 120 professors and postgraduate students in architecture and Islamic architecture of Tehran Universities. The research tool was a web-based questionnaire and its link was made available to the statistical community online. The structural equation method was used in SPSS and Amos software to test the regression and fitting test model. Pearson correlation test was also used to determine the relationship between research variables. The results show that the model of the influence of religion factors in enhancing environmental peace through the mediating variable of spirituality explains these relationships; in other words, in this indirect causal relation, enhancement of semantic factors mediated by spirituality factors enhances environmental peace in architecture.",Spirituality; Meaning; Religion; Mosque architecture; Model presentation,"Mandinejad, JED; Azemati, H; Habibabad, AS",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH,10.1007/s10943-020-00983-z,"[Mandinejad, Jamal-e-Din; Azemati, Hamidreza; Habibabad, Ali Sadeghi] Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training Univ SRTTU, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Tehran, Iran",SPRINGER,English,0022-4197,
WoS,"The Effectiveness of New Adiposity Indices on Plasma Lipid Profile in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: A Cross-Sectional Study with A Body Shape Index, Body Roundness Index, and Visceral Adiposity Index","Objective: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of three different indices used to identify the effect of visceral adiposity on lipid profile markers in patients with multiple sclerosis. Methods: The study consisted of a total of 152 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who were aged 18 years and older. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) were accessed from the patient system. Patients' height, body weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference measurements were also obtained. The effects of three different adiposity indices, including A Body Shape Index (ABSI), the Body Roundness Index (BRI), and the Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI), on plasma lipid profile in multiple sclerosis patients were evaluated. The data were analyzed using the R software and SPSS 21 statistical software package. Results: HDL-c was impacted by ABSI and VAI in males and only VAI in females (p < 0.05). An increase of 0.01 units of ABSI in males led to an increase of 5.88 mg/dL in plasma HDL-c level. In male patients with multiple sclerosis, LDL-c was positively affected by BRI and VAI changes (p < 0.05). One unit increase in BRI in males increased LDL-c level by 5.56 mg/dL, whereas 1 unit increase in VAI increased LDL-c level by 3.52 mg/dL (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study indicated that these three different indices employed to evaluate adiposity were associated with plasma lipid profile. The effect of VAI on plasma lipids is higher than that of the other indices. In patients with multiple sclerosis, the use of these practical and non-invasive indices will be useful in assessing plasma lipid profile.",Multiple sclerosis; A Body Shape Index; Body Roundness Index; Visceral Adiposity Index,"Uzdil, Z; Kaya, S; Kaya, PS; Terzi, M; Dunder, E",2020.0,Journal,MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS,10.1016/j.msard.2020.102214,"[Uzdil, Zeynep; Kaya, Pinar Sokulmez] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Samsun, Turkey; [Kaya, Seda] Ankara Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Ankara, Turkey; [Terzi, Murat] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Samsun, Turkey; [Dunder, Emre] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Stat, Samsun, Turkey",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,2211-0348,

WoS,Association of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle metrics with overall survival and postoperative complications in soft tissue sarcoma patients: an opportunistic study using computed tomography,"Background: To determine the relationship between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle measurements on computed tomography (CT) and overall survival and major postoperative complications in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). Methods: The retrospective study included 137 STS patients (75 men, 62 women; mean age, 53 years, SD 17.7; mean BMI, 28.5, SD 6.6) who had abdominal CT exams. On a single CT image, at the L4 pedicle level, measurements of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and skeletal muscle area and attenuation were obtained using clinical PACS and specialized segmentation software. Clinical information was recorded, including STS characteristics (size, depth, grade, stage, and site), overall survival, and postoperative complications. The relationships between CT metrics and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models and those between CT metrics and postoperative complications using logistic regression models. Results: There were 33 deaths and 41 major postoperative complications. Measured on clinical PACS, the psoas area (P=0.003), psoas index (P=0.006), psoas attenuation (P=0.011), and total muscle attenuation (P=0.023) were associated with overall survival. Using specialized software, psoas attenuation was also associated with overall survival (P=0.018). Adipose tissue metrics were not associated with survival or postoperative complications. Conclusions: In STS patients, CT-derived muscle size and attenuation are associated with overall survival. These prognostic biomarkers can be obtained using specialized segmentation software or routine clinical PACS.",Computed tomography (CT); muscle; myosteatosis; sarcopenia; soft-tissue sarcoma (STS),"Boutin, RD; Katz, JR; Chaudhari, AJ; Yabes, JG; Hirschbein, JS; Nakache, YP; Seibert, JA; Lamba, R; Fananapazir, G; Canter, RJ; Lenchik, L",2020.0,Journal,QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY,10.21037/qims.2020.02.09,"[Boutin, Robert D.] Stanford Univ, Dept Radiol, Med Ctr, 300 Pasteur Dr,MC5105, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Katz, Jeremy R.] Integrated Imaging Associates, Oak Lawn, IL USA; [Chaudhari, Abhijit J.; Seibert, J.

WoS,A New Gantry-Tau-Based Mechanism Using Spherical Wrist and Model Predictive Control-Based Motion Cueing Algorithm,"The 3 degree-of-freedom Gantry-Tau manipulator with the addition of the spherical wrist mechanism which is called Gantry-Tau-3R is designed as a high-G simulation-based motion platform (SBMP) with the capability of generating the large linear and angular displacement. The combination of both parallel and serial manipulator in newly designed Gantry-Tau-3R mechanism improves the ability of the mechanism to regenerate larger motion signals with higher linear acceleration and angular velocity. The high-frequency signals are reproduced using the parallel part of the mechanism, and sustainable low-frequency accelerations are regenerated via the serial part due to the larger rotational motion capability, which will be used through motion cueing algorithm tilt coordination channel. The proportional integral derivative (PID) and fuzzy incremental controller (FIC) are developed for the proposed mechanism to show the high path tracking performance as a motion platform. FIC reduces the motion tracking error of the newly designed Gantry-Tau-3R and increases the motion fidelity for the users of the proposed SBMP. The proposed method is implemented using Matlab/Simulink software. Finally, the results demonstrate the accurate motion signal generation using linear model predictive motion cues with a fuzzy controller, which is not possible using the common parallel and serial manipulators.",Simulation-based motion platform; High-G Gantry-Tau-3R manipulator; PID controller; FIC; Linear Model Predictive-based Motion Cueing Algorithm,"Qazani, MRC; Asadi, H; Nahavandi, S",2020.0,Journal,ROBOTICA,10.1017/S0263574719001516,"[Qazani, Mohammad Reza Chalak; Asadi, Houshyar; Nahavandi, Saeid] Deakin Univ, Inst Intelligent Syst Res & Innovat, Waurn Ponds Campus, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,English,0263-5747,
WoS,Future projection of the effects of climate change on saffron yield and spatial-temporal distribution of cultivation by incorporating the effect of extreme climate indices,"In this study, precipitation- and temperature-related indices were considered using Rclimdex software to study trend of climate extreme indices. Daily minimum and maximum temperature data retrieved from MPI-ESM-LR and ACCESS1-0 global climate model were used to predict future climate extreme events over the next three periods of 2026-2050, 2051-2075, and 2076-2100 based on IPCC scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 of studied area covering South Khorasan province and southern part of Razavi Khorasan province, located in east of Iran; furthermore, future saffron yield was predicted based on the yield-extreme indices model. Results showed an increasing trend of warm climate extreme indices and a decreasing trend in precipitation indices as important factors in the decrease of saffron yield. Considering multiple regression yield model of saffron based on climate extreme indices, it was concluded that saffron yield decreases in future periods over studied area with the highest reduction of 31% in period of 2076-2100 under RCP8.5 scenario. Results also confirmed that yield reduction in all three periods under RCP8.5 scenario was greater than the same periods under RCP 4.5 scenario.",Saffron; Iran; Climate change; RCP scenarios; Climate extreme indices,"Kouzegaran, S; Baygi, MM; Babaeian, I; Khashei-Siuki, A",2020.0,Journal,THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,10.1007/s00704-020-03241-0,"[Kouzegaran, Saeedeh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Agr, Water Engn Dept, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Mousavi Baygi, Mohamad] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Agr, Water Engn Dept, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Babaeian, Iman] Natl Climate Res Inst, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Khashei-Siuki, Abbas] Univ Birjand, Fac Agr, Water Engn Dept, Birjand, Iran",SPRINGER WIEN,English,0177-798X,
WoS,A Population Pharmacokinetics Model for Vancomycin Dosage Optimization Based on Serum Cystatin C,"Background and Objectives Renal function has an important influence on the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin, and serum cystatin C (CysC) exhibits accurate predictive performance as a marker for renal function. This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) model of vancomycin based on serum CysC in pediatric patients. In addition, vancomycin dosage was optimized with the area under the serum concentration-time curve over 24 h (AUC(0-24))/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio in the target range of 400-700 and the steady-state trough concentration (C-ss,C-trough). Methods Data were retrospectively obtained from pediatric patients aged 2-18 years who received vancomycin treatment for infection from January 2014 to June 2019. PopPK analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted using nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM) software. Results A total of 220 children were included. Serum CysC and age were significant covariates affecting the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin. The final typical value of clearance was 2.25 L/h; the volume of distribution was 8.17 L. The average probability of target attainment values of AUC(0-24)/MIC ratios within 400-700 in the 2-7, 7-12, and 12-18 years age groups were 66.1%, 68.1% and 66.5%, respectively. The medianC(ss,trough)values of vancomycin for the 2-7, 7-12, and 12-18 years age groups were 7.49-11.84, 5.98-11.32, and 5.15-11.39 mg/L, respectively, and were highly correlated with AUC(0-24)/MIC ratios in the range of 400-700 when the MIC was 1 mg/L. Conclusions The pharmacokinetic parameters for vancomycin in pediatric patients were estimated using a serum CysC model.

WoS,CORRELATION OF LINEAR TYPE TRAITS WITH MILK YIELD IN NILI RAVI BUFFALOES OF PAKISTAN,"Nili Ravi buffaloes are considered black gold being highest milk producers in the world. The study was performed for genetic evaluation of linear type traits and explore their relationships with milk production traits of Nili Ravi buffaloes. Data on Nili Ravi Buffaloes (n=437) present at 5 experimental livestocks farms in Punjab, Pakistan were recorded for linear type traits follwoing ICAR gudelines and adopting a linear scale of 1-9 during 2010-2012 encompassing 1180 records for each trait. A mixed effect model was applied where herd, year, parity, season were fitted as fixed effects and age as covariable. All analyses were performed by using Proc GLM of the SAS software. Variance components were estimated by ASREML software and genetic parameters were computed by post -processing. Least square means for linear scores of stature, chest width, body depth, angularity, rump angle and rump width were 5.07 +/- 1.35, 5.23 +/- 2.35, 5.41 +/- 1.49, 5.76 +/- 0.98, 6.73 +/- 1.53, 4.91 +/- 1.85, respectively. Corresponding genetic correlations (r(G)(2)) of linear scores of the traits with test day milk yield were 0.57 +/- 0.05, 0.09 +/- 0.02, 0.31 +/- 0.04, 0.06 +/- 0.02, 0.15 +/- 0.03 and 0.30 +/- 0.05, respectively while with 305 days milk yield were 0.14 +/- 0.00, 0.04 +/- 0.00, 0.21 +/- 0.00, 0.02 +/- 0.00, 0.11 +/- 0.00 and 0.19 +/- 0.00, respectively.

WoS,Experimental study on hydrogen behavior and possible risk with different injection conditions in local compartment,"Comparing with the large containment, the gas can not flow freely within the local compartment due to the small volume of the compartment in case of serious accident, which affects the hydrogen flow distribution, and it will determines the location where high concentration occurs in compartment. In this paper, hydrogen distribution and possible hydrogen risk in the vessel under the different conditions are investigated. The results show that when the initial gas momentum is increased, the ability of gas enters into the upper region of the vessel will be strengthened, and the hydrogen volume fraction in the upper region of the vessel is higher. Comparing with horizontal source direction, when source direction is vertically towards upper space, hydrogen is more likely to accumulate in the upper region of the vessel. With the increasing of steam mass flow, the dilution effect of steam on the hydrogen volume fraction will be strengthened, while the pressure in the vessel is also increased. When steam flow is decreased, the hydrogen explosion risk is higher in the vessel. The experiment data can provide technical support for the validation of the CFD software and the mitigation of hydrogen risk in the containment compartment.

WoS,Dependency-aware software release planning through mining user preferences,"Software vendors aim to find, for a release of the software, an optimal subset of features that gives the highest value while respecting the resource limitations. The value of a feature subset, however, is determined by the values of the individual features within that subset-which are specified by the preferences of users. But user preferences for some features may change in the presence or absence of others. As such, the values of certain software features may be influenced, either positively or negatively, by other features. Such influences are widely recognized and referred to in the literature asvalue-related dependenciesamong software features. Value-related dependencies impact the overall value of a software product and, therefore, need to be considered in software release planning. To achieve this, we have proposed identifying value-related dependencies by mining user preferences for software features. We integrate these dependencies into an integer programming model, that finds an optimal subset of the features for a release of a software product. We have demonstrated the practicality of our proposed approach by studying a real-world software project and simulations.",Fuzzy; Dependency; Mining; User preferences; Release planning,"Mougouei, D; Powers, DMW",2020.0,Journal,SOFT COMPUTING,10.1007/s00500-019-04630-y,"[Mougouei, Davoud] Univ Wollongong, Sch Comp & IT, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Powers, David M.

WoS,A systematic review and meta-analysis of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound guided fusion biopsy of prostate for cancer detection-Comparing transrectal with transperineal approaches,"Targeted biopsy using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging increases the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (csCaP). In this meta-analysis, we compare the diagnostic accuracy of transrectal (TR) vs transperineal (TP) approaches for MRI-guided software fusion biopsy (FB) in the detection of csCaP. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane and Embase electronic databases up until July 2019 following the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis system. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of either approach was evaluated using radical prostatectomy or systematic biopsies with >= 24 biopsy cores to be the reference standard. Fourteen papers with a total of 2002 patients were selected. Seven hundred and sixty-five patients underwent TR FB, while 1,387 underwent TP FB. One hundred and fifty of the patients underwent both TR and TP approaches. Both approaches were similar in terms of sensitivity (TR vs. TP: 0.81 vs 0.80) and specificity (TR vs. TP: 0.99 vs 0.95). In terms of likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratio, TR performed better than TP approach. The area under the receiving operator curve for both approaches was similar (0.91 vs 0.88 respectively). However, there was substantial heterogeneity across the studies for both approaches. TP and TR approaches to software-based FB yield similar diagnostic performance for the detection of csCaP. When deciding on the approach, physicians should consider other inherent features of either technique that suit their practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,Information-Theoretic Remodularization of Object-Oriented Software Systems,"Software remodularization consists in reorganizing software entities into modules such that pairs of entities belonging to the same modules are more similar than those belonging to different modules. In recent years, Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) approach has gained unprecedented growth for solving software remodularization problem. Most of the previous studies remodularize the software system by optimizing the structural coupling and cohesion metrics as objective functions. These metrics are defined in terms of the number of structural relationships counts, rather than taking patterns of relationships. It has been observed that the computation of coupling and cohesion based on patterns of relationships (i.e., information-theory based) are more accurate than the number of relationships. This paper proposes an information-theoretic software remodularization where an entropy-based similarity measure is introduced as an objective function along with other objective functions i.e., inter-module class change coupling, intra-module class change coupling, module size index (MSI), and module count index (MCI) and is further optimized using many-objective meta-heuristic algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, seven object-oriented software systems have been remodularized using NSGA-III, MOEA/D, IBEA, and TAA algorithms. The results are compared with existing multi-objective formulation of remodularization problem in terms of authoritative software remodularization, non-extreme distribution, and stability. The experimentation results suggest that the proposed approach can be a good alternative to improve the quality of software systems. The findings suggest that the approach is more suitable for generating remodularization solution good from both quality metrics and developers perspective.",Search; based software engineering; Software remodularization; Software entropy; Information theoretic technique,"Prajapati, A; Chhabra, JK",2020.0,Journal,INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS,10.1007/s10796-019-09897-y,"[Prajapati, Amarjeet] JIIT Noida, Dept Comp Engn & IT, Noida, UP, India; [Chhabra, Jitender Kumar] NIT Kurukshetra, Dept Comp Engn, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India",SPRINGER,English,1387-3326,
WoS,From Agile to DevOps: Smart Skills and Collaborations,"Although agile software development approaches have become increasingly prevalent, many organizations, have found they were not able to achieve a more frequent release cadence, largely due to different departmental functions operating in silos. In an effort to remove these silos, companies have moved towards DevOps. As digitalization continues, companies increasingly implement DevOps. We suggest three different stages in the agile to DevOps transition: agile, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. Based on an in-depth case study in an organization with several years' experience in DevOps, we identify a fundamental disruption in the soft skills that software teams are expected to possess, and in the patterns of collaboration among teams. Arguably, smartness may be characterized as being flexible, teaming up with people who have a different profile, belonging to a different function, and achieving a quicker delivery schedule.

WoS,Optimal Piracy Control: Should a Firm Implement Digital Rights Management?,"Many firms offer digital rights management (DRM) technologies to increase the piracy cost, thereby protecting illegal copy and distribution. However, many industrial cases contradict the speculation that using DRM technologies reduces legal users' net value. Therefore, we develop a theoretical model to examine the trade-off based on consumer heterogeneity in piracy cost sensitivity to explore under what conditions a monopoly implements DRM policy. In the model, we categorize pirates into two types according to their behaviours in the piracy process. We find that adopting DRM restriction is profitable to the firm when the level of DRM restriction is high. The optimal restriction level is the maximal technological level when piracy cost is high and the maximal technological level is higher than a threshold. In addition, we derive that the firm should implement policies to prevent downloading unauthorized products shared by other legal users from a P2P network. When both piracy cost and DRM restriction level are low, a lower piracy cost increases the firm's profit.",Piracy; Digital rights management; Cost sensitivity; Pricing; Digital products,"Wu, D; Nan, GF; Li, MQ",2020.0,Journal,INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS,10.1007/s10796-019-09907-z,"[Wu, Dan; Nan, Guofang; Li, Minqiang] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,1387-3326,

WoS,"Buckle Propagation in Steel Pipes of Ultra-high Strength: Experiments, Theories and Numerical Simulations","In this paper, experimental, theoretical and numerical approaches were employed to scrutinize the buckle propagation events occurring in pipes subjected to external pressure. Two groups of samples with different radius-to-thickness ratios were fabricated using steel pipes of ultra-high strength and were subjected to compression of external pressure in a sealed pressure vessel specially designed and customized for the experiment. Experimental results were recorded through a data acquisition system. For facilitating the theoretical calculations, uniaxial tensile tests were performed on tensile pieces cut from the same pipes to obtain the material properties. It was found from the experimental results that once a buckle is initiated in a pipe, the external pressure dropped to a specific value called buckle propagation pressure and kept at this level until the whole pipe is flattened into a dog-bone shape. Based on the measured material properties and geometric parameters, theoretical solutions were computed using established ring models and shell model, and finite element predictions were also obtained from ABAQUS software. The efficiency and accuracy of the shell model and finite element model were expounded by comparing various theoretical solutions and numerical predictions with the experimental results.

The dynamic response of the area where the upper and lower tunnels intersect is the strongest. (2) The dynamic response of the tunnel in the upper soil is stronger than that in the lower rock. The difference of dynamic response between two tunnels in the same stratum is small. (3) With the increase of the intersection angle between the upper and lower tunnels, the acceleration and shear force decrease gradually. There is a negative correlation. The exponential function is established to describe the functional relationship between the dynamic response and the angle.

WoS,Numerical Investigation of Propagation of BTEX Compounds in Soil,"BTEX compounds are among the light hydrocarbons of gasoline which have been noticed due to their toxicity and long term damaging effects in the environment. Understanding and prediction of how contaminations propagation are of great importance for designing an appropriate remediation method. In this paper, propagation pattern of BTEX compounds in saturated and unsaturated zones of soil is investigated by the finite element method. To investigate the accuracy and reliability of flow and transport modules of MOFAT software two different numerical analyses have conducted based on experimental and in-situ data and the obtained results have compared to results from previous studies. In the following, effect of physical factors of soil and contamination on the propagation pattern is studied based on flow module. The obtained results show that as soil hydraulic conductivity increases effect of NAPL's physical factors in propagation rate are become more tangible.

However, with the collapse of the orebody in the main sublevel, the ground pressure damage of the extraction structure in the vice sublevel presented some specific characteristics. In order to study the damage evolution mechanism of ground pressure in extraction structure during the process of mining gently dipped orebody, a numerical simulation model was established by using finite difference software FLAC(3D), Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion was adopted in calculation. The stress state of the extraction structure in the vice sublevel after each step was monitored and analyzed separately. The research results show that: undercutting in the main sublevel can aggravate the ground pressure damage of the extraction structure in front of an advancing undercut front in the vice sublevel while undercutting in the main sublevel can reduce the probability of secondary occurrence of ground pressure damage in the vice sublevel.

WoS,Numerical Simulation Study of Stratum Subsidence Induced by Sand Leakage in Tunnel Lining Based on Particle Flow Software,"To obtain the dynamic development process of the stratum subsidence of sandy soil layer induced by the cracks of the tunnel lining, and the formation and dynamic change of soil arch during the process of subsidence, a sily-type sand gushing model was established by the particle flow software (PFC2D). The parameters of sandy soil particles were calibrated by biaxial compression test. Furthermore, the flow pattern of sand in the process of stratum subsidence caused by sand leakage induced by cracks in the tunnel lining, the change of the inter-particle force chain during the formation of the soil arch were simulated. It was shown that when the stratum subsidence induced by the cracks of the tunnel lining occurred, the development process of sand collapse was a dynamic process accompanied by the formation and destruction of soil arches. And the ratio of crack width of lining to particle diameter and the internal friction angle between the sand were important factors of sand collapse disaster in the process of stratum subsidence. The necessary conditions for sand collapse were that the ratio of crack width of lining to particle diameter reached 5.1 and the friction coefficient reached 0.6. With the increase of the width of the sand leakage crack, a stable contact force arch was more and more difficult to be formed.",Stratum subsidence; Sand collapse; Soil arch; The cracks of lining; The particle flow software,"Wang, ZC; Li, GD; Wang, AX; Pan, K",2020.0,Journal,GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,10.1007/s10706-020-01270-0,"[Wang, Zhongchang; Li, Guodong; Wang, Aoxiang; Pan, Ke] Dalian Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Dalian 116028, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,0960-3182,
WoS,Exploring the active compounds of traditional Mongolian medicine in intervention of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) based on molecular docking method,"Objective: This article intends to use molecular docking technology to find potential inhibitors that can respond to COVID-19 from active compounds in Mongolian medicine. Methods: Mongolian medicine with anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects is selected from Mongolian medicine prescription preparations. TCMSP, ETCM database and document mining methods were used to collect active compounds. Swiss TargetPrediction and SuperPred server were used to find targets of compounds with smiles number. Drugbank and Genecard database were used to collect antiviral drug targets. Then the above targets were compared and analyzed to screen out antiviral targets of Mongolia medicine. Metascape database platform was used to enrich and analyze the GO (Gene ontology) annotation and KEGG pathway of the targets. In view of the high homology of gene sequences between SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain and SARS virus, as well as their similarities in pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, we established SARS-CoV-2 S-protein model using Swiss-Model. The ZDOCK protein docking software was applied to dock the S-protein with the human angiotensin ACE2 protein to find out the key amino acids of the binding site. Taking ACE2 as the receptor, the molecular docking between the active ingredients and the target protein was studied by AutoDock molecular docking software. The interaction between ligand and receptor is applied to provide a choice for screening anti-COVID-19 drugs. Results: A total of 253 active components were predicted. Metascape analysis showed that key candidate targets were significantly enriched in multiple pathways related to different toxins. These key candidate targets were mainly derived from phillyrin and chlorogenic acid. Through the protein docking between S-protein and ACE2, it is found that Glu329/Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2 play an important role in the binding process of the two. The results of molecular docking virtual calculation showed that phillyrin and chlorogenic acid could stably combine with Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2, respectively, which hindered the combination between Sprotein and ACE2. Conclusion: Phillyrin and chlorogenic acid can effectively prevent the combination of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and ACE2 at the molecular level.

WoS,Uniaxial Eccentric-Compression Performance Analysis for Double-Plate Connected Concrete-Filled Steel-Tube Composite Columns,"In this study, five double-plate connected concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) composite columns were tested under a uniaxial eccentric compressive load. The test phenomena, load-axial displacement curves, strain analyses, and column curve analyses were examined. The effects of different eccentricities and loading directions were compared with respect to the double-plate connected CFST composite columns under uniaxial eccentric compressive load. ABAQUS 6.14-4 software was used to develop models of the double-plate connected CFST composite columns. Load-axial displacement curves and failure modes obtained from the finite element analysis (FEA) models and tests were compared in this study. The FEA results, which were in good agreement with the test results, can well simulate the uniaxial eccentric compression performance of double-plate connected CFST composite columns. Based on the superposition principle and calculation method of the slenderness ratio as per the Standard for Design of Steel Structures (GB50017-2017), the authors proposed a formula for the stable bearing capacity of the double-plate connected CFST composite columns. In addition, a new theoretical formula for the bearing capacity of the uniaxial eccentric compression specimen was proposed. A comparison between the calculated N-M correlation curves and the test and FEA results indicated that the calculation results exhibited good safety and can provide ideas for engineering design.

WoS,An intelligent video analytics model for abnormal event detection in online surveillance video,"One of the primary tools for monitoring human movement and to prevent unwanted or unintended activities is surveillance camera. Nowadays, security management professional rely heavily on video surveillance to challenge crime and avert negative incidents that impact human society. Large numbers of surveillance camera installations have been increasing dramatically in the private and public sectors to monitor public activities. Video surveillance is one of the most effective methods to guarantee security. Fitting a surveillance camera simply transfers the captured video to security personnel. But the abnormal activities can be identified only by integrating an intelligent system to analyze the videos. Hence, this paper is motivated to design and implement an Intelligent Video Analytics Model (IVAM) also known as Human Object Detection (HOD) method for analyzing and detecting video-based abundant objects and abnormal human activities. IVAM can be deployed along with surveillance cameras in any public places like airport, hospital, shopping malls and railway station to automatically identify any abnormal event.

Furthermore the viscoelastic properties of tubular product are considered to simulate creep deformation of pipe under constant loading. These results indicate that: (1) the maximum vertical displacement and Von Mises stress appear at top of pipe and side of internal surface of pipe, respectively; (2) the viscoelastic properties significantly improve the safety of pipe; (3) even if burial depth does not have significant effect on mechanical characteristics of pipe, there is optimal burial depth; (4) the greater the diameter of conduits, the larger modulus backfilled earth, the more difficult it is to destroy pipe breaks.",Mechanical response; Buried polyethylene pipeline; Influential factors,"Liang, L; Gou, WJ; Tian, DL; Yu, WD",2020.0,Journal,TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC MATERIALS,10.1007/s42341-020-00195-y,"[Liang Li] Chongqing Jianzhu Coll, Chongqing 400072, Peoples R China; [Gou Wen-Jin; Tian Da-Lang; Yu Wen-Da] Chongqing Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Gou Wen-Jin] China Railway Eryuan Engn Grp Co Ltd CREEC, Kunming Survey Design & Res Inst Co Ltd, Kunming 650200, Yunnan, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,1229-7607,
WoS,"Light-cardiogram, a simple technique for heart rate determination in adult zebrafish, Danio rerio","Current techniques for heart rate determination in adult zebrafish require specialist expertise and are often invasive, technically challenging and not readily transferable to other laboratories for routine assessment. Here, we present a simple, noninvasive and inexpensive light-cardiogram technique to assess heart rate and frequency in adult zebrafish. Brightfield microscope paired with a high-resolution camera and ImageJ (an open source software) were employed as core recording and processing platforms respectively. The heart was visualised ventrally and located by juxtaposing an isosceles triangle between the opercula as reference to analyse pixel intensity fluctuations generated by each cardiac cycle to derive heart rate and frequency. Compared to transparent embryos, the cardiograms generated reverse light signal oscillations, with contraction and relaxation of the heart (ventricle) corresponding to reduced and increased pixel intensities respectively.

However, the FD amplitudes between males (0.26 +/- 0.03) and females (0.45 +/- 0.05) were significantly different (P < .05) suggesting sex specific diastolic cardiac outputs. Collectively, the technique can be used to measure heartbeats as well as readily adaptable to record relative cardiac outputs and compare differences between physiological states (e.g. sexes).

The use of AI appears to show significant promise in ER triage in the present. We briefly discuss the emerging effectiveness of AI in the ER imaging setting by looking at some of the products approved by the FDA and finding their way into practice. The FDA approval process to date has focused on applications that affect patient triage and not necessarily ones that have the computer serve as the only or final reader. We describe a select group of applications to provide the reader with a sense of the current state of AI use in the ER setting to assess neurologic, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal trauma indications. In the process, we highlight the benefits of triage staging using AI, such as accelerating diagnosis and optimizing workflow, with few downsides. The ability to triage patients and take care of acute processes such as intracranial bleed, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism will largely benefit the health system, improving patient care and reducing costs. These capabilities are all available now. This first wave of AI applications is not replacing radiologists. Rather, the innovative software is improving throughput, contributing to the timeliness in which radiologists can get to read abnormal scans, and possibly enhances radiologists' accuracy.

WoS,Three dimensional reconstructions of the superior olivary complex from children with autism spectrum disorder,"Auditory dysfunction is a common symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ranges from decreased acuity to hypersensitivity where routine sounds may result in panic or anxiety. Irrespective of altered sensitivity, there is often additional difficulty of listening in background noise. Previous studies of post-mortem brain specimens from subjects with ASD have revealed consistent dysmorphology in the superior olivary complex (SOC). The medial superior olive (MSO) is the largest and most prominent nucleus in the human SOC. Our morphological studies have shown that in subjects with ASD, there are significantly fewer neurons in the MSO and surviving neurons are smaller, more round and have abnormal dendritic orientations. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the SOC in subjects with ASD not only includes fewer neurons but that these nuclei occupy significantly less brain volume and demonstrate abnormal nuclear contours. We investigated this hypothesis by making 3D volume renderings of the SOC nuclei using Amira software. Subjects in this study include three neurotypical and seven age-matched (ages 2-11 years of age) children with ASD. Our 3D reconstructions and volume measurements of the SOC nuclei emphasize the drastic alterations in the size, volume and organization of the human SOC in ASD. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It typically involves massive computing-intensive deconvolution operations that cannot be fitted to conventional neural network processors directly. However, prior works mainly investigated specialized hardware architectures through intensive hardware modifications to the existing deep learning processors to accelerate deconvolution together with the convolution. In contrast, this article proposes a novel deconvolution implementation with a software approach and enables fast and efficient deconvolution execution on the existing deep learning processors. Our proposed method reorganizes the computation of deconvolution and allows the deep learning processors to treat it as the standard convolution by splitting the original deconvolution filters into multiple small filters. Compared to prior acceleration schemes, the implemented acceleration scheme achieves 2.4x -4.3x performance speedup and reduces the energy consumption by 27.7 -54.5 percent on a set of realistic benchmarks.

WoS,HEAWS: An Accelerator for Homomorphic Encryption on the Amazon AWS FPGA,"Homomorphic Encryption makes privacy preserving computing possible in a third party owned cloud by enabling computation on the encrypted data of users. However, software implementations of homomorphic encryption are very slow on general purpose processors. With the emergence of 'FPGAs as a service', hardware-acceleration of computationally heavy workloads in the cloud are getting popular. In this article we propose HEAWS, a domain-specific coprocessor architecture for accelerating homomorphic function evaluation on the encrypted data using high-performance FPGAs available in the Amazon AWS cloud. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report hardware acceleration of homomorphic encryption using Amazon AWS FPGAs. Utilizing the massive size of the AWS FPGAs, we design a high-performance and parallel coprocessor architecture for the FV homomorphic encryption scheme which has become popular for computing exact arithmetic on the encrypted data. We design parallel building blocks and apply pipeline processing at different levels of the implementation hierarchy, and on top of such optimizations we instantiate multiple parallel coprocessors in the FPGA to execute several homomorphic computations simultaneously. While the absolute computation time can be reduced by deploying more computational resources, efficiency of the HW/SW communication interface plays an important role in homomorphic encryption as it is computation as well as data intensive. Our implementation utilizes state of the art 512-bit XDMA feature of high bandwidth communication available in the AWS Shell to reduce the overhead of HW/SW data transfer. Moreover, we explore the design-space to identify optimal off-chip data transfer strategy for feeding the parallel coprocessors in a time-shared manner. As a result of these optimizations, our AWS-based accelerator can perform 613 homomorphic multiplications per second for a parameter set that enables homomorphic computations of depth 4.

Isolation can be achieved with software-based solutions or can be enforced by a hardware level partitioning. An asymmetric multiprocessor architecture offers hardware-based isolation at the cost of underutilized hardware resources, and the inter-core communication mechanism is often a single point of failure in such architectures. In contrast, a partitioned uniprocessor offers efficient resource utilization at the cost of limited scalability. We propose a partitioned real-time asymmetric architecture (PaRTAA) specifically designed for mixed-criticality airborne systems, featuring robust partitioning within processing elements for establishing isolation between tasks with varying criticality. The granularity in the processing element offers efficient resource utilization where inter-dependent tasks share the same processing element for sequential execution while preserving isolation, and independent tasks simultaneously execute on different processing elements as per system requirements.",Task analysis; Hardware; Multicore processing; Real-time systems; Resource management; Aerospace electronics; Avionics on multi-core; mixed-criticality systems; integrated modular avionics; robust resource partitioning; single core equivalence; processor architecture,"Majumder, S; Nielsen, JFD; Bak, T",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS,10.1109/TC.2020.3002697,"[Majumder, Shibarchi; Nielsen, Jens Frederik Dalsgaard; Bak, Thomas] Aalborg Univ, Dept Elect Syst, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,English,0018-9340,
WoS,DS3: A System-Level Domain-Specific System-on-Chip Simulation Framework,"Heterogeneous systems-on-chip (SoCs) are highly favorable computing platforms due to their superior performance and energy efficiency potential compared to homogeneous architectures. They can be further tailored to a specific domain of applications by incorporating processing elements (PEs) that accelerate frequently used kernels in these applications. However, this potential is contingent upon optimizing the SoC for the target domain and utilizing its resources effectively at runtime. To this end, system-level design - including scheduling, power-thermal management algorithms and design space exploration studies - plays a crucial role. This article presents a system-level domain-specific SoC simulation (DS3) framework to address this need. DS3 enables both design space exploration and dynamic resource management for power-performance optimization of domain applications. We showcase DS3 using six real-world applications from wireless communications and radar processing domain. DS3, as well as the reference applications, is shared as open-source software to stimulate research in this area.",Space exploration; Scheduling; Computer architecture; Task analysis; Computational modeling; Analytical models; Scheduling algorithms; Heterogeneous computing; System-on-Chip (SoC); domain-specific SoC; simulation framework; scheduling; dynamic thermal-power management (DTPM); design space exploration,"Arda, SE; Krishnakumar, A; Goksoy, AA; Kumbhare, N; Mack, J; Sartor, AL; Akoglu, A; Marculescu, R; Ogras, UY",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS,10.1109/TC.2020.2986963,"[Arda, Samet E.; Krishnakumar, Anish; Goksoy, A.

WoS,Modeling Blast-Induced Fragmentation of Jointed Rock Mass Using Voronoi Discrete-Element Method,"Pattern design and management of blasting in open pit mining have been constantly of great interest to many mining engineers so as to reach an appropriate degree of fragmentation for loading, hauling, and crushing systems. Inappropriate fragmentation incurs extra costs in the form of secondary blasting, disruptions in the loading and hauling process, and so forth. To tackle this problem, it is necessary to predict the blast-induced fragmentation. Numerous methods have been proposed by many researchers to predict fragmentation. Regarding technological advancements, and with the advent of numerical codes, the restrictions of empirical methods for the prediction of blast-induced fragmentation can be overcome. The present study developed a model for the estimation of blast-induced fragmentation using a discrete-element method coupled with image processing techniques. In the numerical model, Voronoi elements were used to simulate microcracks of rock materials. Preexisting joints were also present in the model; prior to the blasting, their information was elicited in the area of interest (the Hegmatan limestone mine, Iran). After the blasting, the real fragmentation and modeled fragmentation were compared using image processing software. The results obtained from the numerical modeling were in good agreement with the real data, validating the simulation procedure. Hence, the Voronoi discrete-element method coupled with the image processing technique is appropriately capable of modeling the blasting-induced fragmentation in a discontinuum. Finally, the influence of different parameters, namely delay, presplitting, preexisting joints, discontinuity spacing, and spacing-to-burden ratio, on fragmentation indices were numerically simulated and investigated. The results showed that the lack of delay increases D-50 of fragments from 32.57 to 95.94 cm, the application of presplitting negligibly affects fragmentation, and the preexisting joints in the study area enhanced the fragmentation performance.",Rock fragmentation; Production blasting; Discrete-element method; Voronoi elements; Image processing,"Babanouri, N; Abdolahpour, M; Dehghani, H",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS,10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0001743,"[Babanouri, Nima; Abdolahpour, Milad; Dehghani, Hesam] Hamedan Univ Technol, Dept Min Engn, Hamadan 6516913733, Hamadan, Iran",ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,English,1532-3641,
WoS,The DReAM framework for dynamic reconfigurable architecture modelling: theory and applications,"Modern systems evolve in unpredictable environments and have to continuously adapt their behaviour to changing conditions. The DReAM (Dynamic Reconfigurable Architecture Modelling) framework has been designed for modelling reconfigurable dynamic systems. It provides a rule-based language, inspired from Interaction Logic, which is expressive and easy to use encompassing all aspects of dynamicity including parametric multi-modal coordination with creation/deletion of components as well as mobility. Additionally, it allows the description of both endogenous/modular and exogenous/centralized coordination styles and sound transformations from one style to the other. The DReAM framework is implemented in the form of a Java API bundled with an execution engine.

WoS,The scenario coevolution paradigm: adaptive quality assurance for adaptive systems,"Systems are becoming increasingly more adaptive, using techniques like machine learning to enhance their behavior on their own rather than only through human developers programming them. We analyze the impact the advent of these new techniques has on the discipline of rigorous software engineering, especially on the issue of quality assurance. To this end, we provide a general description of the processes related to machine learning and embed them into a formal framework for the analysis of adaptivity, recognizing that to test an adaptive system a new approach to adaptive testing is necessary. We introduce scenario coevolution as a design pattern describing how system and test can work as antagonists in the process of software evolution. While the general pattern applies to large-scale processes (including human developers further augmenting the system), we show all techniques on a smaller-scale example of an agent navigating a simple smart factory. We point out new aspects in software engineering for adaptive systems that may be tackled naturally using scenario coevolution. This work is a substantially extended take on Gabor et al.

WoS,Metagenomic analyses uncover the differential effect of azide treatment on bacterial community structure by enriching a specificCyanobacteriapresent in a saline-alkaline environmental sample,"Treatment of environmental samples under field conditions may require the application of chemical preservatives, although their use sometimes produces changes in the microbial communities. Sodium azide, a commonly used preservative, is known to differentially affect the growth of bacteria. Application of azide and darkness incubation to Isabel soda lake water samples induced changes in the structure of the bacterial community, as assessed by partial 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Untreated water samples (WU) were dominated by gammaproteobacterial sequences accounting for 86%, while in the azide-treated (WA) samples, this group was reduced to 33% abundance, and cyanobacteria-related sequences became dominant with 53%. Shotgun sequencing and genome recruitment analyses pointed toHalomonas campanensisstrain LS21 (genome size 4.07 Mbp) andSynechococcussp. RS9917 (2.58 Mbp) as the higher recruiting genomes from the sequence reads of WA and WU environmental libraries, respectively, covering nearly the complete genomes. Combined treatment of water samples with sodium azide and darkness has proven effective on the selective enrichment of a cyanobacterial group.

WoS,Benzothiazole derivative bearing amide moiety induces p53-mediated apoptosis in HPV16 positive cervical cancer cells,"In our previous study, we screened the anti-cancer properties of 10 benzothiazole derivatives in cervical cancer cell lines. In the present study, we aimed to delineate the mechanism of the apoptotic pathway (whether intrinsic or extrinsic) following the treatment of N-(4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)phenyl)-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzamide (named as A-07) on cervical cancer cell lines. Cellular stress by reactive oxygen species was measured using DCFDA dye by flowcytometry. Protein expression and localization was checked by immunofluorescence for gamma H2A.X, TP53, and CASP-3. Expression profiles of BAX and BCL-2 was done by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and PARP-1 (Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1) by Western blot analysis. Bioinformatic studies were done using PDB websites, metaPocket 2.0 server, YASARA software and Discovery Studio 3.5 Visualizer. We demonstrate that the compound A-07 leads to ROS generation and double strand breaks in SiHa and C-33A cells. The induction of apoptosis in SiHa cells is associated with increased nuclear expression of the tumor suppressor protein, TP53. The shift in BAX/BCL-2 ratio, increased expression of Caspase-3 and cleaved Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 favour apoptotic signal in SiHa. In silico studies revealed that A-07 has inhibiting capabilities to the E6/E6AP/P53 complex.

WoS,Collecting large datasets of rotational electron diffraction with ParallEM and SerialEM,"A semi-automated protocol has been developed for rotational data collection of electron diffraction patterns by combined use of SerialEM and ParallEM, where SerialEM is used for positioning of sample crystals and ParallEM for rotational data collection. ParallEM calls standard camera control software through an AutoIt script, which adapts to software operational changes and to new GUI programs guiding other cameras. Development included periodic flashing and pausing of data collection during overnight or day-long recording with a cold field-emission beam. The protocol proved to be efficient and accurate in data collection of large-scale rotational series from two JEOL electron microscopes, a general-purpose JEM-2100 and a high-end CRYO ARM 300. Efficiency resulted from simpler steps and task specialization.

The present article demonstrates modeling options and specifications for cross-classified data to be used within these different research strands. For more specific demonstration purposes, we use a data set on rater variance in assessment centers. Commonly, raters observe only a subset of participants and hence ratings are both nested in participants and raters, but participants and raters are not nested in each other. Using cross-classified models allows studying sources of rater variance (e.g., professional expertise) and interactions between cluster level variables, for example, interactions between participants' and raters' personality and socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., gender).

WoS,Accuracy of cortical bone trajectory screw placement using patient-specific template guide system,"Cortical bone trajectory (CBT) can facilitate both minimum invasiveness and strong screw fixation; however, ensuring the ideal cortical trajectory is challenging due to the narrow corridor, necessitating high-level surgical skill. A patient-specific template guide for CBT screw placement may be a promising solution to improve accuracy and safety. Little has been reported on the use of a CBT screw guide in clinical practice. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of CBT screw placement using the template guide. This study was a retrospective clinical evaluation of prospectively collected patients. Forty-three consecutively enrolled patients who underwent posterior lumbar spinal fusion using the guide system were included. First, three-dimensional planning of CBT screw placement was performed using computer simulation software. The trajectory was directed in a more anterior position of the vertebral body, compared with the original CBT, and the standard size was set as 5-6 mm in diameter and 40-45 mm in length. Then, screw guides were created for each vertebra preoperatively and used. The safety and accuracy of a total of 198 inserted screws (L1 to L5) were analyzed using postoperative computed tomography by evaluation of pedicle perforation and measurement of screw deviations between the planned and actual screw positions. A total of 193 screws (97.5%) were placed completely inside the pedicle and there was no incidence of neurovascular injuries. The mean screw deviation from the planned trajectory on the coronal plane at the midpoint of the pedicle was 0.62 +/- 0.42 mm, and the mean angular deviations in the sagittal and transverse planes were 1.68 +/- 1.24 degrees and 1.27 +/- 0.77 degrees, respectively. CBT screw placement using a patient-specific template guide was accurate enough for clinical application.

This study aimed to detect magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) texture parameters to predict the molecular signature of LrGGs using a commercially available software and routine MR images. Forty-three patients treated at Keio University Hospital who had World Health Organization grade II or III gliomas were included. All patients having preoperative T1- and T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted (DW) images were also included.

WoS,Generalizing rate heterogeneity across sites in statistical phylogenetics,"Phylogenetics uses alignments of molecular sequence data to learn about evolutionary trees relating species. Along branches, sequence evolution is modelled using a continuous-time Markov process characterized by an instantaneous rate matrix. Early models assumed the same rate matrix governed substitutions at all sites of the alignment, ignoring variation in evolutionary pressures. Substantial improvements in phylogenetic inference and model fit were achieved by augmenting these models with multiplicative random effects that describe the result of variation in selective constraints and allow sites to evolve at different rates which linearly scale a baseline rate matrix. Motivated by this pioneering work, we consider an extension using a quadratic, rather than linear, transformation. The resulting models allow for variation in the selective coefficients of different types of point mutation at a site in addition to variation in selective constraints. We derive properties of the extended models. For certain non-stationary processes, the extension gives a model that allows variation in sequence composition, both across sites and taxa. We adopt a Bayesian approach, describe an MCMC algorithm for posterior inference and provide software.

WoS,Blood biochemical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a systemic review and meta-analysis,"Objectives: Recently, there have been several studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, these studies have mainly been concentrated in Wuhan, China; the sample sizes of each article were different; and the reported clinical characteristics, especially blood biochemical indices, were quite different. This study aimed to summarize the blood biochemistry characteristics of COVID-19 patients by performing a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies. Methods: Comprehensive studies were screened from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through March 11, 2020. The inclusion criteria included studies investigating the biochemical indexes of patients with COVID-19. The statistical software R3.6.3 was used for meta-analysis. Results: Ten studies including 1745 COVID-19 patients met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that 16% and 20% of patients with COVID-19 had alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels higher than the normal range, respectively. Thirty-four percent of patients showed albumin (ALB) levels lower than the normal range, and 6% of patients showed abnormal total bilirubin (TBil) levels. The levels of creatinine (CRE) were increased in 8% of patients. The creatine kinase (CK) level of 13% of patients exceeded the normal range, and 52% of patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In addition, six studies met the inclusion criteria for the systemic review evaluating the relevance between LDH levels and the severity of COVID-19, and all six studies showed a positive association between these two factors. Conclusions: Some patients with COVID-19 had different degrees of blood biochemical abnormalities, which might indicate multiple organ dysfunction. Some biochemical indexes, such as abnormal ALB and LDH, could reflect the severity of the disease to a certain extent.

We have developed a functional software for the measurement of professional competences in order to standardize the procedure and to collect all the data in a single platform, avoiding redundancy and dispersion. Methods: Our model objectively assesses the skills, as they become measurable and comparable with appropriate standards and involves both managers and operators, to increase their active engagement. The assessment concerns everyone, but the standards to be met (numerical values) can vary according to the responsibilities. Several subjective and objective criteria are evaluated: each parameter can contribute in a variable proportion to the total skills measured according to the needs of the organization. Results: The data are automatically analyzed and can be easily monitored in real time in the form of indicators, thanks to dashboards. The comparison between the skills required and those measured allows highlighting the gap useful for planning personalized training paths.

WoS,"Human biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [F-18]DASA-23, a PET probe targeting pyruvate kinase M2","Purpose To assess the safety, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of the novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical 1-((2-fluoro-6-[[F-18]]fluorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperazine ([F-18]DASA-23) in healthy volunteers. Methods We recruited 5 healthy volunteers who provided a written informed consent. Volunteers were injected with 295.0 +/- 8.2 MBq of [F-18]DASA-23 intravenously. Immediately following injection, a dynamic scan of the brain was acquired for 15 min. This was followed by serial whole-body PET/MRI scans acquired up to 3 h post-injection. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals, and vital signs monitored pre- and post-radiotracer administration. Regions of interest were drawn around multiple organs, time-activity curves were calculated, and organ uptake and dosimetry were estimated with OLINDA/EXM (version 1.1) software. Results All subjects tolerated the PET/MRI examination, without adverse reactions to [F-18]DASA-23. [F-18]DASA-23 passively crossed the blood-brain barrier, followed by rapid clearance from the brain. High accumulation of [F-18]DASA-23 was noted in organs such as the gallbladder, liver, small intestine, and urinary bladder, suggesting hepatobiliary and urinary clearance. The effective dose of [F-18]DASA-23 was 23.5 +/- 5.8 mu Sv/MBq. Conclusion We successfully completed a pilot first-in-human study of [F-18]DASA-23. Our results indicate that [F-18]DASA-23 can be used safely in humans to evaluate pyruvate kinase M2 levels.

WoS,How People Visually Represent Discrete Constraint Problems,"Problems such as timetabling or personnel allocation can be modeled and solved using discrete constraint programming languages. However, while existing constraint solving software solves such problems quickly in many cases, these systems involve specialized languages that require significant time and effort to learn and apply. These languages are typically text-based and often difficult to interpret and understand quickly, especially for people without engineering or mathematics backgrounds. Visualization could provide an alternative way to model and understand such problems. Although many visual programming languages exist for procedural languages, visual encoding of problem specifications has not received much attention. Future problem visualization languages could represent problem elements and their constraints unambiguously, but without unnecessary cognitive burdens for those needing to translate their problem's mental representation into diagrams. As a first step towards such languages, we executed a study that catalogs how people represent constraint problems graphically. We studied three groups with different expertise: non-computer scientists, computer scientists and constraint programmers and analyzed their marks on paper (e.g., arrows), gestures (e.g., pointing) and the mappings to problem concepts (e.g., containers, sets). We provide foundations to guide future tool designs allowing people to effectively grasp, model and solve problems through visual representations.",Visualization; Software; Computer languages; Tools; Problem-solving; Problem visualization; problem modeling; problem solving; constraint programming; visual programming languages,"Zhu, X; Nacenta, MA; Akgun, O; Nightingale, P",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2895085,"[Zhu, Xu; Nacenta, Miguel A.; Akgun, Ozgur] Univ St Andrews, Sch Comp Sci, Jack Cole Bldg, St Andrews KY16 9SX, Fife, Scotland; [Nightingale, Peter] Univ York, Dept Comp Sci, Deramore Lane, York YO10 5GH, N Yorkshire, England",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,English,1077-2626,
WoS,Sludge Blanket Height (SBH) as a Process Stability Indicator in UASFF Reactor: Relationship Between SBH and Sludge Concentration at Different Operating Conditions,"Sludge blanket height (SBH) is considered as one of the most significant parameters in design of up flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) bioreactor. The SBH adjusts appropriate sludge concentration inside the bioreactor which subsequently hinders washout phenomenon. In addition, maximum organic loading that the bioreactor can undergo is determined on the basis of this parameter. This study investigates the effects of two independent operating variables, organic loading rate (OLR) and up-flow velocity (V-up), on the SBH and also sludge concentration at different ports (S-1-S-4) of an up-flow anaerobic sludge fixed film (UASFF) bioreactor treating palm oil mill effluent (POME). A central composite face-centered design (CCFD) was employed to design the experiments and nine different conditions at three levels of each variable were determined (3.8, 16.4 and 29.0 g COD/l.d of OLR and 0.2, 1.6 and 3.0 m/h of V-up). The variations of sludge concentration (at S-4) and gas production rate (q) as a function of the variables were analyzed and modeled using response surface methodology (RSM). From the results, simultaneous increase in both variables led to a decrease in the sludge concentration from 2.3 to 1.6 g/l, whereas, the variables showed an increasing trend in the q from 0.09 to 0.37 m(3)/m(2). h. Furthermore, the sludge concentration and the SBH were also modeled using Narnoli and Mehrotra's equation in Sigma Plot Software. The experimental results were well fitted with the model predictions. The changes of the SBH and sludge concentration under different operating conditions were ranged from approximately 0.1-0.7 m and 0-65 g/l, respectively. The experimental and modeling findings also manifested the direct impact of the V(up)on the SBH.",Sludge blanket height; Sludge concentration; Gas production rate; Operating variables; UASFF reactor,"Zinatizadeh, AA; Rahimi, Z; Younesi, H",2020.0,Journal,WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION,10.1007/s12649-019-00708-8,"[Zinatizadeh, A.

WoS,One-Step Conversion of Lemongrass Leaves Hydrolysate to Biovanillin by Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 24725 in Batch Culture,"One-step bioconversion of biovanillin usingPhanerochaete chrysosporiumATCC 24725 with lemongrass leaves hydrolysates (LLH) was performed in batch culture. Initially, optimization of the lignocellulosic pretreatment practices using liquid hot-water with sodium bisulfite (0.5% w/v) towards the release of the ferulic acids was exhaustively investigated. The optimized results using central composite design recovered 0.750 +/- 0.002 g/L of ferulic acid from the LLH. The bioconversion of biovanillin was grossly affected by the interactive effects of initial ferulic acid concentration, incubation temperature, incubation time and initial pH, and the biovanillin production was best determined at 0.5 g/L, 35 degrees C, 72 h, and 6 respectively. Bioconversion with the optimized condition revealed highest biovanillin production (93 +/- 3 mg/L) with molar yield (23%) and acetic acid (12 +/- 4 mg/L). Besides that, the use of the liquid hot water pretreatment approaches has clearly shows its effects on the respective untreated lemongrass leaves composition. Considerable alterations of the major lignocellulose contents were observed from the pretreated lemongrass leaves, which improved the cellulose content with 39%, but a decreased in the extractives, hemicellulose and lignin contents by 23, 29 and 46% were observed respectively. This proven the effectiveness of the pretreatment method in breaking the rigid structure of the lignocelluloses through increasing hemicellulose digestion, which instigates the disruption of lignin wall that resulted into the total loss of the lignocellulose structures. It further revealed that the lignin which serves as the shielding layer became fragmented and resulted to the cellulose exposure and accessible, thus eventually upsurges its contents. The design expert software ultimately revealed that all the optimization model terms were fit and significant statistically. Therefore, the one-step bioconversion usingPhanerochaete chrysosporiumATCC 24725 with LLH as a source of ferulic acid epitomized a fabulous means of biovanillin production under the optimized conditions.

WoS,Integration of multi-sensor analysis and decision tree for evaluation of dual and quad-Pol SAR in L- and C-bands applied for marsh delineation,"Marsh is a wetland type characterized by hydromorphic soils, herbaceous vegetation, aquatic and emergent vegetation; usually, the apparent water surface does not exceed 25% of the area. Multi-polarized active remote sensors with different frequencies have characteristics that make them ideal for mapping and delineating marsh areas since they provide information on canopy roughness, vegetation moisture and amount of biomass. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop a method based on multi-frequency radar satellites images to delineate marsh areas using decision tree classification. In order to reach this objective, we sought to answer the following questions: (1) Are L-band SAR images more efficient for marshes delineation than C-band SAR images? (2) Is multi-sensor (L and C-band) integration more accurate for marsh areas delineation than a single sensor? and (3) What are the most efficient channels for marshes delineation? Our findings showed that L-band images present greater proportion correct (PC) for marshes delineation compared to C-band images. However, the greatest PC was found using integration of Alos Palsar 1 and Sentinel 1 satellites images, reaching more than 72% of correctness. Regarding the polarization importance to Alos Palsar 1 image, HVVH presented the highest importance, with 29%, followed by VH and HV polarizations, both with 28%. For Sentinel 1 image, the most important polarization was VH, with 22%, followed by VV + VH that presented 20%. HVVH polarization was the most important in Alos and Sentinel images integration, with 35%, followed by Alos Palsar HV and VH, with 34 and 33%, respectively. Thus, we concluded that the method based on SAR multi-frequency data integration used in this study can be easily applied by other researchers interested in marsh delineation since the radar images used are freely available and can be processed and manipulated in free GIS software.",Data mining; Hydromorphic soils; Polarization; Wetlands,"Simioni, JPD; Guasselli, LA; Nascimento, VF; Ruiz, LFC; Belloli, TF",2020.0,Journal,ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,10.1007/s10668-019-00442-0,"[Delapasse Simioni, Joao Paulo; Guasselli, Laurindo Antonio; Chimelo Ruiz, Luis Fernando; Belloli, Tassia Fraga] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Res Ctr Remote Sensing & Meteorol, Bento Goncalves Ave 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Nascimento, Victor Fernandez] Earth Syst Sci Ctr, Natl Inst Space Res, Ave Astronautas St 1758, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil",SPRINGER,English,1387-585X,
WoS,Sustainable economic rural development system pattern in Ghaemshahr: an application of the developed TOP-MARD core model,"Attention to rural development is an important and undeniable necessity of regional and national development in any country. As a result, in this study, this issue has been assessed in the villages of Ghaemshahr city of Mazandaran Province in Iran. In this regard, the developed model of TOPMARD Core Model and 382 samples of villagers in Ghaemshahr city have been used. Vensim software has been used to analyze the information. Indicators used in this model include economic, social, environmental, physical, tourism and welfare indicators of villages. Three scenarios of agricultural support, non-agricultural support and environmental education were simulated. The model simulation results for existing conditions indicate that the welfare of villagers is declining over the coming years and the migration process from village to cities are increasing. The results of various policy simulations showed that the implementation of policies to increase the guaranteed price of purchases of agricultural products, increase the input support along with environmental education in order to understand the amount and manner of using fertilizer and pesticide and improvement in infrastructure and physical facilities such as creation, educational, health, cultural and rural infrastructure, including suitable roads for easier and less costly access to the market, as well as the presence of tourists to the villages, can play an important role in improving of the well-being of villagers, reducing poverty gap and reducing migration to the cities.",System dynamic; Sustainable economic development; Ghaemshahr villages; Developed TOP-MARD core model; Physical index; Economic welfare of villagers,"Karmozdi, KM; Kohansal, MR; Ghorbani, M",2020.0,Journal,ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,10.1007/s10668-019-00451-z,"[Karmozdi, Komeil Mahjori; Kohansal, Mohammad Reza; Ghorbani, Mohammad] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Agr, Agr Econ Dept, Azadi Sq, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran",SPRINGER,English,1387-585X,
WoS,Effects of equivalence ratio and CNG addition on engine performance and emissions in a dual sequential ignition engine,"Compared to widening usage of CNG in commercial gasoline engines, insufficient but increasing number of studies have appeared in the open literature during last decades, while engine characteristics need to be quantified in exact numbers for each specific fuel and engine. CNG usage in spark-ignition engine offers many advantages such as high specific power outputs, knock resistance, and low CO(2)emission. Engine performance and emissions are strong functions of equivalence ratio. This study focuses on determination of the effects of equivalence ratio on engine performance and emissions for a unique commercial engine for three fuels of gasoline, CNG, and gasoline-CNG mixture (90%-10%: G9C1). For this aim, the tests and the three-dimensional in-cylinder combustion computational fluid dynamics analyses were employed in quantification of engine characteristics at wide open throttle position. Equivalence ratios were defined between 0.7 and 1.4. The engine's maximum torque speed of 2800 r/min was examined. The tested commercial engine is an intelligent dual sequential ignition engine which has unique features such as diagonally positioned two spark-plugs, dual sequential ignition with variable timing and asymmetrical combustion chamber. This gasoline engine was equipped with an independent CNG port-injection system and a specific engine control unit for CNG. In addition, the engine test system has a concomitant dual fuel delivery system that supplies gas fuel into intake airline while liquid gasoline is injected behind the intake valve. Other than testing the engine, the three-dimensional in-cylinder combustion computational fluid dynamics analyses were performed in Star-CD/es-ice software for the three fuels. The CFD model was built by using renormalization group equations, k-epsilon turbulence model, and G-equation combustion model. Computational fluid dynamics analyses were run for the compression ratio of 10.8:1, equivalence ratio of 1.1, and engine's maximum torque speed of 2800 r/min. Test results show that brake torque for all fuels increases rapidly from the lean blend to the rich blend. The brake-specific fuel consumption for all fuels decreases from phi = 0.7 through the stoichiometric region and then slightly increases up to phi = 1.4. The volumetric efficiencies for three fuels have similar decreasing trend with respect to equivalence ratio. Overall, CNG addition decreases the performance values of torque, brake-specific fuel consumption, volumetric efficiency, brake thermal efficiency, while it decreases emissions of CO2, CO, HC, except NOx. Engine model results show that the maximum in-cylinder pressure is 72 bar at 722 crank angle degree (CAD), 68 bar at 730 CAD, and 60 bar at 735 CAD for gasoline, CNG, and G9C1, respectively. The cumulative heat release for gasoline is 9.09% higher than G9C1, while G9C1 is 15.71% higher than CNG. The CO(2)mass fraction for gasoline is about 22.58% lower than G9C1, while it is 40.32% higher than CNG. The maximum mass fraction value of CO is 0.21, 0.17, and 0.08 for gasoline, CNG, and G9C1, respectively. The CO for G9C1 is overall 60.04% lower than CNG and 67.45% lower than gasoline. At maximum point, HC for G9C1 is 31.43% and 71.43% higher than gasoline and CNG, respectively. CNG has the highest level of NO(x)formation. Maximum NO(x)mass fractions are 0.0098, 0.0070, and 0.0043 for CNG, G9C1, and gasoline, respectively. After the ignition, the flame development is completed at 1.07, 1.18, and 1. 28 ms for gasoline, G9C1, and CNG, respectively. Flame velocities are 28.52, 30.93, and 34.11 m/s for CNG, G9C1, and gasoline, respectively, at 2800 r/min and phi = 1.1. When the time between ignition moment and top dead center moment is considered, the increment rate of flame center temperature is 904.19, 884.10, and 861.77 K/s for CNG, gasoline, and G9C1, respectively. The highest temperature increment rate occurs for CNG.",Intelligent dual sequential ignition engine; equivalence ratio; gasoline; CNG; gasoline-CNG mixture; engine test; engine model; three-dimensional in-cylinder combustion computational fluid dynamics analysis; engine performance; emissions,"Yontar, AA; Dogu, Y",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH,10.1177/1468087419834190,"[Yontar, Ahmet Alper] Tarsus Univ, Fac Technol, Dept Automot Engn, TR-33400 Tarsus, Mersin, Turkey; [Dogu, Yahya] Kirikkale Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Fac Engn, Kirikkale, Turkey",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,English,1468-0874,
WoS,Design and Operation of the ATLAS Transient Science Server,"The Asteroid Terrestrial impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) system consists of two 0.5 m Schmidt telescopes with cameras covering 29 square degrees at plate scale of 1.86 arcsec per pixel. Working in tandem, the telescopes routinely survey the whole sky visible from Hawaii (above delta > -50 degrees) every two nights, exposing four times per night, typically reaching o < 19 magnitude per exposure when the moon is illuminated and c < 19.5 magnitude per exposure in dark skies. Construction is underway of two further units to be sited in Chile and South Africa which will result in an all-sky daily cadence from 2021. Initially designed for detecting potentially hazardous near earth objects, the ATLAS data enable a range of astrophysical time domain science. To extract transients from the data stream requires a computing system to process the data, assimilate detections in time and space and associate them with known astrophysical sources. Here we describe the hardware and software infrastructure to produce a stream of clean, real, astrophysical transients in real time. This involves machine learning and boosted decision tree algorithms to identify extragalactic and Galactic transients. Typically we detect 10-15 supernova candidates per night which we immediately announce publicly. The ATLAS discoveries not only enable rapid follow-up of interesting sources but will provide complete statistical samples within the local volume of 100 Mpc. A simple comparison of the detected supernova rate within 100 Mpc, with no corrections for completeness, is already significantly higher (factor 1.5 to 2) than the current accepted rates.",surveys; minor planets; asteroids; supernovae; variable stars,"Smith, KW; Smartt, SJ; Young, DR; Tonry, JL; Denneau, L; Flewelling, H; Heinze, AN; Weiland, HJ; Stalder, B; Rest, A; Stubbs, CW; Anderson, JP; Chen, TW; Clark, P; Do, A; Forster, F; Fulton, M; Gillanders, J; McBrien, OR; O'Neill, D; Srivastav, S; Wright, DE",2020.0,Journal,PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC,10.1088/1538-3873/ab936e,"[Smith, K.

WoS,Tabular-expression-based method for constructing metamorphic relations,"Metamorphic testing (MT) is proposed to overcome the oracle problem in software testing, and metamorphic relations (MRs) are the core of MT. There is a lack of guidelines for constructing effective MRs, and it is difficult to reuse MRs mainly because most MRs are closely related to the domain knowledge. In this article, we propose a method for constructing MRs from specifications in tabular expression format. Our method constructs MRs according to the characteristics of tabular expressions, especially the relationships between the header grids and the main grid, namely, our method is domain-independent and the construction process is simplified. In addition, the derived MRs can be applied to specifications with the same tabular expression structure. For specifications with different tabular expression structures, MRs can still be used after slight adjustments. To evaluate the performance of our method in practice, we apply the method to five applications. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective for a program with the oracle problem, and that it is applicable to tabular expressions in various formats. Compared with representative testing methods, our method identifies errors that are not detected by the compared methods. Hence, our method and existing methods can complement each other.

WoS,Design of a Novel Multi Epitope-Based Vaccine for Pandemic Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) by Vaccinomics and Probable Prevention Strategy against Avenging Zoonotics,"The emergence and rapid expansion of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) require the development of effective countermeasures especially a vaccine to provide active acquired immunity against the virus. This study pre- sented a comprehensive vaccinomics approach applied to the complete protein data published so far in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) coronavirus data hub. We identified non-structural protein 8 (Nsp8), 3C -like proteinase, and spike glycoprotein as potential targets for immune responses to COVID- 19. Epitopes prediction illustrated both B -cell and T -cell epitopes associated with the mentioned proteins. The shared B and T -cell epitopes: DRDAAMQRK and QARSEDKRA of Nsp8, EDMLNPNYEDL and EFTPFDVVR of 3C - like proteinase, and VNNSYECDIPI of the spike glycoprotein are regions of high potential interest and have a high likelihood of being recognized by the human immune system. The vaccine construct of the epitopes shows stimulation of robust primary immune responses and high level of interferon gamma. Also, the construct has the best conformation with respect to the tested innate immune receptors involving vigorous molecular mechanics and solvation energy.

WoS,Pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence study of new S-1 capsule in Chinese cancer patients,"S-1 is a multicomponent capsule containing tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium that has shown anticancer activity against numerous tumor types. However, S-1 capsules from different manufacturing companies have shown variations in pharmacokinetics and safety. Therefore, this multicenter, single -dose, randomized -sequence, open -label, two-way, self -crossover study was conducted to evaluate the bioequivalence of a newly developed generic S-1 (New Times Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shandong, China) and the original brand -name S-1 capsule (Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan). Furthermore, the safety profiles of both products were compared. A total of 70 patients with 18 types cancer including breast, lung, gastric, and colorectal recruited at 5 hospitals who were randomly and alternatively administered 50 mg of the reference and test S-1 with a 7 -day interval. Plasma concentrations of tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP), oteracil potassium, and 5-fluorour- acil were detected using liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum drug concentration (C-max), time to achieve C max (T-max), half-life ( t(1/2), area under the concentration -time curve from 0-time t (AUC(0-t)), and AUC from 0-infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) were determined using non -compartmental analysis with DAS2.0 software. Bioequivalence of the reference and test S-1 was evaluated according to 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for ratios of AUC and C-max of S-1. Adverse events were evaluated by monitoring symptoms, physical and laboratory examinations, electrocardiogram, and subject interviews. No significant difference was observed in plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic profiles of te- gafur, CDHP, oteracil potassium, or 5-fluorouracil (p 0.05) among cancer patients treated with the reference or test S-1 formulation. The 90% CIs of C-max , AUC(0-t) , and AUC(0-infinity) ratios were within the 80%-125% limit. The generic S-1 caused eight mild adverse events including liver dysfunction, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, abnormal blood electrolytes, hyperglycemia, and dermal toxicity. Similarly, 18 mild adverse events were observed in- cluding dysarteriotony, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, fever, hematotoxicity, abnormal blood electrolytes, hy- perglycemia, dermal toxicity, and joint pain. There were no differences in the adverse event incidence between the two formulations. In conclusion, the newly developed generic S-1 showed similar pharmacokinetics to those of an original brand -name S-1 in cancer patients, thereby indicating bioequivalence.

WoS,Physiologically based pharmacokinetic model outputs depend on dissolution data and their input: Case examples glibenclamide and dipyridamole,"A plethora of dissolution tests exists for oral dosage forms, with variations in selection of the dissolution medium, the hydrodynamics and the dissolution equipment. This work aimed at determining the influence of media composition, the type of dissolution test and the method for entering the data into a PBPK model on the ability to simulate the in vivo plasma profile of an immediate release formulation. Using two rDCS IIa substances, glibenclamide and dipyridamole, housed in immediate -release formulations as model dosage forms, dissolution tests were performed in USP apparatus II with the biorelevant media FaSSGF, FaSSIF V1, V2 and V3 using both single -stage and two -stage test designs. The results were then integrated into the PBPK software Simcyp ? either as the observed release profile (dissolution rate model, DRM) or using a semi - mechanistic model (diffusion layer model, DLM) and compared with in vivo plasma profiles. The selection of the FaSSIF version did not appear to have any relevant influence on the dissolution of the weakly basic dipyridamole, while the weakly acidic glibenclamide was sensitive to the difference in pH between FaSSIF V1, V2 and FaSSIF V3. Since both compounds have pKa values close to the pH of biorelevant media representing conditions in the small intestine, these results may be specific to compounds with similar ionization behavior. Single -stage and two -stage testing led to equivalent simulations for glibenclamide. Only results from the single -stage test in FaSSGF led to a close simulation of the pharmacokinetic profile of dipyridamole when data were inputted using the DRM, while simulations from two -stage testing were most similar to the observed pharmacokinetic profile when DLM with selection of a dynamic pH profile in the small intestine was selected as the data input method. These results emphasize the importance of data input to the simulation results.",FaSSIF; rDCS; Glibenclamide; Dipyridamole; PBPK; Simcyp; Two-stage testing,"Klumpp, L; Dressman, J",2020.0,Journal,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES,10.1016/j.ejps.2020.105380,"[Dressman, Jennifer] Goethe Univ, Inst Pharmaceut Technol, Frankfurt, Germany; Fraunhofer Inst Mol Biol & Appl Ecol IME, Div Translat Med & Pharmacol TMP, Frankfurt, Germany",ELSEVIER,English,0928-0987,
WoS,Pyridine and quinoline molecules as crucial protagonists in the never-stopping discovery of new agents against tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) disease remains to be an alarming infection worldwide with nearly 1.6 million deaths per year ranking above HIV/AIDS. Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), which causes TB, was identified more than 130 years ago, nowadays only old vaccine (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine) and classical toxic drugs that are losing its effectiveness are available in clinic practice. Despite enormous efforts in drug research on TB treatment including vaccines and diagnostics investigations, this old contagious, infectious disease is still a major public health problem. The goal of elimination of epidemic TB disease by 2035 will not be achieved without combined strategies based on faster diagnostic tools, effective vaccines and drugs. In the field of TB chemotherapy, novel molecular design of new compounds able to efficiently kill Mtb via a disruption of new diverse biological targets is evidently required. In this sense, pyridine and quinoline compounds stand out as promising molecules against drug -resistant tuberculosis. Indeed, many candidate drugs based on heterocyclic skeletons are currently being tested. Among them, quinoline derivatives like gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and bedaquiline (sirturo), and pyridine molecules such as sudoterb and agent BRD-8000.3 have been shown to have high potential for more effective treatment of the drug -resistant forms of TB disease.

WoS,High Speed EIT With Multifrequency Excitation Using FPGA and Response Analysis Using FDM,"The investigation of quickly-evolving flow patterns in high-pressure and high-temperature flow rigs is crucial due to inherent hazards. There is a dire need for a high-speed, non-intrusive imaging technique to identify characteristic flow phenomena to alleviate these hazards. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) enables reconstruction of the admittivity distribution of the flowing medium(s), facilitating the characterisation of its/their flow. The requirement for images at high frame-rates led to simultaneous voltage excitations over electrodes on the periphery of the flow associated to Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), doped ONe Excitation for Simultaneous High-speed Operation Tomography (ONE-SHOT) method. In previous studies, we have demonstrated the possibility of the full implementation of simultaneous excitations and measurements strategies for EIT, which maximise the number of measurements for 16 electrodes. This article presents the details of the proposed method and the signal generation/acquisition firmware based on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) data acquisition system focusing on hardware and software integration and the signal processing involved in realising the ONE-SHOT operation of the EIT. It is shown that the simultaneously generated signals are successfully discriminated and used for image reconstruction, at a rate up to 3906 frames per second (fps).

WoS,SmartVLC: Co-Designing Smart Lighting and Communication for Visible Light Networks,"Visible Light Communication (VLC) based on LEDs has been a hot topic investigated for over a decade. However, most of the research efforts assume the intensity of LED light is constant. This hypothesis is not true when Smart Lighting is introduced to VLC, which requires LEDs to adapt their brightness based on the intensity of natural ambient light. Smart lighting saves power consumption and improves user comfort. However, intensity adaptation severely affects the throughput performance of data communication. In this paper, we propose SmartVLC, a system that can maximize the throughput (benefit communication) while still maintaining the LEDs' illumination function (benefit smart lighting). A novel Adaptive Multiple Pulse Position Modulation (AMPPM) scheme is proposed to support fine-grained dimming levels to avoid flickering while maximizing the throughput under each dimming level. SmartVLC is implemented on off-the-shelf commodity hardware. Several real-life challenges in both hardware and software are addressed to make it a robust real-time system. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the system performance under multifaceted scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartVLC supports a communication distance up to 3.6m, and improves the throughput achieved with two state-of-the-art approaches by 40 and 12 percent on average, respectively, without bringing any flickering to users.",Lighting; Light emitting diodes; Throughput; Encoding; Brightness; Modulation; Hardware; Visible light communication; illumination; flickering-free; AMPPM; system design; implementation; evaluation,"Wu, HJ; Wang, Q; Xiong, J; Zuniga, M",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING,10.1109/TMC.2019.2915220,"[Wu, Hongjia] Simula Res Lab, N-1364 Fornebu, Norway; [Wang, Qing] Katholieke Univ Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Xiong, Jie] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Zuniga, Marco] Delft Univ Technol, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,English,1536-1233,

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality in burn patients. Methodology and participants: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 80 patients admitted to burn ward were enrolled using convenient sampling and randomly assigned to one of the experimental or control groups. In the experimental group, patients were intervened using Jacobson's relaxation technique 20-30 min daily for three consecutive days. During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment. Patients' anxiety and their sleep quality were measured and recorded before and after the intervention using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and St Mary's Hospital Sleep Quality Questionnaire (SMHSQ) respectively. Eventually, data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). Results: The findings of the present study showed a statistically significant decrease in anxiety and improvement in sleep quality in the experimental group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Relaxation as a complementary method can be used along with modern medicine to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in burn patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

WoS,Study on conductivity properties and stability of NbAs based on first-principles,"The properties of Weyl material NbAs are studied based on first principles in this paper. Firstly, the Visualizer module of Material Studio software is used to construct NbAs single-layer nanotube and nanobelt, and then CASTEP module is used to optimize and calculate the band structure, density of states and conductivity curves. The energy band, density of states and conductivity curves of carbon nanotube and nanobelt are compared. The results show that the energy band structure of NbAs has conduction band and valence band crossing at Fermi energy level, which shows obvious metallicity and is more conductive than graphene. Secondly, DMOL3 package is used to calculate and analyze the energy band and state density of NbAs nano-ribbon after adding positive and negative voltage along the armchair direction and zigzag direction, respectively. The results show that the valence band of NbAs nanobelt decreases when positive voltage is applied along the direction of the armchair, while increases when negative voltage is applied. When the voltage is applied at 0.05a.u., the peak values of the distribution curve of density of states increase from about 30 eV to 800 eV, and the peak values of the electron density of states increase significantly. When voltage is applied along the zigzag direction, either positive or negative voltage will cause the valence band to move down. When the negative voltage is -0.10a.u., the peak values of the density of states change obviously. Finally, the stability of NbAs is calculated and analyzed. It is found that NbAs nanobelt meet the requirement of stability of elastic modulus of hexagonal crystal system, but have weak shear resistance in plane (001). This indicates that the structure of NbAs is layered, similar to graphene, which is easier to be separated and detached in layers. This study can provide certain theoretical basis for our future experimental exploration of NbAs material properties.",NbAs; First principle; Conductivity; Stability,"Tang, TY; Liu, Y; Diao, XF; Tang, YL",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE,10.1016/j.commatsci.2020.109731,"[Tang, Tian-yu; Liu, Yun; Diao, Xin-feng; Tang, Yan-lin] Guizhou Univ, Coll Phys, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yun] Guizhou Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Guiyang, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER,English,0927-0256,
WoS,A novel study evaluation strategy in the systematic review of animal toxicology studies for human health assessments of environmental chemicals,"A key aspect of the systematic review process is study evaluation to understand the strengths and weaknesses of individual studies included in the review. The present manuscript describes the process currently being used by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program to evaluate animal toxicity studies, illustrated by application to the recent systematic reviews of two phthalates: diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP). The IRIS Program uses a domain-based approach that was developed after careful consideration of tools used by others to evaluate experimental animal studies in toxicology and pre-clinical research. Standard practice is to have studies evaluated by at least two independent reviewers for aspects related to reporting quality, risk of bias/internal validity (e.g., randomization, blinding at outcome assessment, methods used to expose animals and assess outcomes, etc.), and sensitivity to identify factors that may limit the ability of a study to detect a true effect. To promote consistency across raters, prompting con- siderations and example responses are provided to reviewers, and a pilot phase is conducted. The evaluation process is performed separately for each outcome reported in a study, as the utility of a study may vary for different outcomes. Input from subject matter experts is used to identify chemical- and outcome-specific considerations (e.g., lifestage of exposure and outcome assessment when considering reproductive effects) to guide judgments within particular evaluation domains. For each evaluation domain, reviewers reach a consensus on a rating of Good , Adequate , De ficient , or Critically De ficient . These individual domain ratings are then used to determine the overall confidence in the study (High Con fidence , Medium Con fidence , Low Con fidence , or De ficient ). Study evaluation results, including the justifications for reviewer judgements, are documented and made publicly available in EPA's version of Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC), a free and open source web-based software application.

WoS,Improving the Accuracy of Battery-Free Multiturn Absolute Magnetic Encoders by Using a Self-Referencing Lookup Table Algorithm,"This article presents a self-referencing lookup table (LUT) algorithm to enhance the multiturn accuracy of a battery-free multiturn absolute magnetic encoder. The encoder consists of a single-turn angle for the measurement of the degree of rotation within 2 pi using a multipolar magnet to achieve high resolution and a multiturn counter to monitor the total number of revolutions made by the encoder's shaft through the different angles of the four bipolar magnets (BPMs) based on four-shaft gears. However, the signals from the BPMs are affected by factors, such as amplitude mismatch, dc offsets, random noises, and harmonic components that are as a result of electrical and mechanical distortions. To solve this problem, this article suggested a method derived from the single-turn angle and the raw signals from the BPMs to generate the LUTs for multiturn angles. These angles eliminate the effects of the disturbances. Additionally, a multiturn compensation algorithm is suggested to compensate for the number of revolutions made by the encoder. The proposed methods are simulated in MATLAB software and implemented in ARM STM32F407ZG.

WoS,MHD mixed convection in a chamfered lid-driven cavity with partial heating,"In this study, MHD mixed convection lid-driven cavity problem is investigated to find thermal effects of chamfer on the corner of the cavity. For this purpose, open source CFD software, OpenFOAM's existing solver is modified to add Lorentz Force to the momentum equation. Simulation parameters consist of different Richardson numbers (0.01 <= Ri <= 100), Hartmann numbers (0 <= Ha <= 75), magnetic field angle values (0 degrees <= gamma <= 90 degrees), different chamfer radii (0.1 <= r * <= 0.3) and Lid Motion Direction (LMD) as positive and negative. The square cavity is partially heated from the bottom plate covering 40% of its length and the rest of the bottom plate is considered as adiabatic along with the side walls. Top plate an isothermal moving lid and its temperature is lower than the bottom plate. It is observed that chamfer presence can increase the heat transfer but effectiveness of chamfer is limited and dependent on the size of corner vortices and chamfer radius. For a square cavity, only 0.39% increase in the average Nusselt number is obtained at maximum. If there is no corner vortex, chamfer can also block the main stream and decrease heat transfer up to 11%. Lid motion direction can increase the effectiveness of the chamfer, depending on the corner vortex size and at gamma = 45 degrees, reverse lid motion direction increases average Nusselt number up to 57.2% compared to the positive lid motion direction.

Methods: The electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Cochrane central, and Google Scholar internet were searched updated on Jan 30, 2020. Evaluated outcomes included rate of complete ulcer healing, time to healing and adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed with RevMan 5.0 software and STATA 10.0 software. Results: Ten RCTs with 456 patients were included in this study. The meta-analysis showed a higher complete ulcer healing rate (RR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65, P = 0.01, I-2 = 57%), a shorter healing time (MD = -23.42, 95% CI -3733 to -9.51, P = 0.01, I-2 = 78%), with no increasing the incidence of adverse events (RR = 0.48, 95% CI 022 to 1.05, P = 0.75,I-2 = 0%) in PRP group compared with control. Mixed evidence was seen for publication bias, but analyses by using the trim-and-fill method did not appreciably alter results. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that autologous PRP may improve the complete ulcer healing rate, shorten the healing time, with no increasing the incidence of adverse events. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,Modeling cyber-physical systems - aGliderAgent3.0 perspective,"Eight years ago we have designed and implemented an initial prototype of an agent-based glider pilot support system (theGliderAgent). Our aim was to validate correctness of the initial assumption that an agent-based system, combined with sensor data, can help pilots in various situations that occur during a flight. For instance, theGliderAgentwas capable of detecting certain dangers, warn the pilot and, autonomously, send notification(s) to the ground station. Due to the continuous and rapid development of mobile technologies and sensors, our initial prototype has evolved. First, we moved the system, from an emulated environment, to real devices. Second, a semantic-rule-based decision making system was integrated with theGliderAgent, to analyze feeds from sensors (altitude, temperature, blood pressure, etc.) and, based on received information, to trigger appropriate behaviors. The result of our work provided a foundations for development of a general-purpose, cyber-physical system framework, which will be described in this paper. Furthermore, the developed system illustrates an interesting approach to integration of heterogeneous IoT devices (potentially also IoT platforms).",Software agents; Decision support system; JADE; Android; Anomaly detection; Cyber-physical systems,"Mesjasz, MM; Ganzha, M; Paprzycki, M",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,10.1007/s10844-019-00588-3,"[Mesjasz, Mariusz Marek; Ganzha, Maria; Paprzycki, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Syst Res Inst, Newelska 6, PL-01447 Warsaw, Poland",SPRINGER,English,0925-9902,
WoS,Development of a low stress RF MEMS double-cantilever shunt capacitive switch,"In this paper, a novel RF MEMS shunt capacitive switch with application in the Ka frequency band is proposed. The spring design and the step structure added to the beam succeeded in improving the performance of the switch and reducing the stress which results in extended life-time of the switch. Also, by optimally reducing the gap between the dielectric and the beam (without problems such as self-actuation), the actuation voltage of the switch is significantly reduced. Electromechanical and scattering parameters analysis have been done by using COMSOL Multiphysics and HFSS software, respectively. The actuation voltage of the proposed device is 9.2 V. Since the aluminum has a lower mass compared to gold, an aluminum beam has been used in the switch. Desirable scattering parameters at the resonance frequency of 33.5 GHz have been obtained which include insertion loss of - 0.3 dB and return loss of - 18 dB. The high isolation of - 57 dB verifies the improved performance of the switch. Finally, as another innovation in this paper, the effect of inductor and capacitor presence in the input of transmission line is investigated. This analysis has been done by using ADS. Results of the circuit analysis presented in this paper, help the MEMS switch designers to understand the realistic switch behavior before fabrication which considerably saves cost and time.",,"Ansari, HR; Kordrostami, Z",2020.0,Journal,MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS,10.1007/s00542-020-04838-1,"[Ansari, Hamid Reza; Kordrostami, Zoheir] Shiraz Univ Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Shiraz, Iran",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,0946-7076,
WoS,"3D Structural, Facies and Petrophysical Modeling of C Member of Six Hills Formation, Komombo Basin, Upper Egypt","Two main reservoirs are producing in Komombo Basin: the first one belongs to the C Member of the Six Hills Formation, and the second belongs to the Albian/Cenomanian cycle. The C Member reservoir lacks detailed studies. Therefore, a detailed study of this reservoir is needed. 3D geological reservoir modeling of the C Member reservoir can be a pertinent part of an overall strategy for the development of hydrocarbon fields in Komombo Basin. Five boreholes, three vertical seismic profiles and twenty 2D seismic reflection sections are integrated in Petrel (TM) modeling software for building 3D structural, facies and petrophysical models for the C Member reservoir. The constructed 3D structural model reveals the presence of two normal faults, in NW-SE and NE-SW directions. A detailed petrophysical evaluation was performed for the available wells. The resulted facies/petrophysical parameters are then used as input in the processes of facies and petrophysical modeling. The C Member reservoir exhibits thickness values ranging from about 91.5 to 426.5 m. The constructed 3D facies model of the studied reservoir depicts that the shale beds have the large probability distribution in the study area with the comparison of the sandstone and siltstone beds. The created 3D petrophysical models reveal that the C Member reservoir has a fair reservoir quality.

WoS,The effect of high-performance fiber-reinforced cementitious composites on the lateral behavior of reinforced concrete frames without seismic details,"In areas with high seismicity, the construction of reinforced concrete structures with high ductility requires observance of the special seismic specifications of the ACI 318 regulations. This will increase the congestion of transverse reinforcement in the beam-column joints, and this reinforcement congestion in the joints in turn will bring along problems in the construction and concreting. In this study, the use of high-performance fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (HPFRCC) in the joints of frames has been investigated in order to prevent the congestion of the transverse reinforcement in beam-column joints. First, four half-scale exterior beam-column joints were tested under incremental cyclic lateral loading. The tested specimens consisted of two conventional concrete control specimens with and without seismic details and two HPFRCC specimens. Second, physical models for conventional concrete and HPFRCC joints were proposed. Third, verification was performed using experimental results. Then, 5 and 10-story frames including two conventional control frames with and without seismic details and two HPFRCC frames without seismic details are developed by assembling these physical models with OpenSees software. Using nonlinear analyses, the ductility ratio, energy dissipation capacity as well as the cyclic behavior of the frames are examined and compared. The results show that the use of HPFRCC in beam-column joints of frames without seismic details increases the shear strength of joints, the relocation of plastic hinge to the outside of the joint core and the improvement of lateral behavior. The proposed method also shows a significant improvement in seismic parameters such as strength, stiffness, energy dissipation and ductility capacity.",High-performance fiber-reinforced; cementitious composites; Beam-column joints; Seismic details; Reinforced concrete frames; Nonlinear static analysis,"Saghafi, MH; Golafshar, A; Zareian, MS; Kashani, M",2020.0,Journal,STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.istruc.2020.05.012,"[Saghafi, Mohammad Hossein; Golafshar, Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Semnan Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Semnan, Iran; [Zareian, Mohammad Sajjad] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Civil Engn, POB 91775-1111, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Kashani, Mohammad] Islamic Azad Univ, Varamin Pishva Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Varamin, Iran",ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,English,2352-0124,
WoS,PATHOLOGIC HEPATIC CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASOUND PATTERN IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION,"Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a severe complication of allogeneic stemcell transplantation (allo-SCT). Its diagnosis is difficult, and ultrasound (US) has not been proven to be of additional diagnostic value. In the work described here, we prospectively analyzed the hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) pattern before and after allo-SCT and correlated these results with the pre-allo-SCT VOD risk factors, clinical VOD findings and conventional US findings. Thirty consecutive patients who underwent allo-SCT and had at least one VOD risk factor were studied. B-Mode US and CEUS were longitudinally performed at defined time points before and after allo-SCT. The 1-min hepatic enhancement (OMHE) in CEUS was standardized to splenic enhancement and quantified using optical density (OD) measurement software. A hypo-OMHE was arbitrarily defined as pathologic (pOMHE) if the OD of the liver was less than 90% compared with the mean splenic OD. Twenty-one patients (70%) had a pOMHE, the occurrence of which peaked at day 10 after allo-SCT. The number of pre-treatment VOD risk factors significantly differed between the pathologic and non-pathologic OD groups. Together, patients undergoing alloSCT frequently exhibit a pathologic hepatic CEUS pattern, which can be quantified by OD measurement and is suggestive of pre-clinical VOD or other hepatic pathologies.

WoS,Aerodynamic performance change of exhaust passage in steam turbine under low-load conditions,"The exhaust passage is a passage which connect the exhaust port of steam turbine to the inlet of condenser. With the increase of new energy power generation, the coal-fired power units of greater capacity are demanded to participate in peak load regulation, so the steam turbine usually operates under low-load conditions. However, there are lack of literatures that comprehensive analysis aerodynamic performance of exhaust passage under low-load conditions. So in this paper, an exhaust passage coupling with the whole last-stage was numerically simulated by CFX software. The k-omega SST turbulence model and phase transformation model considering the spontaneous condensation flow of wet steam were used. The results show that the inlet swirl flow intensity of exhaust passage increases with the decrease of load. At the 10% turbine heat acceptance(THA) condition, the swirl angle which is more than 90 degrees hold the range of 0% - 64% in blade height. Under low-load conditions, there are six different types of reverse vortices increasing the energy loss of exhaust passage. The total pressure drop of exhaust passage reaches to the maximum of 1671.24 Pa at 10% THA condition. Below the 50%THA condition, the static pressure recovery coefficient cannot be used as the indicator for evaluating the aerodynamic performance of exhaust passage. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,In silico modeling of functionalized poly(methylvinyl ether/maleic acid) for controlled drug release in the ocular milieu,"Controlling structurally defined properties of drug-bound macromolecules such as surface adhesion and interaction with endogenous proteins in the surrounding environment using prior data from computer-assisted simulation can be of great use in designing controlled release macromolecular therapeutic systems. In this paper, we describe experimental correlation of real-time properties of a polymer with pendant drug molecules, with predicted values obtained from studying in silico molecular interactions of this polymer with ocular surface proteins (mucin) for formulating an ophthalmic in situ gel. Mucoretention of the drug (norfloxacin) within the eye sac is closely associated with binding interactions occurring on the ocular surface, and covalent association of the drug with the mucoadhesive polymer, poly(methylvinyl ether/maleic acid), can largely reduce dosing frequency eliciting prolonged antibacterial action much required in treating conjunctival infections. The physicochemical properties and 3D conformation of the drug-polymer conjugate were predicted by computational studies. Molecular docking of the drug-polymer conjugate with ocular surface mucin (MUC-1) suggested that amino acid residues Arg1095, Asn1091, and Gln1070 of mucin are involved in hydrogen bonding with carboxyl residues in the polymer structure. The orientation of the drug-polymer conjugate in solution profoundly depends on the properties of the drug. The studies further reveal that molecular interactions of MUC-1 with the drug in the drug-polymer conjugate influence the binding orientation of the drug-polymer to mucin. Computationally predicted solvation energies revealed a significant difference in energy values between drug molecule alone (- 113.04 kcal/mol) and the drug-polymer (- 492.44 kcal/mol) suggesting higher aqueous solvation of the drug-polymer conjugate compared with less-soluble drug, and that interactions between polymer chains and ocular aqueous environment dictate the drug-polymer conjugate's free energy. Our results demonstrate the fabrication of a macromolecular therapeutic gel using drug-polymer with controlled release properties and mucoadhesion guided by information predicted from computational software. Notably, in silico studies reveal that even small variations in molecular composition, in this case, an antibacterial drug that contributes less than half of the entire molecular weight can considerably change the drug's presentation to the ocular environment.

WoS,AUTOMATIC RECOMMENDATION OF DESIGN PATTERNS BASED ON PATTERNS' INTENT,"The gang-of-four (GoF) patterns provide best practices and reusable solutions to recurrent problems in object-oriented software design. We propose an automatic approach for ranking and recommending GoF patterns. Design-pattern vectors, representing the GoF patterns in terms of the problem types they address, are constructed based on the design pattern intent ontology (DPIO) developed by Kampffmeyer. An input design problem is represented as an input-problem vector, constructed by matching terms extracted from its description with constraints and concepts characterizing problem types in the DPIO. Patterns are ranked and recommended based on similarity scores computed between the design-pattern vectors and the input-problem vector. The proposed method was evaluated on a collection of 36 design problems. With appropriate parameter setting, the actual answers to 69.44% and 83.33% of the problems were recommended within the top-3 and top-5 ranks, respectively. With additional term correspondences for improvement of term matching, the results were increased to 75.00% and 88.89% for the top-3 and top-5 ranks, respectively.

WoS,Influence of intra-yarn flows on whole 3D woven fabric numerical permeability: from Stokes to Stokes-Darcy simulations,"2D and 3D numerical permeability of fibrous media are studied based on Stokes and Stokes-Darcy flows simulated by a Finite Element Modelling (FEM). A monolithic approach stabilised by an Algebraic Sub-Grid Scale (ASGS) method and implemented in a FEM software (Z-set) is used. The 2D geometries have been generated according to ideal arrangements and 3D geometry are representative of a highly anisotropic ply-to-ply interlock unit cell. For both geometries, yarns have been first considered as impermeable, and then the same calculations have been conducted with various intra-yarn permeabilities. The main novelty of this work is to address the dual-scale permeability problem with a Stokes-Darcy modelling so as to override numerical strategy robustness issues. An empirical law has been proposed to link the effective permeability to the intra-yarn one: this allows to generalise previously established results to real 3D materials with complex structures. An intra-yarn permeability threshold (asymptotic value) from which yarns can be considered impermeable has also been highlighted. This study underlines the importance of unit cell definition when it comes to computing permeability of 3D structures numerically generated, especially non-periodicity issues. Two methods to decrease the impact of preferential flows are then discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Numerical Study of Rotor-Stator Interaction of a Centrifugal Pump at Part Load With Special Emphasis on Unsteady Blade Load,"Three-dimensional (3D) unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) flow simulations are conducted to investigate the highly unsteady flow field at part load operation of a centrifugal pump. By the availability of unsteady flow field measurement data in the impeller wake region, a thorough validation of the simulation method is performed. Grid independence of the results is ensured. Unsteady characteristics in terms of head and shaft power as well as transient blade loads are evaluated to assess the unsteady pump performance. Significant mis-loading of the blading is revealed when one blade passes the volute tongue and associated with the strong unsteady and 3D flow field in the impeller-volute tongue region. Negative radial velocity in the tongue region is the origin of a vortex at the blade pressure side and a subsequent pressure drop that leads to even temporally negative blade loading. The results provide a detailed insight in the complex part load flow field that might be utilized for an improved pump design. As a valuable secondary outcome, a comparison of results obtained by two widely used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes for pump flow simulation is provided, i.e., the commercial code ansys cfx and the branch foam-extend of the open source software openfoam.

WoS,Evaluation of optical and gamma ray shielding features for tungsten-based bismuth borate glasses,"A series of six tungsten-based bismuth borate glasses with a xWO(3)- 20 Bi2O3- 20 Na2O2 - (60-x) B2O3), 0 <= x <= 5 wt% chemical composition were synthesized by using the solid-state conventional method. The structures of the fabricated samples were studied with X-ray diffraction analysis. Optical features such as the energy gap (E-g), Urbach energy (E-u), steepness parameter (S), refractive index (n) and Fermi level energy (E-F) were measured for the fabricated glasses with a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation code (MCNP-5) was applied to estimate the gamma ray mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) for the fabricated glasses. The simulated data showed that the insertion of WO3 increases the MACs of the fabricated samples: the highest and lowest MACs were obtained for the W6 and W1 glasses, respectively. Then, the simulated MAC was used to calculate the mean free path (MFP) for all the fabricated glasses. The thinnest MFP was achieved by W6 (increasing from 0.007 to 70,560 between 0.015 and 15 MeV, respectively), while the thickest MFP was achieved by W1 (increasing from 0.0100 to 8.975 between 0.015 and 15 MeV, respectively).

WoS,Numerical modelling and optimization of CdS/CdTe solar cell with incorporation of Cu2O HT-EBL layer,"In the recent years, use of CdTe thin-film as an absorber in solar cells has been augmented significantly due to high device efficiency, stability in the performance and cost effectiveness. In this work, CdTe solar cell has been investigated employing 2-dimensional numerical simulations using TCAD Silvaco-Atlas simulator. Initially, a reference structure of FTO/i-SnO2/CdS/CdTe solar cell was simulated based on experimental data for the validity of the simulation and the extent to which present results agree to the experimental data. To reduce the minority carrier recombination loss, a new structure is proposed by incorporation of the cuprous oxide (p-type Cu2O) layer at back-contact as a hole transport-electron blocking layer (HT-EBL). High performancehas been obtained by optimizing the cell parameters in terms of thickness, doping concentration and carrier lifetime. The efficiency of the structure is increased by 10.35% compared to the recent experimental results. Furthermore, the proposed structure consists of FTO/i-SnO2/CdS/CdTe/Cu2O presents the best conversion efficiency of 24.35%, short-circuit current density of 27.59 mA/cm(2), open-circuit voltage of 1.03 V and fill-factor of 85.83%, under the air mass 1.5 global spectrum (AM1.5G).",CdTe solar cell; Numerical simulation; Silvaco-atlas software; Cu2O HT-EBL layer,"Tinedert, IE; Saadoune, A; Bouchama, I; Saeed, MA",2020.0,Journal,OPTICAL MATERIALS,10.1016/j.optmat.2020.109970,"[Tinedert, Imad Eddine; Saadoune, Achour] Univ Mohamed Khider Biskra, Lab Met & Semicond Mat LMSM, Biskra, Algeria; [Bouchama, Idris] Univ Msila, Fac Technol, Elect Dept, Msila 28000, Algeria; [Bouchama, Idris] Univ Ferhat Abbas, Res Unit Emerging Mat RUEM, Setif 19000 1, Algeria; [Saeed, Mohammad Alam] Univ Educ, Dept Phys, Div Sci & Technol, Lahore, Pakistan",ELSEVIER,English,0925-3467,
WoS,Structural and Life-Cycle Economic Feasibility of Rooftop Low-Height Bamboo Telecom Tower Considering a Case Study from Bangladesh,"In this paper, structural adequacy and life-cycle economic feasibility of bamboo as primary construction material for a rooftop low-height telecommunication tower is examined. For this, a relatively strong locally cultivated bamboo species in Bangladesh named Bambusa tulda has been selected for the project. A joint system with transverse steel bolts, with steel plates attached to these bolts, has been proposed as a mechanism to transfer a load between different bamboo members of the tower. Bamboo samples have been tested using this joint system to ascertain the characteristic compressive (40.5 MPa), tensile (53.4 MPa), and bending strength (73.1 MPa) and also the corresponding modulus of elasticity. A 5-m high bamboo lattice tower has been modeled in the three-dimensional finite-element software SAP2000. The analysis results have showed that maximum axial and bending stresses developed in bamboo members of a 5-m high tower is much less than the allowable stresses of bamboo. The top deflection of the bamboo tower has been checked and is found to be within the acceptable limit. An analysis considering a 15-year life-cycle has showed that the bamboo tower is 18% less expensive than a galvanized iron (GI) pipe tower of an equivalent height, which it intends to replace. This proves that a low-height rooftop telecommunication tower may be economically constructed using bamboo.",Bamboo; Tower; Telecommunication; Wind load; Construction; Economic analysis,"Ahmad, SI; Alam, MS; Alam, MJ",2020.0,Journal,PRACTICE PERIODICAL ON STRUCTURAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION,10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000492,"[Ahmad, Syed Ishtiaq; Alam, Md.

WoS,Moment Redistribution in Segmental Cantilever Bridges: Simplified Approach,"Moment redistribution due to creep of concrete in cast-in-place segmental cantilever bridges can be accounted for with sophisticated software. Although this approach to design frequently is preferred, experienced engineers often do a final check based on hand calculations that have stood the test of time. This paper deals with the latter approach. Principles governing moment redistribution due to creep were revised, and results from this investigation were used to develop a novel graphical aid suitable for hand calculations in an attempt to estimate the magnitude of tensile stresses due to moment redistribution because of creep. It was found that tension stresses due to creep are not likely to exceed 2 MPa (290 psi) because the post-tensioning provided by top cables balance approximately 70%-85% of the bending moments due to concrete weight. An example for routine designs was provided.",Creep; Moment redistribution; Cantilever method; Bridge engineering; Post-tensioning; Age-adjusted modulus; Segmental bridges,"Gabaldon, LBF; Perez, JFR; Paredes, JK",2020.0,Journal,PRACTICE PERIODICAL ON STRUCTURAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION,10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000486,"[Fargier Gabaldon, Luis Bernardo] Kiewit Infrastruct Engineers, 12510 Belford Ave, Englewood, CO 80112 USA; [Rosales Perez, Jahzeeth F.; Kingland Paredes, Jorge] Diseno & Construcc Integrados Co Anonima, Ave Amer CC Cantaclaro, Merida MZB 06, Venezuela",ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,English,1084-0680,

Iran, as a vast country, needs to develop a variety of road transportation inside and outside cities. Accelerating construction procedures and controlling costs are project management requirements. Risks, in many cases, disrupt the progress of the projects and impose costs on the project. The present article began with field studies, distribution of questionnaires, and the use of SPSS17 software to detect and prioritize the risk of bridge construction projects. Then, dynamic hypotheses were issued for prioritized risks, and causal loops were drawn. Subsequently, another questionnaire was designed to explore the relationship between risks and analyze risk behavior. After obtaining results from field research, the system dynamics and VENSIM7 software were used to model and investigate the behavior and interaction of risks.

WoS,"One- and Two-Dimensional Active MASW Survey for Subsurface Profiling of Jia Bharali River Bed, Assam, India, for a Proposed 1.2-Km Road Bridge","This article describes the active multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) survey conducted at the Jia Bharali River Bed, Tezpur Assam, to identify the shear-wave velocity profile of the subsurface at the site. A new 4-lane (approximately 1.2 km) carriageway bridge construction is proposed over River Jia Bharali, a tributary of River Brahmaputra, intending to connect two national highways NH-52A and NH-37. The site consists of sand and silt deposits, intermingled with pebbles, gravels, and perched hard strata formations. The proposed bridge consists of 24 piers and 2 abutments, each separated by an interval of 48 m. Active MASW surveys were conducted at the pier and abutment locations, along with roll-along mode in-between the piers. Multiple sledgehammer shots were used at each location and dispersion image stacking is used to generate higher resolution dispersion images. Automated extraction of dispersion curve was attained with the aid of image processing techniques employing an integration of Surfseis version 5.0 and Matlab version R2019a software packages. The one-dimensional (1D) shear stiffness profile was determined at each of the test locations, which is further used to decipher the two-dimensional (2D) shear-wave velocity profile along the bridge alignment. The outcome of the analysis could clearly identify the perched hard strata that prevented the progress of borehole driving at specific locations in the site. The bearing stratum could be properly located, which would serve as the foundation depth for the well foundations. The thicknesses of the top erodible sediment deposit, the intermediate soft soil stratum, and the deep-seated bedrock were also effectively recognized. The findings of the survey can aid in effective bridge foundation planning for construction and design.",Active multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) survey; Dispersion curve; Automated extraction; Dispersion image stacking; Roll-along survey; Two-dimensional (2D) shear-wave velocity profile,"Taipodia, J; Boga, M; Dey, A; Acharyya, R; Sarma, CP",2020.0,Journal,PRACTICE PERIODICAL ON STRUCTURAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION,10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000495,"[Taipodia, Jumrik] NIT Arunachal Pradesh, Dept Civil Engn, Yupia 791112, Papum Pare, India; [Boga, Madhulatha; Dey, Arindam; Sarma, Chiranjib Prasad] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Civil Engn, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India; [Acharyya, Rana] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India",ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,English,1084-0680,
WoS,MATPLAN: A probability-based planning tool for cost-effective grid integration of renewable energy,"This paper describes the developed MATPLAN - a probability-based production costing tool that treats renewable energy sources as candidates in a power system expansion planning study. Similar to the structure of the well-known Wien Automatic System Planning (WASP) package, MATPLAN comprises six modules: LOAD-CALC, EXIST-GEN, CANDI-GEN, CONFIG, OPTIMIZE and ELCC. MATPLAN takes into account the variable nature of renewable energy sources, including both solar and wind farms, and allows a user to consider renewable energy as options for expansion planning using a probability-based model. In contrast to the current practice that treats renewable energy sources as negative loads, MATPLAN enables system planners to take renewable sources as normal options for generation expansion planning problems, which can directly determine the optimal expansion policy and ELCC analysis of a system with high renewable penetration. MATPLAN is also designed as an open access software package which academics and practitioners can adapt to their specific situations and run many case studies as a screening tool. In the case studies, the tool was validated by comparing its resulting optimal expansion planning plan against that of the well-known WASP package and further tested using realistic field data. The complete MATPLAN code repository has been released under open-source licenses for public access, URL: https://github.com/wasp2019/MATPLAN.

WoS,Effects of environmental exposure on the mechanical properties of composite tidal current turbine,"In order to meet the growing demand for energy and also to fight against global warming, Renewable Marine Energies (RME) appeared as a great opportunity for a real ecological and industrial choice. Tidal current turbines are used to extract this energy and installed on the seabed at locations where the nozzle can be prone to the accidental impact and critical loads. The principal objective of this research is to investigate the effects of environmental exposure on the mechanical properties of composite tidal current turbine, the most advanced features currently available in finite element (FE) Abaqus/Explicit have been employed to simulate the behavior of the composite nozzle under static and dynamic loading conditions. To investigate this situation, a parametric analysis is conducted which deals with the effect of velocity and geometry of the impactor. The mechanical behavior has been analyzed as both kinematic effect due to deflection of the composite structure and dynamic effect caused by the interaction between the impactor and the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic pressures over the loading. The stress and the deformation distribution are presented. On the other hand, damage modeling was formulated based on Hashin criteria for intra-laminar damage. This has been accomplished by forming a user-created routine (VUMAT) and executing it in the Abaqus software. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,"Study of operation performance for a solar photovoltaic system assisted cooling by ground heat exchangers in arid climate, China","Photovoltaic power generation application with advantages of sustainability and low emission is limited on its low photovoltaic (PV) efficiency mainly due to high panel temperature. In this paper, a solar photovoltaic system coupled by ground heat exchangers (PV-GHEs system) is proposed to reduce the operation temperature of panels and keep a high PV efficiency. Taking Tikanlik with typical arid climate of northwestern China as an example, a numerical model based on the software TRNSYS is built and its reliability are validated based on an actual thermal response test data. The simulation results show that the PV-GHEs system can reduce the panel temperature by 26.8% and increase the annual electricity yield by 7.9%, compared with conventional PV systems. Sensitivity analysis highlights the influences of environmental, geological and design parameters on the system performance. For the long-term operation, a gradually growing ground temperature is unfavorable and may weaken the heat transfer between GHEs and the surrounding ground. For the case of Tikanlik, the growing rate of the ground temperature is 0.67 degrees C per year and a minimum distance of 10 m between boreholes is recommended when more GHEs are needed. Finally, a life cycle cost analysis of the PV-GHEs system is investigated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Wind source potential assessment using Sentinel 1 satellite and a new forecasting model based on machine learning: A case study Sardinia islands,"Mediterranean islands have the advantage of favourable climatic conditions to use different marine renewable energy sources. Remote sensing can provide data to determine wind energy production potential and observational activity to identify, assess and detect suitable points in large marine areas. In this paper, a new combined model has been developed to integrate wind speed assessment, mapping and forecasting using Sentinel 1 satellite data through images processing and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and the Bat algorithm. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite images from the Sentinel 1 satellite have been used in order to detect offshore and nearshore wind potential. Particularly, Sentinel 1 images have been analysed by means of the SNAP software. Then, to extract data about wind speed and direction, a GIS software for mapping the wind climate has been used. This new methodology has been applied to the North-Central coasts of Sardinia Island and then focused on six main small islands of La Maddalena archipelago. Furthermore, ten Hot Spots (HSs) have been identified as interesting because of their high-energy potential and the possibility to be considered as sites for future implementation of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs). Finally, the ten identified HS have been used as input data to train and test the proposed forecast model. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,A study of dynamic response of a wind turbine blade based on the multi-body dynamics method,"The geometric nonlinear problem caused by large deformation and the aeroelastic issue under extreme wind conditions are becoming more and more prominent, as the flexibility of wind turbine blades enhances. To solve this problem, a model of Blade analysis with Multi-Body (BaMB) method is built by the rigid multi-body dynamics method in absolute coordinates. The model describes geometric nonlinearity and complex geometry of blades, and accurate results can be obtained by the model after blades are reasonably divided. Based on this model, the geometric nonlinearity of a 100 kW blade under static loading and the aeroelastic response under extreme operating gust (EOG) condition are investigated numerically and compared with experimental results. The results show that BaMB model is able to predict more accurate deformation than beam models under static loading when the deformation of the blade increases, especially when the blade is loaded with more than 120% of the maximum design load and the tip deflection is larger than 15.36% of the blade spans. At 210% of the maximum design load, the BaMB model can predict the deformation at the accuracy of 1.48% with respect to the test; however, the accuracies of the Euler-Bernoulli beam and the Timoshenko beam are 18.3% and 16.79%, respectively. Even in the case of large deformation, the BaMB model can reach the accuracy close to the finite element method (FEM) with high computational efficiency. The aeroelastic response of the blade under EOG condition is analyzed, and the results show that the BaMB model predicts reliable aeroelastic characteristics of the blade compared with commercial software.

The module operating temperatures under three different installation conditions of roof cement ground, water surface and grassland are calculated and simulated by ANSYS software, and the experiments are designed to analyze and verify it. Based on the difference of reflectivity and heat capacity of different ground for the PV module installation, the effects of ground type and module material on bifacial module temperature and its mechanism are analyzed quantitatively. According to the simulation and experiment results, the operating temperatures of the bifacial modules installed on the roof cement ground, water surface and grassland are 44.7 degrees C, 41.5 degrees C, 43.2 degrees C respectively, under the setting environment condition with specific irradiance, wind speed and ambient temperature. The temperature difference of 1.7 degrees C -3.2 degrees C is caused by ground reflectivity and temperature.

WoS,Quantitative risk assessment of slow-moving landslides from the viewpoint of decision-making: A case study of the Three Gorges Reservoir in China,"A large number of landslides in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China have been reactivated by reservoir impoundment since 2003. Many of them were activated as slow-moving landslides, which caused severe damages to buildings and also pose a significant risk for residents. In this study, a quantitative procedure has been proposed to analyze and assess the landslide risks to buildings and lives by considering the Outang landslide as an example. First, the landslide segmentation was done by considering the sliding history, macroscopic deformation, and monitoring data of displacement. The SLOPE/W and SEEP/W modules of the Geostudio software were used to establish the geotechnical model and analyze the seepage, respectively. Under different scenarios of annual reservoir regulation and return period of rainfall events as determined by Pearson type III (P3) distribution, failure probabilities of every segmented part were obtained with Monte Carlo simulation. Second, the vulnerability of the elements at risk was quantitatively estimated using a model that incorporated the landslide intensity and resistance of the exposed elements. Then, through the analysis and comparison of scenario-based landslide risks, the evolution of landslide risk influenced by different combinations of triggering factors (i.e., reservoir water level and rainfall) was examined. Finally, landslide risks before and after the implementation of several risk reduction alternatives were compared to determine the benefits of alternatives. The risk maps displayed that the risk was the greatest for the scenario of the rapid decline of the reservoir water level in combination with heavy rainfall; the corresponding total annual economic and population risks of the landslide were estimated in 96.88 million (sic) and 216 lives, respectively. In this scenario, the economic risk level of the west deformation zone was the highest, and the total population risk was the highest in the lower unit of the landslide. Results of benefit-cost analysis suggested that real-time monitoring and resident relocation seem to be the most effective alternatives for risk reduction concerning the Outang landslide.",Slow-moving landslide; Scenario-based landslide risk; Monte Carlo simulation; Return period; Vulnerability; Benefit-cost analysis,"Guo, ZZ; Chen, LX; Yin, KL; Shrestha, DP; Zhang, L",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING GEOLOGY,10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.105667,"[Guo, Zizheng; Yin, Kunlong] China Univ Geosci, Fac Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lixia] China Univ Geosci, Inst Geophys & Geomat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Shrestha, Dhruba Pikha] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, Dept Earth Syst Anal, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Zhang, Liang] Chongqing Geol Exploring Bur, Chongqing 401121, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER,English,0013-7952,
WoS,Dynamic Impact Experiment and Numerical Simulation of Frozen Soil with Prefabricated Holes,"To explore the effects of holes and other defects on the dynamic mechanical properties of frozen soil under impact loading, frozen soil samples with three types of circular hole defects and different apertures were developed, and a dynamic compression experiment was performed with a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) device. The results indicated that the existence of holes weakens the dynamic compressive properties of frozen soil. The effects of temperature and holes on the defective samples were evident. The trend observed in the stress-strain curve was consistent with that observed in the samples without holes. The SHPB experiment using frozen soil samples with prefabricated holes was numerically simulated using LS-DYNA software and the Holmquist-Johnson-Cook material model; the simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental results. Using the postprocessing software LS-Prepost, the specific failure mode of the samples with holes was identified. The samples were found to have an X-type shear failure that was consistent with the theoretical research and the same as the failure rule of rock with holes. The dissipation energy per-unit volume was used to represent the energy-dissipation efficiency of the sample in the experiment. As the failure of a sample with holes led to more cracks, the energy-dissipation rate of a sample with holes was higher than that of a sample without holes, and it increased as the aperture increased.",Frozen soil; Prefabricated holes; Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB); ANSYS; LS-DYNA; Dissipation energy,"Shangguan, ZH; Zhu, ZW; Tang, WR",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS,10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0001821,"[Shangguan, Zhihao; Tang, Weiran] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Appl Mech & Struct Safety Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Sch Mech & Engn, 111 First Sect,North Second Ring Rd, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zhiwu] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Appl Mech & Struct Safety Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Sch Mech & Engn, State Key Lab Tract Power, 111 First Sect,North Second Ring Rd, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China",ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,English,0733-9399,

WoS,"The role of graveyards in species conservation and beta diversity: a vegetation appraisal of sacred habitats from Bannu, Pakistan","Graveyards or sacred groves are often places of natural vegetation protected by spiritual believers because of their sacred beliefs and indigenous culture. A study of graveyards was conducted to determine their role in species conservation, community formation, and associated indicators and species composition using multivariate statistical approaches. It was hypothesized that variations in the age of graveyards would give rise to diverse plant communities under the impact of various edaphic and climatic factors. Quantitative ecological techniques were applied to determine various phytosociological attributes. All the data were put in MS Excel for analysis in PCORD and CANOCO softwares for cluster analysis (CA), two-way cluster analysis (TWCA), indicator species analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. CA and TWCA through Sorenson distance measurements identified five major graveyard plant communities: (1)Ficus-Bougainvillea-Chenopodium; (2)Acacia-Datura-Convolvulus; (3)Ziziphus-Vitex-Abutilon; (4)Acacia-Lantana-Salsola; and (5)Melia-Rhazya-Peganum. Species such asCapparis decidua,Herniaria hirsuta,Salvadora oliedesandPopulus euphraticawere only present inside graveyards rather than outside and advocate the role of graveyards in species conservation. The impact of different environmental and climatic variables plus the age of the graveyards were also assessed for comparison of plant communities and their respective indicator species. The results indicate that higher chlorine concentration, age of graveyards, low soil electrical conductivity, lower anthropogenic activities, higher nitrogen, calcium and magnesium concentrations in the soil, and sandy soils were the strong environmental variables playing a significant role in the formation of graveyard plant communities, their associated indicators and species distribution patterns.

WoS,Smooth and Stepped Spillway Modeling Using the SPH Method,"The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method was used to simulate the flow over smooth and stepped spillways in the nonaerated, skimming flow regime. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were carried out using the DualSPHysics software and compared with experimental data on a 2H:1V sloping spillway for smooth and stepped inverts. Continuous inflow fluid layers with constant height and uniform velocity were used to establish the flow rate on the broad crested weir. The ability of the SPH to reproduce the main flow characteristics was analyzed by comparing the numerical flow depths and velocity profiles with their experimental counterparts. Firstly, a convergence analysis was carried out for various initial particle spacing. The flow characteristics along the stepped spillway were more sensitive to the particle spacing compared to the smooth chute one. In general, the numerical flow depths compared well with the corresponding experimental data and with empirical formulas available in the literature. The velocity profiles, and the free-stream velocity in particular, were also well reproduced by the SPH method; however, larger differences were obtained near the solid boundary.",Nonaerated flow region; Skimming flow; Smooth spillway; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Stepped spillway,"Nobrega, JD; Matos, J; Schulz, HE; Canelas, RB",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING,10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001776,"[Nobrega, Juliana D.; Schulz, Harry E.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Hydraul & Sanitat, Sao Carlos Sch Engn, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Matos, Jorge] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Civil Engn Res & Innovat Sustainabil, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Schulz, Harry E.] Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Hydraul & Environm Engn, BR-60451970 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Canelas, Ricardo B.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Marine Environm & Technol Ctr, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,English,0733-9429,
WoS,Flow Characteristics of a Drop Manhole with an Internal Hanging Baffle Wall in a Storm Drainage System: Numerical and Experimental Modeling,"In urban drainage networks, manhole structures are used to dissipate energy and to decrease flow velocity, especially in steep slope areas. The purpose of this study is the numerical and experimental modeling of a new drop manhole in which an internal hanging baffle wall (IHBW) is used for increasing energy losses. Using open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software called OpenFOAM, the proposed model is simulated numerically. Four types of regimes (R1-R4) are identified using impact parameters (I1,I2, andI3) based on factors such as the jet impact point, the IHBW opening, and the pool depth. A semianalytical relationship is proposed based on the momentum equation to find the pool depth, which is in good agreement with the experimental data. By examining the coefficients of contraction and discharge, it was found that this system passes less discharge than an ordinary sluice gate due to the formation of a water curtain at the IHBW opening, but outperforms the existing rectangular drop manholes in terms of energy dissipation efficiency. It is mandatory to avoid the occurrence of Regime R4 in manhole design. ForI1<0.9andI3<0.7, lower and upper nappes may be submerged, which increases the possibility of manhole overflow and decreases energy dissipation efficiency. Numerical simulation results and laboratory observations are also in good agreement.

WoS,Simulation and Optimization of Venturi Injector by Machine Learning Algorithms,"This paper discusses the problem of low injection rates from Venturi injectors. The optimal combination of key structural parameters for Venturi injectors was investigated using a simulation software platform based on machine learning algorithms. The research considered different nozzle diameters under an inlet pressure of 0.3 MPa and outlet pressure of 0.1 MPa. For the various nozzle diameters, the optimal ranges of the contraction angle (20 degrees-30 degrees), diffusion angle (8 degrees-10 degrees), throat length (40-50 mm), and ratio of throat diameter to nozzle diameter (1.5-1.66) were found, and the parameter combinations that maximized the injection rate were determined. A regression model was used to predict the maximum injection rate with different nozzle diameters. For a nozzle diameter of 4 mm, the maximum injection rate increased by about 200% compared with the original model. In addition, a regression model for the prediction of the injection rate based on injector structural parameters was construction using data from physical injector models and verified by a three-dimensional printer.

Given the Russian realities, the accident risk weights were modified at the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline section. To assess the risks, the bow-tie method was used, as well as a standard checklist questionnaire. The largest pipeline accidents in the world in recent times were analyzed. The main accidents reasons were corrosion and anthropogenic factors. Methods for visualizing accident information with subsequent optimization of risk indicators during operation of trunk pipelines are proposed.

WoS,Inspection of Aboveground Pipeline Using Vibration Responses,"The purpose of this paper is to present a new kind of fast structural damage-detection method based on structural vibration responses that can be used for aboveground pipelines. This study proposes the use of structural health monitoring (SHM) for aboveground pipelines using the inner product vector (IPV) method. The IPV can be calculated from the vibrational responses signals (displacement or velocity or acceleration) under band pass white noise excitation. The vibrational responses signals were measured before and after damage. The case study is a type 304 stainless steel pipe with an internal defect. Because of difficulties in creating internal defects in practice, numerical simulation was used. This was achieved by the use of three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) modeling software (ABAQUS CAE version 6.10) with MATLAB R2015b (version 8.6) used to calculate the IPV method. To verify the simulation method, the results obtained from modeling in ABAQUS are compared with our previous experimental results that showed good agreement.

Molodensky's three-dimensional similarity transformation as a vector solution using a centroid. The solution has since been (mis)interpreted by some others with inconsistent reference to the methods of both Molodensky and Badekas, principally relating to the translation vector and the stochastic model. This appears to have led to incorrect claims that the Molodensky-Badekas method is superior to the Helmert similarity and Bursa-Wolf methods. This paper reviews the development and description of the original Badekas method, reconfirming its equivalence to the Bursa-Wolf method in the forward direction, and provides an alternative solution that suits the same-formula reversal common in commercial surveying software. It is also demonstrated that the Molodensky-Badekas method has no inherent superiority over the Bursa-Wolf method, has an ambiguous functional model, and nominally underestimates its parameter statistics when these are compared directly with those from the Bursa-Wolf method.",Similarity; Conformal; Geodetic; Coordinate transformation,"Abbey, DA; Featherstone, WE",2020.0,Review,JOURNAL OF SURVEYING ENGINEERING,10.1061/(ASCE)SU.1943-5428.0000319,"[Abbey, D.

WoS,Variation in genetic diversity of tree sparrow (Passer montanus) population in long-term environmental heavy metal polluted areas,"Genetic diversity is the bedrock of evolution. The Genetic Erosion hypothesis posits that environmental pollution could cause reduced genetic diversity. To explore the effects of heavy metal pollution on genetic diversity in natural populations, we selected an area with more than sixty years of heavy metal contamination (Baiyin, BY) and a relatively unpolluted one (Liujiaxia, LJX), and tree sparrow (Passer montanus) as study models. Five tree sparrow populations were sampled in BY at sites differing in heavy metal pollution level. Lower genetic diversity based on seven microsatellite loci was observed in the five tree sparrow populations from BY compared with those from LJX. Analysis of molecular variance indicated no significant genetic differentiation between BY and LJX. However, the observed heterozygosity and allelic richness were negatively correlated to the lead and cadmium concentrations in the primary feathers of tree sparrow. Our results indicated the genetic diversity might have a negative response to long-term environmental heavy metal pollution in tree sparrow, supporting the Genetic Erosion hypothesis. Therefore, the findings shed lights on the possible effects of heavy metal pollution on genetic diversity of wild bird populations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding-Should a Second Chance Be Given?,"Background Obesity is a chronic relapsing-remitting disease and a global pandemic, being associated with multiple comorbidities. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is one of the safest surgical procedures used for the treatment of obesity, and even though its popularity has been decreasing over time, it still remains an option for a certain group of patients, producing considerable weight loss and improvement in obesity-associated comorbidities. Methods The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of weight loss following LAGB on obesity-associated comorbidities, and to identify factors that could predict better response to surgery, and patient sub-groups exhibiting greatest benefit. A total of 99 severely obese patients (81.2% women, mean age 44.19 +/- 10.94 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 51.84 +/- 8.77 kg/m(2)) underwent LAGB in a single institution. Results obtained 1, 2, and 5 years postoperatively were compared with the pre-operative values using SPPS software version 20. Results A significant drop in BMI was recorded throughout the follow-up period, as well as in A1c and triglycerides, with greatest improvement seen 2 years after surgery (51.8 +/- 8.7 kg/m(2)vs 42.3 +/- 9.2 kg/m(2),p < 0.05, 55.5 +/- 19.1 mmol/mol vs 45.8 +/- 13.7 mmol/mol,p < 0.05, and 2.2 +/- 1.7 mmol/l vs 1.5 +/- 0.6 mmol/l). Better outcomes were seen in younger patients, with lower duration of diabetes before surgery, and lower pre-operative systolic blood pressure. Conclusions Younger age, lower degree of obesity, and lower severity of comorbidities at the time of surgery can be important predictors of successful weight loss, making this group of patients the ideal candidates for LAGB.",Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding; Bariatric surgery; Obesity; T2DM; Hyperlipidemia; Hypertension; Weight loss,"Leca, BM; Khan, U; Abraham, J; Halder, L; Shuttlewood, E; Shah, N; Ellis, HL; Aylwin, SJB; Barber, TM; Menon, V; Randeva, HS; Dimitriadis, GK",2020.0,Journal,OBESITY SURGERY,10.1007/s11695-020-04613-1,"[Leca, Bianca M.; Khan, Uzma; Barber, Thomas M.; Randeva, Harpal S.] Univ Hosp Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Diabet & Metab WISDEM Ctr, Dept Endocrinol, Coventry CV2 2DX, W Midlands, England; [Abraham, Jenny; Shuttlewood, Emma; Menon, Vinod] Univ Hosp Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Dept Surg, Coventry CV2 2DX, W Midlands, England; [Halder, Louise; Shah, Neha] Univ Hosp Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Dept Dietet, Coventry CV2 2DX, W Midlands, England; [Ellis, Hugh L.; Aylwin, Simon J.

WoS,System level design of wireless sensor node powered by piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting,"This paper proposes a design of wireless sensor node powered by piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting system. A complete system level coupling circuit model is established to predict the performance characteristics. The piezoelectric vibration energy harvester (PVEH) is based on a PZT bimorph cantilever, in which a big proof mass is introduced to decrease resonant frequency and a shell served as a stopper to avoid overload. Lumped parameters of the model are identified by experiments and calculations. Electromechanical analogy model of PVEH is simulated in LTspice software. The power consumption of a temperature WSN is tested and the equivalent load model is simulated. A power management circuit (PMC) with LTC3588-1 is designed for rectifying and regulating output of PVEH. Electrical energy is stored in a capacitor. Finally, a system level coupling model is established. Time domain circuit simulation can provide the detailed parameters about the WSN powered by PVEH such as full charge time and sustainable time of the system. Test curves of capacitor charging and WSN power supply in prototype testification show good consistency with the simulation results in LTspice. An application for temperature WSN powered by PVEH is testified as an example.

The presented algorithm is developed to investigate block, flexural and block-flexural types of toppling failures which have been coded in the Python high-level programming language. In order to investigate toppling instabilities for different modes, the three modelling steps, namely, geometrical, behavioural and mechanical simulations were conducted to appoint high-order calculation trending loops. These loops were based on the analytical description of modified second-order reliability method with first-order efficiency to determine the factor of safety values for discontinuous rock slopes. Each type of toppling failure was described based on main assumptions that were modified by geometric qualifications such as the analytical procedure, single block slip, and the Voronoi diagram algorithm for the stability analysis of the three different failure types. According to the stability assessment results of the studied slopes which were verified by the distinct numerical method via UDEC software, it has been clarified that the results obtained from the algorithm and the numerical analysis were in an appropriate trend. The used algorithm is superior in pinpointing the critical sliding zones, safety factor estimation and progressive failure analyses as compared to the numerical analyses.

WoS,Simulating three dimensional thermal cracking with TOUGH-FEMM,"Temperature change often generates thermal stress, which leads to crack propagation in rocks. In this paper, the TOUGH-FEMM simulator, which links the TOUGH2 thermal-hydraulic simulator and a mechanical simulator based on hybrid the finite-element meshfree method (FEMM), is developed to model three-dimensional cracking induced by thermal stress. The temperature distribution is solved using TOUGH2, which is an established software for modeling fluid flow and heat transfer in porous and fractured media. The thermal stress, mechanical deformation and cracking simulated with FEMM does not require any remeshing during cracking simulation, which greatly reduces the complexity and computational cost. Three benchmark examples are carried out to verify and validate the performance of the TOUGH-FEMM simulator, including thermal-mechanical stress under steady-state heat transfer, transient heat transfer and single crack propagation influenced by a heat source. Finally, the TOUGH-FEMM simulator is applied to model propagation of multiple cracks during cryogenic (low temperature) fracturing, in which the numerical results provide an effective prediction of fracture distribution after thermal cooling shock.",Finite-element meshfree method; TOUGH-FEMM; Cryogenic fracturing; Thermal cracking; Thermo-mechanical coupling,"Tao, SJ; Tang, XH; Rutqvist, J; Hu, MS; Liu, QS",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS,10.1016/j.compgeo.2020.103654,"[Tao, Siji; Tang, Xuhai; Liu, Quansheng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Key Lab Safety Geotech & Struct Engn Hubei Prov, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Tang, Xuhai; Liu, Quansheng] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Rutqvist, Jonny; Hu, Mengsu] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0266-352X,
WoS,Stability analysis model for a tunnel face reinforced with bolts and an umbrella arch in cohesive-frictional soils,"Face bolting and umbrella arch techniques are widely adopted to increase the stability of tunnels in conventional tunnelling. Nevertheless, owing to incomplete theoretical analysis models, their design mainly depends on the judgment and experience of engineers. Therefore, a safety factor analysis model and a concise design flow for a reinforced tunnel face are established based on the limit equilibrium method and the strength reduction technique, in which the failure modes of a tunnel face and an unsupported span as well as the effects of face bolts and an umbrella arch are considered. In this method, the role of the face bolts is to improve the tunnel face stability by generating supporting pressure, which is stimulated by the cable model. The role of the umbrella arch is to improve the stability of both the tunnel face and the unsupported span by the load transfer effect, which is simulated by the Winkler beam model. To validate the accuracy of this method, the calculation results are contrasted with those obtained by other typical theoretical models and numerical software, which show good agreement. The stability of the Yenikapi-Unkapani tunnel is analyzed, and the practicability of the proposed model is determined. Finally, parametric analyses are conducted to discuss the effects of face bolts and an umbrella arch on the stability of a tunnel face and an unsupported span.",Safety factor; Tunnel face; Unsupported span; Umbrella arch; Face bolts; Design flow,"Zhang, X; Wang, MN; Wang, ZL; Li, JW; Zhao, SG; Tong, JJ; Liu, DG",2020.0,Journal,COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS,10.1016/j.compgeo.2020.103635,"[Tong, Jianjun] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China; Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Key Lab Traff Tunnel Engn, Minist Educ, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0266-352X,
WoS,"A transient optimization and techno-economic assessment of a building integrated combined cooling, heating and power system in Tehran","Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems applied for residential buildings are becoming more and more common for their high efficiency and low cost, as well as high flexibility and compatibility with the grid. In this research study, a CCHP system equipped with photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) panels and micro-gas turbine (MGT) along with an absorption chiller, is proposed to supply not only the power demand of a building but also the cooling and heating demands. Different controllers are employed in the different parts of the CCHP system to handle the energy by monitoring the outside temperature in a smart manner. Dynamic simulation of the CCHP system is conducted from thermodynamic and economic standpoints, using TRNSYS software. Moreover, considering the annual exergy efficiency and unit product cost as objective functions, the optimization is carried out in the TRNOPT tool. Research outputs revealed that integrating an MGT and PVT with different auxiliary components, is able to provide both heating and cooling demands of the building. Also, the proposed system can produce an excess power of 715.32 kW.h, which can compensate for some house expenses by selling the power to the grid. The integrated hybrid MGT-PVT system yields an overall exergy efficiency of 48.01% and a total unit product cost of 8.39 (sic)/(MW.h) in optimum point. This great economic outcome is mainly due to the low natural gas price in Iran, which is nearly 0.95 (sic)/GJ. Additionally, the MGT-PVT microgeneration system can create both heat and power in the most environment-friendly manner suchlike it generates only annual pollution of 0.16 ton/(MW.h).",Transient simulation; Optimization; Integrated Building Energy system; Parametric analysis; Cost; exergy optimization,"Gholamian, E; Hanafizadeh, P; Ahmadi, P; Mazzarella, L",2020.0,Journal,ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112962,"[Gholamian, Ehsan; Hanafizadeh, Pedram; Ahmadi, Pouria] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Mech Engn, POB 11155-4563, Tehran, Iran; [Gholamian, Ehsan; Mazzarella, Livio] Polytech Univ Milan, Dept Energy, Milan, Italy",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0196-8904,
WoS,Parametric study of Stub-Beam Bolted Extended End-Plate connection to box-columns,"This paper aims to investigate different combinations of Bolted Extended End-Plate (BEEP) beam-to-column connections where the column sections are of the built-up box type. Therefore, some allowable combinations of beam-to-column subassemblages were chosen according to the AISC provisions, such as Strong Column-Weak Beam. Since the prequalified BEEP connections are generally attached to wide-flange column sections, there will be some complexities in the erection and bolts fastening processes involved where built-up box columns are used. One of these complexities is the dosed inner space of such columns. Thus, a novel connection configuration is proposed to overcome these complexities. Hence, a number of 28 different connection subassemblages were modeled in ABAQUS finite element analysis software and tested under the connection qualification cydic loading conditions. Hence, after verifying the numerical modeling's acceptable accuracy with two experimental models, the main proposed models were investigated, and their responses were evaluated. The results of this study indicate that this new proposed connection can satisfy the connection qualification criteria. However, further experimental studies are needed to be conducted to approve the practical use of this proposed connection. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,A thread synchronization model for the PREEMPT_RT Linux kernel,"This article proposes an automata-based model for describing and validating sequences of kernel events in Linux PREEMPT_RT and how they influence the timeline of threads' execution, comprising preemption control, interrupt handling and control, scheduling and locking. This article also presents an extension of the Linux tracing framework that enables the tracing of kernel events to verify the consistency of the kernel execution compared to the event sequences that are legal according to the formal model. This enables cross-checking of a kernel behavior against the formalized one, and in case of inconsistency, it pinpoints possible areas of improvement of the kernel, useful for regression testing. Indeed, we describe in details three problems in the kernel revealed by using the proposed technique, along with a short summary on how we reported and proposed fixes to the Linux kernel community. As an example of the usage of the model, the analysis of the events involved in the activation of the highest priority thread is presented, describing the delays occurred in this operation in the same granularity used by kernel developers.

WoS,Build real-time communication for hybrid dual-OS system,"In automotive/avionic/robot systems, consolidating multiple domains on a powerful SoC is an important trend. From the perspectives of safety and security, each of these domains must execute independently with a self-governed Operating System (OS). Such systems are termed as hybrid multi-OS systems. Generally, in a commonly used hybrid dual-OS system, a real-time OS (RTOS) and a general-purpose OS (GPOS) are integrated to satisfy different requirements. Inter-OS communication is the key to such systems. Specifically, services are often requested by tasks in RTOS from GPOS, but it is challenging to satisfy the requirements on time efficiency and predictability in RTOS, due to the uncertainty in communication maintenance and the time-sharing policy of the GPOS. Current existing approaches can not provide predictable time guarantees to the circumstances. This paper aims to build a time predictable and secure RPC mechanism (i.e., the primary and critical communication unit in a hybrid multi-OS system). On the foundation of a detailed analysis of the time delays in each phase of a RPC from RTOS to GPOS, we point out the drawbacks in conventional RPC mechanisms and propose an effective model and some methods to guarantee the predictability in all the phases of RPC. Furthermore, a real-time RPC scheme (termed RTRG-RPC) is proposed and applied to our ready-built TrustZone-based consolidation system (i.e., TZDKS). RTRG-RPC achieves accurate time control through three mechanisms: SGI (Software Generate Interrupt) message transforming, interrupt handler RPC servicing, and priority-swapping. Evaluations show that RTRG-RPC can achieve real-time predictability and managed priority inversion. Moreover, the design of RTRG-RPC also provides lightweight and essential protection on the security, without violation of the efficiency.",,"Dong, P; Jiang, Z; Burns, A; Ding, Y; Ma, J",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE,10.1016/j.sysarc.2020.101774,"[Dong, Pan; Jiang, Zhe; Burns, Alan] Univ York, Comp Sci Dept, York YO10 5GH, N Yorkshire, England; [Dong, Pan; Ding, Yan; Ma, Jun] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER,English,1383-7621,

Afterward, the films were irradiated with 300 keV silver ions (Ag+1) through Pelletron Accelerator by changing irradiation dose from 1 x 10(11) to 1 x 10(14) ions/cm(2) in four equal steps. The penetration depth of Ag+1 inside the film was found to be about 70 nm by SRIM (stopping and range of ions in matter) software. Structural parameters of unirradiated and irradiated films were examined by X-ray diffraction. The comparison showed significant degradation of ZnO (002) peak intensity and increase in its widening after irradiation. The Ag+1 irradiation of ZnO at 1 x 10(11 )ions/cm(2) decreased its lattice constant (c). However, the lattice constant was increased with a further increase of the irradiation dose. The absorption edge of ZnO was shifted to higher wavelengths with the increase of Ag+1 dose, as shown by the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra. The Four Probe measurement revealed a consistent decrease in the electrical resistivity of ZnO after Ag+1 irradiation up to 1 x 10(13) ionscm(-2).

WoS,Reducing Doppler noise with multi-station tracking: The Cassini test case,"Doppler tracking of Solar System probes is used for spacecraft navigation, planetary geodesy, and tests of the theory of General Relativity. The spacecraft radial velocity is measured by observing the Doppler shift of a radio signal transmitted from an Earth station to the spacecraft and then re-transmitted back, while preserving phase coherence, to the same station (two-way link) or to a different station (three-way link). Specialized orbit determination software is then used to reconstruct the spacecraft trajectory and estimate planetary gravity field coefficients or relativistic parameters. The measurement noise is a crucial element for the accuracy of the final estimates, thus considerable effort has been devoted to improve the range rate accuracy by adopting higher frequency links to reduce the dispersive noise from interplanetary and ionospheric plasmas, and by calibrating the tropospheric path delays with microwave radiometers. While Ka-band radio links (32-34 GHz) allowed a successful suppression of plasma noise, reducing tropospheric noise and ground antenna mechanical noise has been more challenging. The Time-Delay Mechanical noise Cancellation (TDMC) technique is a promising method to reduce mechanical and tropospheric noises and to improve further the accuracy of Doppler measurements. The TDMC is a linear combination of simultaneous Doppler data from a main antenna providing the two-way link and a three-way antenna (generally smaller and stiffer). If the listen-only, three-way antenna is also located in a particularly dry site, the TDMC can considerably reduce both tropospheric and antenna mechanical noises, which are the leading disturbances in two-way Ka-band radio links. For an operational WA of this method, we applied the TDMC to Doppler data at X-band (7.2-8.4 GHz) from the Cassini spacecraft acquired during the Saturn tour phase of the mission. Although X-band links are generally dominated by the highly-variable interplanetary plasma noise and are not suitable for the TDMC, we found that, when local noises are particularly large at the two-way antenna, this technique may still lead to up to a factor-of-three noise reduction (at 60-s integration time) with respect to the two-way link. The TDMC can maximize the data quality during unique events, mainly planetary or satellite flybys (such as those considered in the Europa Clipper and JUICE missions), where the scientific results could be severely hampered by adverse conditions at the tracking station.",Radio science; Cassini; Noise budget; Orbit determination,"Notaro, V; Iess, L; Armstrong, JW; Asmar, SW",2020.0,Journal,ACTA ASTRONAUTICA,10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.04.009,"[Notaro, Virginia; Iess, Luciano] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Via Eudossiana 18, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Armstrong, John W.; Asmar, Sami W.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0094-5765,

This protein binds a canthaxanthin carotenoid ligand and undergoes structural reorganization at the dimeric level, which facilitates cargo uptake and delivery. The structure displays heterogeneity revealing the dynamic nature of its C-terminal tail (CTT). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on the CTDH structures identified specific residues that govern the dimeric transition mechanism.

Here, six sampling schemes and the sampling distribution of F. schultzei on tomato were investigated. We also developed and evaluated eight sampling plans for F. schultzei on tomato using nominal thresholds, numerous field data sets and computer simulation. Beating the tomato plant apical section over a white plastic tray was the best sampling method to assess F. schultzei density. In addition, F. schultzei had an aggregated sampling distribution in tomato fields. Both sequential and conventional plans resulted in similar decision-making outcomes; however, depending on the nominal threshold adopted, the economy of time when using the sequential sampling plans in relation to conventional sampling plans ranged from 30% to 80%. The beating tray sampling method used in this study provided the best accuracy and was most cost-effective for F. schultzei sampling.

Gelatin are initially divided into finite elements and then the elements are converted into MPM particles using the characteristic length ratio and the main direction maximum stretch ratio of element as conversion criteria in order to avoid elements distortion during the solution process. The effect of the background grid size on the calculation results is studied, and the background grid should be slightly smaller than finite element so that it can better describe the severely compressed gelatin. Numerical results are presented to validate the accuracy of AFEMP program of this work, and it can better simulate the temporary cavity than the commercial software LS-DYNA.

WoS,Genetic diversity and population structure of Zymoseptoria tritici in Ethiopia as revealed by microsatellite markers,"Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by Zymoseptoria tritici (formerly: Mycosphaerella graminicola or Septoria tritici), is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat globally. Understanding genetic diversity of the pathogen has supreme importance in developing best management strategies. However, there is dearth of information on the genetic structure of Z. tritici populations in Ethiopia. Therefore, the present study was targeted to uncover the genetic diversity and population structure of Z. tritici populations from the major wheat-growing areas of Ethiopia. Totally, 182 Z. tritici isolates representing eight populations were analyzed with 14 microsatellite markers. All the microsatellite loci were polymorphic and highly informative, and hence useful genetic tools to depict the genetic diversity and population structure of the pathogen. A wide range of diversity indices including number of observed alleles, effective number of alleles, Shannon's diversity index, number of private alleles, Nei's gene diversity and percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) were computed to determine genetic variation within populations. A high within-populations genetic diversity was confirmed with gene diversity index and PPL values ranging from 0.34 - 0.58 and 79-100% with overall mean of 0.45 and 94%, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed a moderate genetic differentiation where 92% of the total genetic variation resides within populations, leaving only 8% among populations. Cluster (UPGMA), PCoA and STRUCTURE analyses did not group the populations into sharply genetically distinct clusters according to their geographical origins, likely due to high gene flow (Nm = 5.66) and reproductive biology of the pathogen. All individual samples shared alleles from two subgroups (K = 2) evidencing high potential of genetic admixture. In conclusion, the microsatellite markers used in the present study were highly informative and thus, helped to dissect the genetic structures of Z. tritici populations in Ethiopia. Among the studied populations, those of East Shewa, Arsi, South West Shewa and Bale showed a high genetic diversity, and hence these areas can be considered as hot spots for investigations planned on the pathogen and host-pathogen interactions. Therefore, the present study not only enriches missing information in Ethiopia but also provides new insights into the epidemiology and genetic structure of Z. tritici in Africa where the agro-climatic conditions and the wheat cropping systems are different from other parts of the world.

WoS,A method to decouple the geometric errors for rotary axis in a five-axis CNC machine,"When using a ball-bar to measure rotary axis error, to keep the posture of the bar constant, a linkage motion of two linear axes with the rotary axis is required, which will cause the ball-bar length to contain both rotation axis error and linear axis error. In order to get the accurate rotary axis error, a decoupling strategy based on the actual position of the double balls on both ends of the ball-bar is proposed in a CFXYZA-type five-axis machine tool. Three measurement modes, axial, radial and tangential mode, are designed with a ball-bar instrument. Six groups of length variations of the ball-bar are measured by changing both the position and the height of the ball base mounted on the rotary table. Center offset error in measurement of the ball bar length is eliminated. The relationship between geometric error parameters of the rotary axis and ball-bar length variations is derived by the homogeneous coordinate matrix transformation from which the parameters can be identified. The displacement deviation aroused from the linkage motion of the linear axis with the rotary axis is also derived. Mathematical matching is operated between the feed rate of the rotary axis and acquisition speed of the ball-bar software. Center offset of the ball-bar length data acquired is eliminated to reduce the influence of installation. An obvious scaling mismatch between the axes diagnosed from the polar plot of ball-bar length variation shows that theC-axis has the tilt error around theX- orY-axes. Experiment results show that the proposed method can improve the identification accuracy. The decoupling method is both effective and convenient for identifying geometric error of the rotary axis in a five-axis machine tool.",error identification; rotary axis; geometric errors; decoupling,"Liang, RJ; Li, W; Wang, ZQ; He, L",2020.0,Journal,MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,10.1088/1361-6501/ab7ded,"[Liang, Ruijun; Li, Wei; Wang, Zhiqiang; He, Lei] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China",IOP PUBLISHING LTD,English,0957-0233,
WoS,CD4 binding loop responsible for the neutralization of human monoclonal neutralizing antibody Y498,"Broad and potent human monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have considerable potential in the prevention and treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). To identify the key amino acid recognition site contacted with neutralizing antibody Y498, peptides were panned from the PhD-12 peptide library and predicted using online software. Then, four key amino acid sites, G367, D368, E370, and V372 located on the CD4 binding loop on gp120 of envelope of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), were found to determine the neutralization of antibody Y498. Residue E370 is in the deep part of the CD4 binding loop, which affects Y498-mediated neutralization. This form of recognition leads to a somewhat limiting neutralization spectrum of neutralizing antibody Y498, although it has some neutralization ability. Further study of the interactions between the neutralizing antibody Y498 and its epitope on the surface of the virus may facilitate vaccine development and so prevent new AIDS cases.",HIV-1; Human monoclonal antibody; Neutralization; Phage display; Recognition site,"Cao, WY; Li, BQ; Liu, H; Cheng, X; Liu, YZ; Zhao, XQ; Qiao, YY",2020.0,Journal,VIRUS RESEARCH,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198001,"[Cao, Weiyou; Li, Boqing; Liu, Huan; Cheng, Xue; Liu, Yezi; Zhao, Xueqing; Qiao, Yuanyuan] Binzhou Med Univ, Yantai, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Yuanyuan] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Pathogen Biol, MOH Key Lab Syst Biol Pathogens, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Yuanyuan] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Ctr AIDS Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Yuanyuan] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER,English,0168-1702,
WoS,"Prevalence and outcome of Lassa fever among hospitalized patients in Ebonyi State, Nigeria, 2018-2019","Lassa fever (LF) is a viral hemorrhagic illness endemic in West Africa. Annually, about 300,000-500,000 people are being infected, with about 5000 deaths. Symptoms of LF include high grade fever, headache, malaise, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or sore throat. Terminal features may include bleeding from all orifices (mouth, nose, ear, anus and vagina), facial and neck oedema or pleural effusion. People of all ages, gender, and occupations were included in this study. A total of 440 patients' samples and Bio data were used for this study. The samples were analyzed for Lassa fever virus RNA using Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 and version 7 of Epi-Info statistical software. Analysis of these samples showed LASV prevalence of 25.7%. Chi-square analysis (p <= 0.05) showed that LASV infection does not depend on age, gender, or occupation. Our research re-emphasized the fact that LASV is a serious cause of fatality in humans. Our data showed that among 327 negative patients, 19 died. On the contrary, 113 LASV confirmed positive cases had 42 deaths. This result is highly significant. More so, Lassa fever disease outcome was compared across gender. There was no significant difference between the two genders. Death or recovery from LF infection does not depend on sex. However, recovery from LF significantly depends on age of the patient. Fatal outcome is significantly higher among adults/elderly.

In order to evaluate different SFCL models, various types of this equipment including resistive, inductive and hybrid are modelled and investigated for achieving protection coordination. The purpose of this paper is to limit the current injected by DGs connected to the radial distribution network with fuse and recloser protection in presence of DGs protection coordinate between fuses and reclosers confirmed. Since increasing the size of SFCL increases its price, using the Genetic and the PSO Algorithms to calculate the minimum size of different types of SFCL in order to maintain network protection coordination.

WoS,Effect of trace carbon on the dynamic compressive properties in the as-cast Ti13V11Cr3Al alloy,"An as-cast Ti13V11Cr3Al titanium alloy was fabricated via vacuum induction skull melting. The microstructure and mechanical properties of this alloy were characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and compression experiments, respectively. The results revealed that trace impurity carbon (0.014 wt%) led to the formation of in-situ needle-like TiC precipitates during solidification. To reveal the underlying mechanism governing this formation, the (Ti13V11Cr3Al)-C pseudo-phase equilibrium diagram was constructed using JMatPro software. The results suggested that the precipitation of TiC will occur if the carbon content is > 0.003 wt%. Under high strain rate conditions, small volume fractions of these precipitates can lead to improvements in the ductility, and retention of the strength (1350 MPa). The as-cast alloy exhibited excellent dynamic plasticity, as evidenced by a critical fracture strain of >35% at a strain rate of 4158/s. In addition, microstructural observation of adiabatic shear bands revealed that debonding of the TiC precipitates from the matrix required considerable energy dissipation. Moreover, a crack propagated along the boundary of the precipitates, thereby leading to significant improvement in the dynamic plasticity from the other respect.",Titanium alloy; Carbon; TiC; Diagram; Dynamic compressive properties; Adiabatic shear bands,"Wang, DD; Fan, QB; Gong, HC; Zhu, XJ",2020.0,Journal,INTERMETALLICS,10.1016/j.intermet.2020.106818,"[Wang, Duoduo; Fan, Qunbo; Gong, Haichao; Zhu, Xinjie] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Duoduo; Fan, Qunbo; Gong, Haichao; Zhu, Xinjie] Natl Key Lab Sci & Technol Mat Shock & Impact, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Duoduo; Fan, Qunbo] Chongqing Innovat Ctr, Beijing Inst Technol, Chongqing 401135, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0966-9795,

The authors analyze data from 6200 FDI enterprises in the 2008-2019 period. Stata 14.0 and SPSS 20.0 software are used to process data. Statistical analysis shows that Vietnam's policies on attracting and using FDI capital need to focus on attracting high-invested projects, especially in services with high-tech knowledge and copper content. At the same time, there are measures to reduce the number of small-scale FDI projects investing in low-content market service industries or low-tech manufacturing industries. The results show that the trend of small FDI projects investing in Vietnam creates risks to the development of the FDI enterprises sector as well as in the implementation of Vietnam's sustainable development strategy during the period next time.

WoS,Developing appropriate pricing models for workflow and workflow reengineering in case of federated ERP system,"The workflow in case of software as a service integrates various web services depending on the needs of the user. The same is in the case of the federated ERP (FERP) system, which its functionality is provided from independent providers as web services, which are integrated as a single system against the user enterprises. The composition of FERP web services is carried out by a mediator who is introduced and described as FERP Mall through many previous papers. A FERP Mall aims to cover the needs of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to ERP functionality as integrated web services that are provided from various providers because the conventional ERP systems are mostly expensive for SMEs because of the related needs like high-end hardware, software, and customization. For the intermediation of FERP Web Services, the FERP Mall (as mediator) will provide the appropriate FERP Workflow (Wf). The relevant questions, in this case, are: How to find the appropriate price of each FERP workflow description as a marketable product? And how the mediator will logically determine the workflow reengineering price also when the user enterprise asks him for business process reengineering. Therefore, this paper aims to derive a mathematical model based on a logical analysis of the complexity of this product (Wf definition) because no like this model has been provided in the literature. In contrast, the previous researches focused on the workflow composition methods and technologies, and few of them provided some considered complexity issues. The targeted model can be considered for determining logical prices of workflow modeling and workflow reengineering in case of web services composition as a separate product. (C) 2020 The Authors.

WoS,A secure operating system for data centers: A survey,"Data centers are now evolving source of computational hardware which have high potential to bring extraordinary computing capacity to use applications with resource sharing, fault tolerance, security, and scalability. To deliver the user with efficient computational power, with the support of data sharing, resource sharing and abstraction, an operating system-like software stack is needed for cloud computing hardware platforms. Existing distributed operating systems are not scalable to handle thousands of machines in clouds. As a result, current cloud computing environments are more complex at the user side. This paper surveys the existing data center functional platforms and discusses their worth and cost, to emphasis on development of a long-term mechanism with lasting impacts for present and future data center software infrastructure demands by considering all these factors which will help the organizations to select the best operating system for datacenter as per their particular needs and priorities.

WoS,A Simpler and Semantic Multidimensional Database Query Language to Facilitate Access to Information in Decision-making,"OLAP and multidimensional database technology have contributed significantly to speed up and build confidence in the effectiveness of methodologies based on the use of management indicators in decision-making, industry, production, and services. Although there are a wide variety of tools related to the OLAP approach, many implementations are performed in relational database systems (R-OLAP). So, all interrogation actions are performed through queries that must be reinterpreted in the SQL language. This translation has several consequences because SQL language is based on a mixture of relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, which conceptually responds to the logic of the relational data model, very different from the needs of the multidimensional databases. This paper presents a multidimensional query language that allows expressing multidimensional queries directly over ROLAP databases. The implementation of the multidimensional query language will be done through a middle ware that is responsible for mapping the queries, hiding the translation to a layer of software not noticeable to the end-user. Currently, progress has been made in the definition of a language where through a key statement, called aggregate, it is possible to execute the typical multidimensional operators which represent an important part of the most frequent operations in this type of database.",data models; multidimensional model; OLAP; decision making; query languages,"Palominos, F; Cordova, F; Duran, C; Nunez, B",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL,10.15837/ijccc.2020.4.3900,"[Palominos, F.; Nunez, B.] Univ Santiago Chile, Math & Comp Sci Dept, Avda Libertador B OHiggins 3363, Santiago, Chile; [Cordova, F.] FinisTerrae Univ, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Cordova, F.] Av Pedro de Valdivia 1509, Providencia, Region Metropol, Chile; [Duran, C.] Univ Tecnol Metropolitana, Fac Engn, Dieciocho 161, Santiago, Chile",CCC PUBL-AGORA UNIV,English,1841-9836,

WoS,A Fuzzy Logic Architecture for Rehabilitation Robotic Systems,"Robots are highly incorporated in rehabilitation in the last decade to compensate lost functions in disabled individuals. By controlling the rehabilitation robots from far, many benefits are achieved. These benefits include but not restricted to minimum hospital stays, decreasing cost, and increasing the level of care. The main goal of this work is to have an effective solution to take care of patients from far. Tackling the problem of the remote control of rehabilitation robots is undergoing and highly challenging. In this paper, a remote wrist rehabilitation system is presented. The developed system is a sophisticated robot ensuring the two wrist movements (Flexion /extension and abduction/adduction). Additionally, the proposed system provides a software interface enabling the physiotherapists to control the rehabilitation process remotely. The patient's safety during the therapy is achieved through the integration of a fuzzy controller in the system control architecture. The fuzzy controller is employed to control the robot action according to the pain felt by the patient. By using fuzzy logic approach, the system can adapt effectively according to the patients' conditions. The Queue Telemetry Transport Protocol (MQTT) is considered to overcome the latency during the human robot interaction. Based on a Kinect camera, the control technique is made gestural. The physiotherapist gestures are detected and transmitted to the software interface to be processed and be sent to the robot. The acquired measurements are recorded in a database that can be used later to monitor patient progress during the treatment protocol.

WoS,Exploitation and exploration of knowledge: An ambidextrous context for the successful adoption of telemedicine technologies,"The evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the uptake of telemedicine technologies for the management of health by users is still lacking. Hence, this research explores the relevance of an ambidexterity context to balance explorative and exploitative learning processes to support the adoption of telemedicine technology. Survey data obtained from 252 healthcare end users was analysed using the ADANCO software version 2.0.1. The results derived from this empirical study support the observation that explorative and exploitative processes mediate the relationship between an ambidexterity context and the utilisation of telemedicine technology. Prior research has revealed that it is fundamentally important for organisations to be able to exploit and explore external sources of knowledge. However, for the uptake of telemedicine technologies, there has been limited research that aids in developing an adequate framework to analyse the role played by explorative and exploitative learning processes with patients. In order to address this issue, this study is done from the point of view of either home health patients or their carers.

WoS,Proteomic profiling of hepatic stellate cells in alcohol liver fibrosis reveals proteins involved in collagen production,"Background: Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation has central functions in alcohol-induced liver fibrosis. Proteins of HSCs in alcoholic liver fibrosis (ALF) are still not completely understood. Here, we performed a proteomic study to discover proteins related to ALF using HSCs isolated from a rat model. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with ethanol for 2 or 6 weeks. Liver histology was assessed using Sirius red and Oil red O staining. HSCs were enriched by using Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and analyzed using flow cytometry. Proteins extracted from HSCs were separated using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). Differentially expressed proteins were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The characteristics of the differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using the UniProtKB database and STRING software. The mRNA levels of two differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR, of which NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 2, mitochondrial (Ndufv2) was further investigated using Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemical analysis in the ALF model and human liver tissues. The relationship between Ndufv2 and alcohol stimulation was evaluated using WB. Next, Ndufv2 was knocked-down by shRNA in the HSC-T6 cell line. Three genes (encoding collagen, metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 [TIMP-1], and alpha-smooth muscle actin [alpha-SMA]) related to HSC activation were detected. Results: An ALF model was successfully established, with a liver fibrosis score of 1-2 (S1-2), and some big fat vacuoles development. Twenty-one non-abundant proteins with more than a 2-fold difference were identified using mass spectrometry, including 7 upregulated and 14 downregulated proteins. These differential proteins are a response to antigen presentation, mitochondrial metabolism, ethanol, and collagen degradation. Among them, two upregulated proteins (Ndufv2 and ATP synthase subunit alpha, mitochondrial [ATP5a1]) were involved in mitochondrial metabolism in ALF, and showed concurrent changes in mRNA and protein levels. Ndufv2 was upregulated in HSCs, as shown by WB, in non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) in the rat model and human liver tissues, and detected using immunohistochemistry. Ndufv2 was also upregulated after alcohol stimulation. Following Ndufv2 knockdown, collagen, TIMP-1, and alpha-SMA were downregulated compared with that in the controls. Conclusions: A proteomic study was performed to discover proteins related to ALF in HSCs isolated from a rat model. Twenty-one differentially expressed proteins were identified, including proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism and antigen presentation.

WoS,Influence of creep on preload relaxation of bolted composite joints: Modeling and numerical simulation,"Preload relaxation can greatly influence the durability of bolted composite joints. This paper focuses on the effects of material creep and contact creep between rough surfaces on preload relaxation. An efficient finite element model is proposed to predict bolt preload relaxation in ABAQUS. First, a creep constitutive model of the composite based on elastic-viscoplastic theory was established and the contact stiffness of uneven interfaces of the joints, featuring multi-asperity contact at the micro perspective, were derived using fractal contact theory. Then, fractal contact theory was extended to address the time-dependent elastic-viscoplastic contact problem. The models were implemented within ABAQUS software using the UMAT and UINTER subroutines. Finally, a comparison of the numerical and experimental results showed that calculation error decreased from 1.4-2.0% to 0.1-0.5% after 35 h when effects of rough surface contact were considered, thereby significantly improving model accuracy. Furthermore, the results suggest that thicker jointing materials could effectively reduce preload relaxation. In addition, according to surface fractal parameters D and G, rougher surfaces facilitate contact creep and preload relaxation. Thus, controlling surface topography could be an effective way to improve surface contact properties in practical applications.",Creep deformation; Composite structure; Bolted joint; Preload relaxation; Rough contact surface; FEM analysis,"Xie, YH; Xiao, Y; Lv, JX; Zhang, Z; Zhou, YT; Xue, YD",2020.0,Journal,COMPOSITE STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112332,"[Xie, Yuanhong; Xiao, Yi; Lv, Jiaxin; Zhang, Zhen; Zhou, Yueting; Xue, Yuande] Tongji Univ, Sch Aerosp Engn & Appl Mech, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Lv, Jiaxin] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mech Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0263-8223,
WoS,"Sensor-based gas tracking Data acquisition, linearization, and successive source tracking and separation","The propagation of information encoded in the fluctuations of chemical species of natural gas transported within natural gas distribution grids allows for a new gas tracking method. In contrast to state of the art gas and calorific value tracking based on numerical gas-flow simulations, the presented method is solely based on signal processing techniques. Due to a wider diversification of natural gas sources, gas and therefore calorific value tracking is of great interest for gas grid operators to provide fair invoicing of gas customers. The calorific value of substitute natural gas, e.g. produced by biogas or power-to-gas plants, injected concurrently into natural gas grids, typically deviates significantly over time in comparison to the prevailing natural gas in the grid. Sampling gas features like the chemical species contained in injected gases, or the standard density, by means of calibrated sensors, e.g. by process gas chromatography or infrared sensors, provides time-dependent signals that can be taken for calorific value extrapolation from source nodes to downstream nodes. To that end, we provide a general estimation of gas feature related transmission characteristics of natural gas distribution grids based on a straightforward one-dimensional diffusion model. Additionally, we present an accurate technique to estimate transit times and source fractions on gas grid exit nodes. We show with a field experiment, that gas tracking based on gas sensor signals is feasible and that our new method improves on state of the art gas tracking software based on computational fluid dynamics, already in use for gas customer invoicing.",Gas tracking; Calorific value tracking; Biogas; Natural gas; Time-variant source separation; Dynamic time warping; Viterbi algorithm,"Alexiou, A; Schenk, J",2020.0,Journal,ENERGY SYSTEMS-OPTIMIZATION MODELING SIMULATION AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS,10.1007/s12667-019-00329-z,"[Alexiou, Athanassios; Schenk, Joachim] Munich Univ Appl Sci, Lothstr 34, D-80335 Munich, Germany",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1868-3967,
WoS,"Paleoproterozoic metamorphosed calc-alkaline dikes of the southwestern Rio de la Plata craton, Tandilia belt of Argentina, record a prograde high-pressure, medium-temperature evolution","Two metamorphosed talc-alkaline dikes, a metadacite and metarhyolite, and their country-rock from El Quebracho hill in the Tandilia belt (TB), Rio de la Plata craton, were studied in detail. Both dikes contain chemically zoned garnet porhyroblasts with the following compositions: Alm(35)GrosAnd(36.5)Pyr(0.5)Spes(28) (core), Alm(41)GrosAnd(41)Pyr(1)Spes(17) (rim) in the metadacite; Alm(37)GrosAnd(38)Pyr(0)Spes(25)(core), Alm(50.8)GrosAnd(32)Pyr(0.2)SPes(17 )(rim) in the metarhyolite. We calculated P-T pseudosections in the system Na-K-Ca-Fe-Mn-Mg-Al-Si-Ti-H-O and contoured them for chemical and modal parameters of interest with the PERPLE_X computer software to model these metamorphosed dikes. Molar fractions in garnet and mineral assemblages signalize a prograde metamorphic evolution along an apparent geothermal gradient of similar to 14 degrees Ckm(-1). Syn-kinematic growth of garnet at a NE-SW compressional D-1 event during burial to depths of similar to 43 km at around 600 degrees C trapped titanite, epidote, and quartz (S-i) at crustal depths of 35-40 km at 535-540 degrees C. Afterwards, the rocks were exhumed in a continuously lasting compressional regime with S-1 formation delineated by mafic minerals in the metadacite (Ca-amphibole + biotite) and metarhyolite (biotite). Biotite with Mg# contents of similar to 0.2 in the metadacite and Ca-rich plagioclase in both dikes point to exhumation accompanied by cooling. Local mylonitization (D2) with the development of an S-m - foliation occurred between 600-500 degrees C, prior to the late post-kinematic blastesis of muscovite (Si similar to 3.15 pfu) in the metarhyolite. LA-ICP-MS U-Th-Pb dating of zircon and its trace-element signature indicate intrusion ages of 2130 +/- 10 Ma (MSWD = 4.9) for the metarhyolite and 2205 +/- 7 Ma (MSWD = 1.4) for the country-rock (metagranodiorite).

WoS,"Unsteady CFD simulation on ash particle deposition and removal characteristics in tube banks: Focusing on particle diameter, flow velocity, and temperature","This study establishes a numerical deposition and removal model coupled with unsteady gas-solid turbulent flow to predict transport, impaction, sticking, and removal (or rebounding) characteristics of ash particles with high alkali metals based on Ansys Fluent software extended by user-defined functions. Dynamic mesh analytical strategy is employed to adjust the grid on the interface of flue gas and deposition layer to illustrate ash deposit growth characteristics. In this study, the effects of particle size, flow velocity, and inlet gas temperature on formation and distribution of ash deposits are studied. The results indicate that ash deposit distribution has significant particle size dependence. Larger particles tend to deposit on the windward side of first-row tubes, and account for the greatest share of total deposited mass. Smaller particles may deposit on the leeward side of the tube surfaces. Variation in impaction rates with time are influenced by the thermophoretic force and enlarged deposition area. With the increase in flow velocity, total deposited mass increases gradually. The influence of flow temperature on impacting rates is mainly embodied in the effect of flow temperature on thermophoretic force. However, the increase in inlet gas temperature has little effect on the sticking efficiency and ash deposit distribution. Nevertheless, the total deposited mass shows an increasing trend with inlet flue gas temperature. (C) 2020 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Ninety-nine OCSCC samples were evaluated from Hospital Santa Rita de Cassia, Hospital Universitario Cassiano Antonio de Moraes and University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust. After tissue microarray construction, the slides were submitted to an in situ hybridization detection method for HPV E6/E7 mRNA. HPV status was designated a binary classification. Multiple logistic regression examined the association of HPV with clinical features and other risk factors, using SPSS (R) software. For all hypothesis tests, a significance level of p <= 0.05 was considered. Results: HPV frequency in oral squamous cell carcinoma was 8%. There was no association between HPV and clinical variables and between the main prognostic features and known risk factors. There was no difference in the prevalence of HPV for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma by geography (Brazil vs UK).

WoS,Workspace planning in construction: non-deterministic factors,"Workspace interferences and collisions occurring on construction jobsites are products of unexpected spatiotemporal overlaps of resources. They affect the project performance and can create an unsafe environment. Current practices for workspace planning adopt a linear/mechanistic approach in modeling, which ignores uncertainties occurring during construction operations. Those methods do not account for the emergent behavior of crews, irreversibility of decisions made in the case of interferences, and bifurcation of those decisions over the project lifecycle. This paper presents the results of qualitative and quantitative analysis of the significance of such gaps. A software tool was developed to model workspaces probabilistically and detects interferences from 4D models. The impact of uncertainties on interference magnitudes was evaluated based on available models, and an industry survey was conducted accordingly. The results suggest that compounding effects of uncertainties may significantly affect the frequency and volume of overlapped workspaces in a project (volumes can increase for as much as 220%, for a 40% deviation in the inputs).

WoS,Interoperability and data exchange within BIM platform to evaluate building energy performance and indoor comfort,"Most applied strategies during the building design process require careful consideration of indoor air quality and thermal conditions. This requires a detailed analysis involving multi and interdisciplinary efforts during the design process and thus, in turn, manifold interactions among various analysis methods and their simulation tools. An undesired consequence of this activity may be major problems in terms of data clashes and data losses. These difficulties may be overcome by utilizing a three-dimensional (3D) building model that not only includes the building's functional and physical specifications but also incorporates its thermal capacity and environmental dynamics. For this, building information modeling (BIM) can be employed as a base. The interoperability of the programs thus utilized need to be identified and ensued, as this is not yet clearly defined in the literature for these complicated analysis methods. This study thus aims to improve the building design process by developing a method to determine the interoperability of the utilized programs for evaluating a building's energy performance and indoor comfort through the BIM approach. A case study is conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed method and to identify the interoperability limits during the data exchange. To this end, three main analysis models are developed and evaluated. The architecture of the building is developed with the 3D building model as specified by the building's physical conditions; the indoor comfort conditions are developed with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of natural ventilation as specified by temperature, humidity, and air velocity; and energy performance is developed with a building energy model specified by the building architecture and its systems. These are then all integrated through a BIM platform.

WoS,Research on transmission line voltage measurement method based on Gauss-Kronrod integral algorithm,"This paper introduces a numerical integration method for measuring transmission line voltage using multiple D-dot electric field sensors. To date, contact measurement is mostly used for voltage measurement of transmission lines, but there are many problems with this approach, such as potentially hazardous insulation, large size and weight of measuring equipment, high cost, etc. With the development of small field sensors, non-contact measurement has become a hot spot in the research of transmission line voltage measurement. However, the inverse problem solution in the measurement is generally faced with the difficulty of solving data equations and inaccurate calibration. For above problems, a voltage measurement method of transmission lines based on the Gauss-Kronrod integral algorithm is proposed. In this paper, with the ground as the reference potential, and the vertical route directly below the transmission wire as the integral path, the D-dot electric field sensors are used to measure the electric field value of the corresponding node coordinates on the integral path, and the transmission line voltage value is obtained by combining Gauss-Kronrod numerical integration algorithm. Then, a finite element simulation model of a 20 kV transmission line was established using Maxwell software, and the Gauss-Kronrod integration node was calculated using the simulation data and the algorithm measurement results verified by simulation. Finally, a voltage measurement system for transmission lines based on LabVIEW software is designed, and a test platform for simulating transmission lines is set up for experimental verification. The experimental results show that the transmission line voltage measurement method based on the Gauss-Kronrod integral algorithm is effective and has high measurement accuracy, with errors in the range of 0.3%.",D-dot electric field sensor; non-contact measurement; Gauss-Kronrod numerical integration algorithm; Maxwell software,"Wang, JG; Li, X; Wang, Q; Zhong, L; Zhu, XB",2020.0,Journal,MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,10.1088/1361-6501/ab6b51,"[Wang, Jingang; Li, Xiang] Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Power Transmiss Equipment & Syst Se, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qian] State Grid Chongqing Elect Power Corp Res Inst, Chongqing 400000, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Lu] State Grid Corp China, Southwest China Branch, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiaobao] Nanchang Hangkong Univ, Sch Software, Nanchang 330063, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",IOP PUBLISHING LTD,English,0957-0233,

Results: PID could significantly reduce the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride (TG) and total bile acid (TBA) in serum and improved hepatic steatosis and inflammation. In terms of metabolism, a total of 36 serum differential metabolites were identified, and PID intervention regulated 24 of them, involving the key metabolic pathways such as the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, primary bile acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acids biosynthesis, ether lipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism. On the mechanism, IPA showed that farnesol X receptor (FXR) was the major potential target for PID, and PID could improve chronic alcohol intake induced by the inhibition of mRNA expression of FXR in the liver and the activation of mRNA expression of FXR in the intestine in mice. Conclusion: The present study for the first time systematically illustrated the hepatoprotective effect of P. igniarius and preliminarily explored its potential target FXR.

WoS,Evaluation of patient radiation dose in routine radiographic examinations in Saudi Arabia,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the radiation entrance skin dose (ESD) in most radiographic X-ray examinations in Taif City, Saudi Arabia. The study was carried out in 3 different hospitals in Taif City. These hospitals are indicated in this study as I, II, and III. In total, 221 images were acquired at the aforementioned hospitals by using two different techniques of dose assessment, DosCal software and the routine thermo-luminescence (TL) method. A data collection sheet was designed to record technical factors (kVp and mAs) and patient bio-data. The average of ESD for all examinations was 1.67 mGy for both methods, while the average tube voltage was 64.6 kVp. Additionally, the highest ESDs were associated with the examination of the lumbosacral and pelvis to be 7.4 and 6.3 mGy, respectively. The two methods of dose assessment were compared and a correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.93 was found.

WoS,Preclinical radiation internal dosimetry in the development of new radiopharmaceuticals using GATE Monte Carlo simulation,"The aims of this study were to construct a mouse model based on experimental data and to evaluate two approaches for a radiation dosimetry study on the development of a new radiopharmaceutical based on MIRD Formalism with free software. The first one obtaining S-values from a reference model and with these data calculating the absorbed doses. The second consisting of a specific anatomy mouse considering characteristics such as strain, gender, age, and weight used in preclinical studies comparing the results obtained for the new radiopharmaceutical Tc-99m-Ixolaris. A voxelized mouse model (C57BL/6 lineage) based on Computed Tomography images with ten segmented organs was developed by 3D SLICER software and was used as input in GATE Monte Carlo simulations (version 7.1) to determine organ absorbed dose distribution by the proposed approaches. The first method consisted of obtaining the S-values for each source organ by performing separate simulations, and the second method obtained the absorbed dose in each target organ through a single simulation containing all source organs (real radiopharmaceutical biodistributions). Absorbed dose distribution volumetric maps were obtained for each simulation. Using the first method, the numerical data were extracted from volumetric maps to determine the S-values for each source organ and in the second method the absorbed dose was obtained directly from simulation, without S-value tables. The preclinical dosimetry evaluation showed good agreement between both methods but each one has its own advantages and disadvantages: the first has less statistical uncertainties than the second method and the S-values obtained for a standard model can be scaled to other mouse sizes; the second method requires shorter simulation computational time, considering a specific anatomy mouse, using a real biodistribution with all source organs in the simulation without construction of S-value tables.",Mouse model; Nuclear medicine; Internal dosimetry; Monte Carlo; GATE,"Silva, CCO; Berdeguez, MBT; Barboza, T; Souza, SAL; Braz, D; Silva, AX; Sa, LV",2020.0,Journal,RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY,10.1016/j.radphyschem.2020.108879,"[Silva, Catherine C.

Monolithic OEICs combine, on the same die, cutting-edge optical devices and high speed III-V electronics able to generate terahertz signal targeting beyond-5G networks. Computationally efficient compact models compatible with existing software tool and design flow are essential for timely and cost-effective OEIC achievement. The analog nature of photonic devices wholly justifies the use of methodologies alike the ones employed in electronic design automation, through implementation of accurate (and SPICE-compatible) compact models.

Its equations feature the UTC PD electronic transport and frequency response along with its photocurrent under applied optical power. It also dynamically takes into account the device junction temperature, accounting for the self-heating effect.

WoS,A finite-element toolbox for the simulation of solid-liquid phase-change systems with natural convection,"We present and distribute a new numerical system using classical finite elements with mesh adaptivity for computing two-dimensional liquid-solid phase-change systems involving natural convection. The programs are written as a toolbox for FreeFem++ (www3.freefem.org), a free finite-element software available for all existing operating systems. The code implements a single domain approach. The same set of equations is solved in both liquid and solid phases: the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Boussinesq approximation for thermal effects. This model describes naturally the evolution of the liquid flow which is dominated by convection effects. To make it valid also in the solid phase, a Carman-Kozeny-type penalty term is added to the momentum equations. The penalty term brings progressively (through an artificial mushy region) the velocity to zero into the solid. The energy equation is also modified to be valid in both phases using an enthalpy (temperature-transform) model introducing a regularized latent-heat term. Model equations are discretized using Galerkin triangular finite elements. Piecewise quadratic (P2) finite-elements are used for the velocity and piecewise linear (P1) for the pressure. For the temperature both P2 and P1 discretizations are possible. The coupled system of equations is integrated in time using a second-order Gear scheme. Non-linearities are treated implicitly and the resulting discrete equations are solved using a Newton algorithm. An efficient mesh adaptivity algorithm using metrics control is used to adapt the mesh every time step. This allows us to accurately capture multiple solid-liquid interfaces present in the domain, the boundary-layer structure at the walls and the unsteady convection cells in the liquid. We present several validations of the toolbox, by simulating benchmark cases of increasing difficulty: natural convection of air, natural convection of water, melting of a phase-change material, a melting-solidification cycle, and, finally, a water freezing case. Other similar cases could be easily simulated with this toolbox, since the code structure is extremely versatile and the syntax very close to the mathematical formulation of the model.

WoS,DP-GEN: A concurrent learning platform for the generation of reliable deep learning based potential energy models,"In recent years, promising deep learning based interatomic potential energy surface (PES) models have been proposed that can potentially allow us to perform molecular dynamics simulations for large scale systems with quantum accuracy. However, making these models truly reliable and practically useful is still a very non-trivial task. A key component in this task is the generation of datasets used in model training. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Potential GENerator (DP-GEN), an open-source software platform that implements the recently proposed on-the-fly learning procedure (Zhang et al. 2019) and is capable of generating uniformly accurate deep learning based PES models in a way that minimizes human intervention and the computational cost for data generation and model training. DP-GEN automatically and iteratively performs three steps: exploration, labeling, and training. It supports various popular packages for these three steps: LAMMPS for exploration, Quantum Espresso, VASP, CP2K, etc. for labeling, and DeePMD-kit for training. It also allows automatic job submission and result collection on different types of machines, such as high performance clusters and cloud machines, and is adaptive to different job management tools, including Slurm, PBS, and LSF. As a concrete example, we illustrate the details of the process for generating a general-purpose PES model for Cu using DP-GEN.

The fabrication process was conventional melt quenching. The glasses were coded as TNNS0.0 to TNNS2.5 corresponding to their x value. The glasses' noncrystalline properties were measured using X-ray diffraction. The glasses' UV-Vis data in a 300-1100 nm wavelength were calculated. Using absorption measurements, the optical energy band gap (E-Optical) was assessed. The index of refraction (n), polarizability (alpha(molar)), metallization criterion (M-criterion) molar refractivity (R-molar), static and optical dielectric constants (epsilon(static) and epsilon(optical)), reflection loss (R-loss), and optical transmission (T-optical) were calculated. Results revealed that the indirect optical energy band gap (E-Indirect(Optical)) changed from 2.94 to 2.80 eV, while the direct one (E-Direct(Optical)) changed from 3.06 to 3.00 eV for TNNS0.0 to TNNS2.5 glasses. Refractive index varied between 2.413 and 2.453. The static dielectric constant changed from 5.824 to 6.017.

The addition of samarium oxide (Sm2O3) increased the mu values at all of the energies investigated. The effective atomic number (Z(eff)) results demonstrated higher photon interactions, possibility due to the increasing Sm2O3 content.

WoS,CDT reference values for monitoring chronic alcohol abuse in pregnancy,"Introduction and aim: Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin (CDT) is one of the most used biomarkers for monitoring alcohol use in pregnancy. However, its effective application in this context is hampered by the demonstrated physiological progressive increase during pregnancy (even in abstinent women) of CDT values, which in the third trimester can reach values close or exceeding the cut-offs usually adopted in clinical and forensic diagnostics. The present work was aimed at the re-assessment of CDT reference values in pregnancy. Materials and methods: The CDT analysis was performed by a validated HPLC-UV Vis method on 284 serum samples of women with a physiological pregnancy and on 370 sera of non-pregnant woman from the general population (control group). All the samples were tested also for GGT for excluding alcohol abuse. The statistical analysis was performed using the MedCalc (R) Statistical Software. Results: The re-definition of the specific reference concentrations was carried out according to the Horn and Pesce Robust Method. The resulting CDT upper reference values were 1.45%, 2.01% and 2.05% in the first, second, and third trimester, respectively. Conclusions: In order to prevent the development of maternal and fetal prenatal alcohol exposure complications, the use of alcohol biomarkers, including CDT, has been proposed. However, this biomarker, in the monitoring of alcohol use in pregnancy, has so far been applied adopting the same cut-off used for general population without taking into consideration the progressive physiological increase of its value throughout the pregnancy. In the present study, a specific re-assessment of the CDT reference concentrations of each trimester is reported.",Pregnancy; Alcohol abuse; CDT; Reference values,"Bortolotti, F; Raffaelli, R; Di Simone, N; Semprebon, M; Mirandola, M; Simonetto, C; De Marchi, F; Trevisan, MT; Carli, G; Dorizzi, RM; Scambia, G; Franchi, M; Tagliaro, F",2020.0,Journal,CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA,10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.014,"[Bortolotti, Federica; Semprebon, Michela; Tagliaro, Franco] Univ Verona, Dept Diagnost & Publ Hlth, Unit Forens Med, Verona, Italy; [Raffaelli, Ricciarda; Simonetto, Chiara; De Marchi, Francesca; Franchi, Massimo] Univ Verona, Dept Surg Dent Paediat & Gynaecol, Verona, Italy; [Di Simone, Nicoletta; Scambia, Giovanni] Univ Cattolica S Cuore, Fdn Policlin Univ A Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy; [Mirandola, Mariateresa] Univ Trieste, Dept Med Surg & Hlth Sci, Trieste, Italy; [Trevisan, Maria Teresa] Hosp G Fracastoro, Lab Clin Chem & Microbiol, Verona, Italy; [Carli, Giovanna] Integrated Univ Hosp Verona, Serv Forens Med, Verona, Italy; [Dorizzi, Romolo M.] AUSL Romagna, Dept Pathol Transfus & Lab Med, Cesena, Italy; [Tagliaro, Franco] Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Inst Translat Med & Biotechnol, Moscow, Russia",ELSEVIER,English,0009-8981,
WoS,Analyzing uncertainty in critical nitrogen dilution curves,"Nitrogen critical curves are frequently used to diagnose the N status of crops and grasslands. They play an important role in plant modelling and are frequently used in fertilizer management tools. During the last 20 years, a number of studies have been conducted for comparing critical curves obtained in various conditions (e.g., different cultivars) and understanding the origin of their differences. However, uncertainty in the determination of these curves is generally poorly analyzed in these studies, which increase the risk of false conclusions, in particular on the existence of differences between species, cultivars and cropping systems. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical model for estimating parameters of critical nitrogen dilution curve from experimental data. Contrary to standard methods commonly used for fitting critical nitrogen dilution curves, the proposed approach allows one to fit these curves in only one step, i.e., directly from the original biomass and nitrogen content measurements. Specifically, this method does not require the classification of nitrogen-limited data against non-nitrogen-limited data and does not necessitate the preliminary identification of critical nitrogen concentrations. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it can be easily implemented using freely-available software. We illustrate its practical interest using experimental data collected for winter wheat in France, and for maize and rice in China. We show that this method is useful for analyzing uncertainty in the fitted critical nitrogen curves and for comparing several curves obtained for different crop species and cultivars. The proposed method is based on the specification of prior probability distributions defining plausible ranges of values for the critical curve parameters, and we show here that it is preferable to use prior distributions that are not very informative if we want to limit their influence on the final result.",Bayesian statistics; Critical concentration; Critical N curve; Nitrogen; Probabilistic expert elicitation; Uncertainty,"Makowski, D; Zhao, B; Ata-Ul-Karim, ST; Lemaire, G",2020.0,Journal,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY,10.1016/j.eja.2020.126076,"[Makowski, David] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, UMR 211, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Makowski, David] CIRED, 45bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94130 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Zhao, Ben] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Farmland Irrigat Res Inst, Key Lab Crop Water Use & Regulat, Minist Agr, 380 Hongli Rd, Xinxiang 453003, Henan, Peoples R China; [Ata-Ul-Karim, Syed Tahir] ChineseAcad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Key Lab Soil Environm & Pollut Remediat, 71 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lemaire, Gilles] Res INRAE, F-86500 Lusignan, France",ELSEVIER,English,1161-0301,
WoS,A hybrid model-free approach for the near-optimal intrusion response control of non-stationary systems,"Given the always increasing size of computer systems, manually protecting them in case of attacks is unfeasible and error-prone. For this reason, until now, several model-based Intrusion Response Systems (IRSs) have been proposed with the purpose of limiting the amount of work of the system administrators. However, since the most advanced IRSs adopt a stateful approach, they are subject to what Richard Bellman defined as the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, modern computer systems are non-stationary, that is, they are subject to frequent changes in their configuration and in their software base, which in turn could make a model-based approach ineffective due to deviations in system behavior with respect to the model. In this paper we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach based on deep reinforcement learning for the implementation of a hybrid model-free IRS. Experimental results show that the proposed IRS is able to deal with non-stationary systems, while reducing the time needed for the computation of the defense policies by orders of magnitude with respect to model-based approaches, and being still able to provide near-optimal rewards.

WoS,On Byzantine fault tolerance in multi-master Kubernetes clusters,"Docker container virtualization technology is being widely adopted in cloud computing environments because of its lightweight and efficiency. However, it requires adequate control and management via an orchestrator. As a result, cloud providers are adopting the open-access Kubernetes platform as the standard orchestrator of containerized applications. To ensure applications' availability in Kubernetes, the latter uses Raft protocol's replication mechanism. Despite its simplicity, Raft assumes that machines fail only when shutdown. This failure event is rarely the only reason for a machine's malfunction. Indeed, software errors or malicious attacks can cause machines to exhibit Byzantine (i.e. random) behavior and thereby corrupt the accuracy and availability of the replication protocol. In this paper, we propose a Kubernetes multi-Master Robust (KmMR) platform to overcome this limitation. KmMR is based on the adaptation and integration of the BFT-SMaRt fault-tolerant replication protocol into Kubernetes environment. Unlike Raft protocol, BFT-SMaRt is resistant to both Byzantine and nonByzantine faults. Experimental results show that KmMR is able to guarantee the continuity of services, even when the total number of tolerated faults is exceeded. In addition, KmMR provides on average a consensus time 1000 times shorter than that achieved by the conventional platform (with Raft), in such condition. Finally, we show that KmMR generates a small additional cost in terms of resource consumption compared to the conventional platform.

WoS,Smart vehicle forensics: Challenges and case study,"Vehicles are fast becoming another important source of digital evidence in a criminal investigation. Traditionally, when a vehicle is involved in a crime scene (e.g. drink driving) or a terrorist attack, the investigators focus on the acquisition of DNA, fingerprints and other identifying materials that are usually non digital in nature. However, modern-day cars, particularly smart or driverless cars, store a wealth of digital information, such as recent destinations, favorite locations, routes, and personal data (e.g. call logs, contact lists, SMS messages, pictures, and videos). In this paper, we describe some of the challenges associated with vehicle data forensics, which is an understudied area. Next, we present our case studies on forensic acquisition and data analysis of an entertainment system on a Volkswagen car.

WoS,Seamless computing in industrial systems using container orchestration,"Industrial systems are increasingly dominated by software. In addition, this software is distributed across several compute domains, from decentralized edge to centralized datacenters and clouds. While software lifecycle management has tremendously improved in the area of cloud computing, there is no homogeneous and seamless environment to build, deploy and operate software across these domains. This leads to a separation, inefficient processes, and increased efforts in providing software that runs across the different layers. This paper introduces the concept of seamless computing, which provides a homogeneous computing environment for multi-domain applications, supporting the mobility of work-loads between cloud and edge. The approach is based on transferring established, de-facto standard cloud computing technologies to resource-constrained compute environments in the edge. After defining high-level requirements for seamless computing, a functional reference model is proposed, and existing cloud technologies are discussed. Finally, a concept and results of an implementation of seamless computing using container orchestration are presented and discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Enhancing performance of IoT applications with load prediction and cloud elasticity,"Elasticity is one of the most important services of cloud computing, referring to the ability to add or remove resources according to the needs of the application or service. In particular to the Internet of Things (IoT) scope, the use of this facility becomes pertinent since IoT requires a middleware that should be capable to handle high volume of data at real-time. Data can arrive in the middleware in parallel as in terms of input data from Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) readers as request-reply query operations from the users side. Solutions modeled at software, hardware and/or architecture levels present limitations to handle such load. In this context, this article presents Proliot - a proactive elasticity model that combines cloud and high performance computing to address the IoT scalability problem in a novel EPCglobal-compliant architecture. The model can be seen as a service that keeps the same API but offers an elastic EPCIS component in the cloud, which is designed as a collection of virtual machines (VMs) that are automatically allocated and deallocated on-the-fly in accordance with the system load. The Proliot contribution consists in a mathematical formalism that uses Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Weighted Moving Average to predict the IoT load behavior, so anticipating scaling in and out operations and then delivering VMs as close the moment they will be required as possible. Based on the Proliot model, we developed a prototype that was evaluated with different workload patterns against two concurrents: a threshold-based reactive elasticity model and non-elastic solution. The results were encouraging in favor of Proliot, presenting significant performance gains in terms of response time and request throughput. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Vessel routing and optimization for marine debris collection with consideration of carbon cap,"Marine debris pollution is becoming an increasingly serious problem, affecting not only navigational safety but also the health of marine ecosystems. Carbon emission causes ocean acidification, which greatly harms marine lives. In order to respond to these environmental issues, this paper studies marine debris collection with consideration of carbon cap using logistics network. To the most of our knowledge, this is first work to study marine debris removal from logistics way. We proposed a three-phase marine debris collection framework: (1) identifying initial locations of the debris; (2) utilizing GNOME software to predict the drifting trajectory of the debris; and (3) formulating vessel routing as a mixed integer nonlinear programming with consideration of carbon emission. The model seeks to minimize the total costs including fuel cost, berth cost, unloading cost in the harbor, vessel rent, vessel insurance, and labor cost, with respect to the constraints of carbon cap, vessel capacities, and time windows. After the linearization process, a Branch-and-Cut (B&C) algorithm with multiple variable fixing techniques and valid inequalities is used to solve the proposed model. The debris dispersion located in Boston vicinity is used as a case study to validate the proposed model and algorithm. The results reveal that the farther away the debris location is from the shore, the higher the collection cost and the more the carbon emission would be. The daily collection cost in the closest location and in the farthest location is $140 lower and $210 higher than that in the initial location. The carbon emission in the farthest location is 21% and 32% higher than that in the initial location and in the closest location. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out for the fuel price and carbon cap to test their impact on total costs These results show that proposed model and algorithm can significantly improve the efficiency of marine debris collection process, reduce carbon emission and total costs.

WoS,Dissolved oxygen variability in the Mediterranean Sea,"The interannual variability and the mechanisms controlling the dissolved oxygen concentration in the Mediterranean Sea were investigated through generating gridded fields of dissolved oxygen, salinity and potential temperature. The Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA) software was used to produce a gridded dataset for the time period 1960-2011. High oxygen concentrations for the upper and bottom layers, separated by an oxygen minimum zone at intermediate layers, are a typical structure of the dissolved oxygen in the Eastern and the Western Mediterranean sub-basins. Although an oxygen minimum zone is observed in both sub-basins, its vertical positions are different; in the Eastern Mediterranean at between 600 and 1200 m depth and in the Western Mediterranean at between 400 and 600 m. The vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen shows significant differences between the two sub-basins and their temporal evolution reveals large interannual to decadal variability. A negative correlation was observed between dissolved oxygen and surface potential temperature due to solubility changes over the whole period. However, the positive correlation between the dissolved oxygen and potential temperature in the Eastern Mediterranean deep layers is an indication that the dynamical processes are dominant and are involved in the dissolved oxygen interannual variability. The dissolved oxygen variability presents shifts with a multi-decadal signal, rather than trends as observed in the global ocean, associated with mixing processes and decadal oscillations that influence the dense water formation or biological activity.",Dissolved oxygen; Interannual variability; Gridded data; Shifts; Mediterranean Sea; DIVA,"Mavropoulou, AM; Vervatis, V; Sofianos, S",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,10.1016/j.jmarsys.2020.103348,"[Mavropoulou, Apostolia-Maria; Vervatis, Vassilios; Sofianos, Sarantis] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Phys, Sect Environm Phys & Meteorol, Athens, Greece",ELSEVIER,English,0924-7963,
WoS,A priority based greedy path assignment mechanism in OpenFlow based datacenter networks,"During the past decades, due to the advances of the cloud computing technology with tens of thousands of processing machines, the intra data-center network traffic has increased tremendously. In data-center networks, the typical communication patterns of cloud computing technologies such as map-reduce require short latency of the request and response messages to achieve high service quality. Thus, reducing the latency has been a critical issue in data-center networking. Since latency largely depends on the utilization of the links, it is intuitive that the operators of data-center networks ay to maintain the utilization of each link under certain threshold. However, when the network is highly congested, it may not be possible to lower the utilization, which causes that most of the traffic may experience large delay. To overcome such degraded situation, in this paper, we propose a flow priority system, in which flows are divided into two priority types, and the packets of high priority flows are transmitted first. In other words, instead of having the large latency for all traffic flows, at least a large portion of the flows can experience lower latency. We apply the priority system only on the Elephant flows, which are usually software update or data backup messages. Thus all the short flows get high priority. One novel idea of the proposed priority system is that the priority is decided based on the amount of traffic of each link over the path. To be specific, if the assigned path to a flow consists of only low utilized links, the flow is given a high priority. Thus, depending on how to assign a path to a flow, the number of high priority flows varies. If there is no high priority path, the flow is given a low priority. To provide better quality to more flows, i.e., to have more high priority flows, we propose a novel greedy path assignment algorithm called Greedy Flows by exploiting the flexible path computation capability of SDN. We investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm with two baseline algorithms, Global First Fit and Best First Fit. Furthermore we compare the proposed algorithm with Simulated Annealing algorithm, which is a general optimization algorithm, to see how closely the proposed algorithm performs to the optimal. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs much better in path assignment than the two baseline algorithms. Furthermore Greedy Flows performs almost as good as Simulated Annealing.",Data center network (DCN) topology; Software defined networks (SDN); Flow priority system; Elephant flow allocation; Efficient resource utilization,"Raza, A; Lee, S",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS,10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102653,"[Raza, Ali; Lee, Sanghwan] Kookmin Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Seoul, South Korea",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,1084-8045,

Vegetation is a serious component of the urban environment to alleviate the negative impacts of Urban Heat Island. In a hot city, the suitable plantation of trees is an essential parameter that can reduce heat stress.

This research focuses on optimizing the arrangement of trees with specific spatial location, in order to create green business park's landscapes. Moreover, substituting high emission thermal terrestrial materials by low emission ones plays a key role in modifying the outdoor microclimate. In order to reach the goal, the current situation of an Egyptian business park called Silicon Waha was simulated, as a case study, using ENVI_MET software to investigate the levels of human thermal comfort. Afterwards, nine scenarios considering various tree layouts with specific pavement improvements were conducted. The results obtained were then compared with the actual design to determine the best alternatives for ameliorating the outdoor microclimate and enhancing human thermal comfort.

WoS,Robosample: A rigid-body molecular simulation program based on robot mechanics,"Background: Compared with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD), constrained MD methods allow for larger time steps, potentially reducing computational cost. For this reason, there has been continued interest in improving constrained MD algorithms to increase configuration space sampling in molecular simulations. Methods: Here, we introduce Robosample, a software package that implements high-performance constrained dynamics algorithms, originally developed for robotics, and applies them to simulations of biomolecular systems. As in the gMolmodel package developed by Spiridon and Minh in 2017, Robosample uses Constrained Dynamics Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (CDHMC) as a Gibbs sampling move - a type of Monte Carlo move where a subset of coordinates is allowed to change. In addition to the previously described Cartesian and torsional dynamics moves, Robosample implements spherical and cylindrical joints that can be distributed along the molecule by the user. Results: In alanine dipeptide simulations, the free energy surface is recovered by mixing fully flexible with torsional, cylindrical, or spherical dynamics moves. Ramachandran dynamics, where only the two key torsions are mobile, accelerate the slowest transition by an order of magnitude. We also show that simulations of a complex glycan cover significantly larger regions of the configuration space when mixed with constrained dynamics. Major conclusions: Robosample is a tool of choice for efficient conformational sampling of large biomolecules. General significance: Robosample is intended as a reliable and user-friendly simulation package for fast biomolecular sampling that does not require extensive expertise in mechanical engineering or in the statistical mechanics of reduced coordinates.",Molecular dynamics; Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; Gibbs sampling; Robotics; Multibody dynamics,"Spiridon, L; Sulea, TA; Minh, DDL; Petrescu, AJ",2020.0,Journal,BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENERAL SUBJECTS,10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.129616,"[Spiridon, Laurentiu; Sulea, Teodor Asvadur; Petrescu, Andrei-Jose] Romanian Acad, Inst Biochem, Dept Bioinformat & Struct Biochem, Splaiul Independentei 296, Bucharest 060031, Romania; [Minh, David D.

For testing password strength estimation quality, we used a large set of leaked passwords from the Czech environment (approx. 3.1 million passwords), which we divided up into 12 categories. The main results are: (1) The password strength estimation improved for all 12 of the categories. (2) The overall size of zxcvbn did not increase significantly, thanks to adjustments and optimizations of both the original English dictionaries and the newly added Czech and Slovak ones. (3) The speed of operation increased by 4 to 12% depending on the version of the dictionaries used. (4) Besides the direct results for Czech and Slovak, the method described in the article can be utilized as a methodology for adapting zxcvbn for other less-widespread European languages.

WoS,SensorRE: Provenance support for software reverse engineers,"Reverse engineering is a time-consuming process essential to software-security tasks such as malware analysis and vulnerability discovery. During the process, an engineer will follow multiple leads to determine how the software functions. The combination of time and possible explanations makes it difficult for the engineers to maintain a context of their findings within the overall task. Analytic provenance tools have demonstrated value in similarly complex fields that require open-ended exploration and hypothesis vetting. This paper introduces SensorRE, the first analytic provenance tool designed to support software reverse engineers. A semi-structured interview with experts led to the design and implementation of the system. As core components, we describe the visual interfaces and their integration within an existing software analysis tool. SensorRE automatically captures user's sensemaking actions and provides a graph and storyboard view to support further analysis. User study results demonstrate that SensorRE is easy to use and that it improved the participants' exploration process.

WoS,A maturity model for secure requirements engineering,"Security is considered to be a critical software quality attribute. Tackling security at the requirements phase helps to avoid the need to rework secure software development issues. The aim of this paper is to develop a Requirements Engineering (RE) Security Maturity Model (RESMM) to assist software development organizations to better specify the requirements for secure software development. To achieve this objective, first, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the requirement practices for secure software development. Then we modified Sommerville's requirements engineering practices. We also conducted a questionnaire survey based on the identified security requirements practices. Next, the RESMM was built based on the results of the SLR, the modified Sommerville practices and feedback from the security practitioners. Finally, two case studies were conducted to assess RESMM. RESMM has 79 practices classified into 7 RE categories. The case study results show that RESMM has a clear structure and is easy to comprehend and use. In addition, the case study participants recommended that software organizations adopt RESMM. RESMM has the ability to identify the RE security maturity levels in software organizations. RESMM can also help software development organizations deliver secure software. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,"Performance analysis and optimization of a solar-air source heat pump heating system in Tibet, China","Owing to its great potential for solar energy and uniquely low relative humidity, Tibet is an ideal region for the application of solar-air source heat pump (SASHP) heating systems. This study aimed to evaluate the performance and optimize the key design parameters of a SASHP in Tibetan climatic conditions. A SASHP parallel system was designed for providing space heating in office buildings, and was modeled and simulated in transient system simulation (TRNSYS) software. The simulation results showed that for a reference SASHP system, the solar collection efficiency, with a daily average value of 0.27 and a maximum value of 0.44, is low during the entire heating season. The solar collectors could afford a high percentage of heating (even 100%) at every initial heating period. However, the overall solar fraction for heating was only 42.79% for the entire heating season. The SASHP operated with a high efficiency for most of the heating period, with a maximum coefficient of performance (COP) of 2.68 and an average COP of 1.95. Furthermore, the hot water temperature of the water tank generally varied near 45 degrees C, indicating that the water temperature satisfied most of the heating requirements with regard to the heating time. In the performance optimization, the optimal values for the area of the solar collector, angle of the solar collector, and volume of the water tank were found to be 225 m(2), 45 degrees, and 30 m(3), respectively. The average solar fraction increased to 0.793, an improvement of 85.3% over the reference system. Furthermore, orthogonal experiment results indicated that the solar collector area and water tank volume were the priority factors for the design of a SASHP system in Tibet. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,"Reservoir diversity and its genetic mechanism in the Es4 abnormally high-porosity zone of deep sandstone in the Bonan step-fault zone, Bonan Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, China","Abnormally high-porosity zones in deep reservoirs are widely developed in the fourth member of the Eocene Shahejie Formation (Es4) in the fault-step zone of the Bonan Sag, Jiyang Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, China. However, research on reservoir diversity in these abnormally high-porosity zones has focused on the shallow parts of the reservoirs, and their genetic mechanisms remain unclear, restricting further exploration and development. In this study, comprehensive experimental analysis methods, including casting thin-section observation, scanning electron microscopy and digital core analysis were used to quantitatively characterise the pore structure of the different types of reservoirs in the Es4 abnormally high-porosity zone and analyse the genetic mechanism of these relatively high-quality reservoirs. The results indicate great reservoir diversity in the Es4 abnormally high-porosity zone. The main reservoir rocks are fine-to-coarse feldspar lithic or lithic feldspar sandstone with low porosity and low permeability and can be subdivided into three types (A-C). Four three-dimensional pore-structure models were constructed via the Avizo software to quantitatively reveal the reservoir diversity. The results suggest that 'macropores' and 'mesopores' are the most significant contributors to both the total pore volume and the amount of connected pores. Many 'macropores' and 'mesopores' are connected by many pore throats in Type A reservoirs, but these are significantly reduced in Type B reservoirs. Type C reservoirs hardly contain any (connected) 'macropores' and 'mesopores'. Comprehensive analyses of the reservoir physical properties, secondary mineral composition and pore structure demonstrate that primary sedimentary conditions, calcite cementation and dissolution are the main factors that determine reservoir diversity in the Es4 abnormally high-porosity zone. Strong dissolution and effective removal of secondary products are the main mechanisms of the formation of Type A reservoirs, whereas strong dissolution failing to remove dissolution products has led to the formation of Type B reservoirs. Primary sedimentary conditions, strong calcite cementation and lack of dissolution are the main causes of failure to form effective pore networks in Type C reservoirs.",Deep sandstone reservoir; Abnormally high-porosity zone; Bonan step-fault zone; Pore structure; Three-dimensional models; Genetic mechanism,"Li, YL; Wu, HG; Zhang, YF; Liao, ZW; Hu, WX; Fu, H; Li, ZX",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107216,"[Li, Yilin; Wu, Haiguang; Zhang, Yunfeng; Fu, Hang] Northeast Petr Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Daqing 163318, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Haiguang] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Shandong Key Lab Deposit Mineralizat & Sedimentar, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Haiguang; Hu, Wenxuan] Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liao, Zhiwei] Chongqing Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, State Key Lab Coal Mine Disaster Dynam & Control, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhongxin] SINOPEC Shengli Oilfield Co, Explorat & Dev Inst, Dongying 257015, Shandong, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER,English,0920-4105,
WoS,Numerical evaluation of a combined chemical enhanced oil recovery process with polymer and nanoparticles based on experimental observations,"Polymer flooding is the most widely implemented chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) process. However, polymer degradation, caused by chemical, thermal, and mechanical stresses, is still the most notable limitation on the implementation of the technology at the field scale. Recent studies have shown that the addition of nanoparticles in a traditional polymer flooding can improve operating conditions and hydrocarbon production. Thus, a comprehensive numerical simulation study is presented to model the performance of the co-injection of polymers with nanoparticles in oil reservoirs. An articulated process was followed to take into account most of the physical and chemical mechanisms of the technique. Initially, a conceptual model was developed by identifying relevant mass transport and surface mechanisms, and their dynamics. The following phases are accounted in the model: oleic, volatile, and aqueous. Then, local mass balance equations were written for the following components: oil, gas, water, solid nanoparticles and polymers. An extended black-oil model for the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases was used. Constitutive equations were specified for polymer adsorption, rheology, degradation, and nanoparticles retention and remobilization, as well. The numerical strategy was described for numerically solving the Jacobian matrix. The model was subsequently validated in two steps: initially, the simulation results of a polymer flooding are compared to the ones obtained using a commercial software. Then, the nanoparticles transport and retention on the solid matrix was validated with experimental core-flooding tests reported in specialized literature. A set of numerical experiments of the co-injection of polymer-nanoparticles were done, showing that the synergy between both chemical species allowed to retain the viscoelastic network, which considerably improves operational and production parameters. This investigation provides a powerful tool for Oil & Gas industry and can be used to design novel CEOR deployment strategies in sandstone reservoirs.",Polymer; Nanoparticles; Chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR); Reservoir simulation,"Loaiza, CS; Patino, JF; Mejia, JM",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107166,"[Loaiza, Cristian S.; Patino, Juan F.; Mejia, Juan M.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Minas, Dept Proc & Energia, Grp Invest Dinam Flujo & Transporte Medios Poroso, Sede Medellin, Colombia",ELSEVIER,English,0920-4105,
WoS,Generalized model for plantation production of Eucalyptus grandis and hybrids for genotype-site-management applications,"The use of process-based modelling of wood production in forest plantation has increased in recent decades amongst researchers and forest companies. Although, such models are used by several plantation researchers and managers, improved options and sensitivity to soil characteristics, genotype, and management options are desirable. A new generation of forest productivity modelling needs to extend previous capabilities and incorporate modern software engineering technologies. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) Next Generation model for simulating the growth of Eucalyptus grandis and hybrids with or of E. globulus and E. urophyylla. The model simulates stem, canopy and root development, resource capture and use (light, water, N), and C and N allocation as mediated by climate, soil, genotype physiological characteristics and management. Tree dimensions (stem diameter, height, volume) are calculated as empirical functions of above-ground biomass. Datasets used for model calibration or independent evaluation were from diverse conditions in Australia (5 sites) and Brazil (13 sites), and at several of these sites there were treatments for fertilizer, irrigation or genotype. For the calibration and evaluation datasets, model performance was very good for above-ground biomass (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE = 0.96 and 0.84 respectively). Notwithstanding this general performance, and as an example, local calibration improved performance in one of the independent test datasets, suggesting that applications of the model for specific sites or clones may benefit from parameterization to local conditions. Simulation of management for weed cover, N fertilizer and genotype are also demonstrated. As the model performed well and has high flexibility, it warrants consideration by forest plantation managers and researchers for knowledge synthesis and operational productivity predictions of Eucalyptus and other plantation genotypes.",Forestry; Yield; Productivity; Forecast; Soil; Climate; Genotype; Management; Nitrogen; Water; Weeds; APSIM Next Generation,"Smethurst, PJ; Valadares, RV; Huth, NI; Almeida, AC; Elli, EF; Neves, JCL",2020.0,Journal,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118164,"[Smethurst, Philip J.; Almeida, Auro C.] CSIRO, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia; [Valadares, Rafael V.; Neves, Julio C.

WoS,GENETIC VARIATION AND POPULATION STRUCTURE OF ROSA ROXBURGHII BY EST-BASED AND GENOMIC SSR MARKERS,"Rosa roxburghii Tratt. is a well-known commercial horticultural plant in China with medicinal and nutritional values. The wild germplasm of this rose species is distributed mainly in southwest China, but the population is decreasing due to continuous exploitation, habitat destruction, and fragmentation. Therefore, assessing its genetic variation and population structure is important for effective conservation. In this study, 494 individuals from 29 natural populations from southwest China were analyzed using 10 EST-SSRs and 10 genomic-SSRs primer pairs. One hundred and fourteen different alleles were detected, with an average of 4.1 (for EST-SSR) and 7.3 (for Genomic-SSR) alleles per locus. The overall expected and observed heterozygosity values were 0.728 and 0.852, respectively, and the Shannon's information index for each of the loci was 1.532. Our results revealed that genomic SSR markers were more polymorphic than EST-SSR markers. A moderately high level of genetic variation was maintained in the R. roxburghii population in Southwest China. AMOVA analyses showed that 93.10% of the genetic variation occurred within populations. Among the populations, the gene flow estimate of 3.373 had a high value. These R. roxburghii accessions were classified into two clusters, which did not follow the geographical distribution.

WoS,MiR-486-5p-directed MAGI1/Rap1/RASSF5 signaling pathway contributes to hydroquinone-induced inhibition of erythroid differentiation in K562 cells,"Bone marrow failure is a characteristic effect of benzene exposure. Our previous study has shown that miR-486-5p is involved in benzene induced-suppression of erythroid differentiation. However, the mechanism of miR486-5p to initiate the above process remains unclear. In this study, we used miR-Tar software to predict putative miRNA targets and pathway. We found that miR-486-5p may target Ras-associated protein-1 (Rap1) signaling pathway-associated genes. Our in vitro study further showed significant dose-dependent upregulation of MAGI1 and RASSF5 expressions in hydroquinone (HQ)-induced suppression of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Over-expression or down-regulation of miR-486-5p altered MAGI1 and RASSF5 expression and modified erythroid differentiation. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and fluorescence-based RNA electrophoresis mobility assay (FREMSA) further confirmed that miR-486-5p directly bound to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of MAGI1 and RASSF5. In addition, the expressions of RAPGEF2 and RAP1A, which are downstream genes of MAGI1, were also significantly increased when HQ inhibited erythroid differentiation. Knockdown of MAGI1 reversed HQ-induced inhibition of erythroid differentiation via downregulation of RAPGEF2, RAP1A and RASSF5. Together, these data indicate that miR-486-5p directly targets MAGI1 and RASSF5 and integrates with Rapl signaling to modify HQ-induced inhibition of erythroid differentiation in K562 cells.",Hydroquinone; Erythroid differentiation; K562 cells; MiR-486-5p; Rap1 signaling pathway,"Ma, XJ; Zhang, X; Luo, J; Liang, BX; Peng, J; Chen, CY; Guo, HY; Wang, Q; Xing, XM; Deng, QF; Huang, HH; Liao, QL; Chen, W; Hu, QS; Yu, DK; Xiao, YM",2020.0,Journal,TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO,10.1016/j.tiv.2020.104830,"[Ma, Xiaoju; Zhang, Xue; Peng, Jing; Chen, Chuanying; Guo, Hongyu; Wang, Qing; Xing, Xiumei; Deng, Qifei; Huang, Hehai; Liao, Qilong; Chen, Wen; Hu, Qiansheng; Xiao, Yongmei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Toxicol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Food Nutr & Hlth, Guangzhou 510080, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jiao; Yu, Dianke] Qingdao Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xiaoju; Zhang, Xue; Peng, Jing; Chen, Chuanying; Guo, Hongyu; Wang, Qing; Xing, Xiumei; Deng, Qifei; Huang, Hehai; Liao, Qilong; Chen, Wen; Hu, Qiansheng; Xiao, Yongmei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Occupat & Environm Hlth, 74 Zhongshan Rd 2, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liang, Boxuan] Southern Med Univ, Food Safety & Hlth Res Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Trop Dis Res, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0887-2333,
WoS,Methylation Status of MTHFR Promoter and Oligozoospermia Risk: An Epigenetic Study and in Silico Analysis,"Objective: In this study, we evaluated the effects of promoter methylation of MTHFR on oligozoospermia risk, followed by an in silico analysis. Materials and Methods: In a case-control study, semen samples were collected from infertile and healthy control men. MTHFR promoter region was amplified by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Finally, the promoter region of MTHFR was analyzed by bioinformatics software. Results: Our data revealed significant associations of CpG island promoter methylation with oligozoospermia in a case-control study. In silico analysis showed that promoter contains a strong nucleosome exclusion region, a bonafide CGIs, six PROSITE motifs without a defined TATA box and 14 transcription factor (TF) binding sites, which are directly involved in spermatogenesis Conclusion: Based on our findings, methylation of the MTHFR gene promoter region may be a risk factor for oligozoospermia.

WoS,The Effect of Composol Medium on miR-16 Expression during Platelet Storage up to Day 7 at Room Temperature,"Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that play vital roles in gene regulation. It has been shown that storage has an effect on platelet miRNAs. MiR-16 is highly expressed in platelets and it appears to target the genes involved in cell death. It has been shown that platelets could be stored in Composol for a longer period of time. The aim of the present study was to assess and compare the expression pattern of miR-16 in platelet concentrates (PCs) in plasma and Composol media. Materials and Methods: In an experimental study, ten PC bags were collected and each bag was divided into two separate bags, one with the 70% Composol and the other with only plasma. Both bags were stored for 7 days at 22 degrees C and tested on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 of storage. For each sample, we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The water-soluble tetrazolium salt-1 (WST-1) test was used to assess platelet viability in all of the samples. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS and REST software. A P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: miR-16 was significantly elevated during the storage days, with fold changes of 3.47 (plasma) and 2.77 (Composol). The Composol group had significantly decreased miR-16 expression compared with the plasma group. Results of the WST-1 test showed less decrease in optical density (OD) in the Composol group (0.93 +/- 0.4) during the storage days compared with the plasma group (0.75 +/- 0.3). Conclusion: Our finding supported results from previous studies that reported an increase in miR-16 expression during platelet storage. In addition, miR-16 down-regulation in Composol medium implied that Composol might be a good solution for long-term platelet storage because it has the potential to elevate the shelf-life of platelets stored at 22 degrees C.",Blood Platelets; MicroRNAs; miR-16; Platelet Storage,"Rajabi, A; Sharifi, Z; Yari, F; Deyhim, M; Jalili, M",2021.0,Journal,CELL JOURNAL,10.22074/cellj.2021.6790,"[Rajabi, Ali; Sharifi, Zohreh; Yari, Fatemeh; Deyhim, Mohammadreza; Jalili, Mohammadali] High Inst Res & Educ Transfus Med, Blood Transfus Res Ctr, POB 14665-1157, Tehran, Iran",ROYAN INST,English,2228-5806,
WoS,Astaxanthin Reduces Demyelination and Oligodendrocytes Death in A Rat Model of Multiple Sclerosis,"Objective: Astaxanthin (AST) is a carotenoid with anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. It has also been reported that AST exerts protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases and reduces oxidative stress-induced the central nervous system (CNS) injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the protective potential of AST in inhibiting demyelination and oligodendrocyte death in a rat model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, forty Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: control group (with normal feeding), cuprizone (CPZ group) that daily received 0.6% CPZ for 4 weeks, sham group that daily received 0.6% CPZ plus dimethyl sulfoxid (DMSO) for 4 weeks, and AST group that daily received 0.6% CPZ and after 12 hours were treated with AST (3 mg/kg), for 4 weeks. Muscle strength was evaluated by the behavioral basket test at the end of every week for 4 weeks. Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining was utilized for the identification of myelination and demyelination. Myelin density was evaluated by the ImageJ software. The expression of A2B5 (oligodendrocyte precursor protein) and myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG) were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), MOG, and platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFR-alpha) genes was examined by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. Results: The administration of AST reduced the oligodendrocyte damage and myelin sheath disruption in a rat model of MS. The basket behavioral test showed the improvement of muscle strength in the AST group compared with CPZ and sham groups. Besides, the results of real-time PCR and IHC indicated the beneficial effects of AST in declining demyelination and oligodendrocyte death in a rat model of MS.

WoS,Detecting Hardware-Assisted Virtualization With Inconspicuous Features,"Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of the deployment of virtualization techniques. Virtualization is designed to be transparent, that is, unprivileged users should not be able to detect whether a system is virtualized. Such detection can result in serious security threats such as evading virtual machine (VM)-based malware dynamic analysis and exploiting vulnerabilities for cross-VM attacks. The traditional software-based virtualization leaves numerous artifacts/fingerprints, which can be exploited without much effort to detect the virtualization. In contrast, current mainstream hardware-assisted virtualization significantly enhances the virtualization transparency, making itself more transparent and difficult to be detected. Nonetheless, we showcase three new identified low-level inconspicuous features, which can be leveraged by an unprivileged adversary to effectively and stealthily detect the hardware-assisted virtualization. All three features come from the chipset fingerprints, rather than the traces of software-based virtualization implementations (e.g., Xen or KVM). The identified features include i) Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB) stores an extra layer of address translations; ii) Last-Level Cache (LLC) caches one more layer of page-table entries; and iii) Level-1 Data (L1D) Cache is unstable. Based on the above features, we develop three corresponding virtualization detection techniques, which are then comprehensively evaluated on three native environments and three popular cloud providers: i) Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, ii) Google Compute Engine and iii) Microsoft Azure. Experimental results validate that these three adversarial detection techniques are effective (with no false positive) and stealthy (without triggering suspicious system events, e.g., VM-exit) in detecting the above commodity virtualized environments.",Virtualization-based malware analysis; microarchitectural timing; virtual machine-based rootkit; virtualization detection,"Zhang, Z; Cheng, YQ; Gao, YS; Nepal, SRY; Liu, DX; Zou, Y",2021.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY,10.1109/TIFS.2020.3004264,"[Zhang, Zhi; Gao, Yansong; Nepal, Surya; Liu, Dongxi] CSIRO, Data61, Sydney, NSW 2122, Australia; [Zhang, Zhi] Univ New South Wales, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Cheng, Yueqiang] Baidu Secur Res, Sunnyvale, CA 94089 USA; [Gao, Yansong] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China; [Zou, Yi] Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR 97124 USA",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,1556-6013,

Dispersion and diversity problems arise in the placement of undesirable facilities, workforce management, and social media, among others. Maximizing diversity deals with selecting a subset of elements from a given set in such a way that the distance among the selected elements is maximized. We target here a realistic variant with capacity constraints for which a heuristic with a performance guarantee was previously introduced. In particular, we propose a hybridization of GRASP and VND implementing within the strategic oscillation framework.

The Haar technique reduces the given equations to a system of linear algebraic equations. The derived system is then solved by Gauss elimination method. Some numerical examples are taken from literature for checking the validation and convergence of the proposed method. The maximum absolute errors are compared with the exact solution. The maximum absolute and mean square root errors for different number of collocation points are calculated. The results show that Haar method is efficient for solving these equations.

WoS,Automatic Generation and Optimization of Test case using Hybrid Cuckoo Search and Bee Colony Algorithm,"Software testing is a very important technique to design the faultless software and takes approximately 60% of resources for the software development. It is the process of executing a program or application to detect the software bugs. In software development life cycle, the testing phase takes around 60% of cost and time. Test case generation is a method to identify the test data and satisfy the software testing criteria. Test case generation is a vital concept used in software testing, that can be derived from the user requirements specification. An automatic test case technique determines automatically where the test cases or test data generates utilizing search based optimization method. In this paper, Cuckoo Search and Bee Colony Algorithm (CSBCA) method is used for optimization of test cases and generation of path convergence within minimal execution time. The performance of the proposed CSBCA was compared with the performance of existing methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Cuckoo Search (CS), Bee Colony Algorithm (BCA), and Firefly Algorithm (FA).",Cuckoo Search Algorithm; Hybrid Bee Colony Algorithm; Model-driven testing; Particle Swarm Optimization; Software testing; UML diagrams,"Lakshminarayana, P; SureshKumar, DTV",2021.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS,10.1515/jisys-2019-0051,"[Lakshminarayana, P.] BMS Coll Engn, Dept Comp Appl, Bull Temple Rd, Bangalore 560019, Karnataka, India; [SureshKumar, Dr T.

For this purpose, we develop, for the first time, a rigorous theory for the electromagnetic (EM) scattering by anisotropic spheroids, using a full-wave method which features spheroidal eigenvectors with a set of discrete wavenumbers for the expansion of the fields in the region of anisotropy. We fully validate our theory by comparisons with the commercial HFSS software, as well as with a general purpose discrete dipole approximation method. Our implementation turns out to be fast, and serves as an efficient tool for modeling the resonant properties of spheroidal photonic antennas. In this context, we show that geometrical tailoring, by employing highaspect ratio prolate and oblate spheroids, allows for optimizing the nanoantenna and achieving maximal forward-to-back scattering or maximal forward-scattering with reduced back-scattering. In addition, we demonstrate how the use of anisotropic materials enables us to set this optimum state at smaller wavelengths, even close to ultraviolet (UV), as compared to isotropic dielectrics, and we reveal the key role of the incident field's polarization in achieving optimized operation for both prolate and oblate configurations.",All-anisotropic; dispersive; nanoantenna; optimization; photonic antenna; spheroidal; subwavelength; uniaxial,"Kolezas, GD; Zouros, GP; Pagiatakis, GK; Roumeliotis, JA",2021.0,Journal,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS,10.1109/JSTQE.2020.3001650,"[Kolezas, Georgios D.; Zouros, Grigorios P.; Roumeliotis, John A.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Athens 15773, Greece; [Pagiatakis, Gerasimos K.] Sch Pedag & Technol Educ Athens, Athens 14121, Greece",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,1077-260X,

WoS,We do what we can do to save a woman health workers' perceptions of health facility readiness for management of postpartum haemorrhage,"Background: In many low-resource settings, in-service training is a common strategy to improve the performance of health workers and ultimately reduce the persistent burden of maternal mortality and morbidities. An evaluation of the Helping Mothers Survive Bleeding After Birth (HMS BAB) training as a single-component intervention in Tanzania found some positive albeit limited effect on clinical management and reduction of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). Aim: In order to better understand these findings, and particularly the contribution of contextual factors on the observed effects, we explored health workers' perceptions of their health facilities' readiness to provide PPH care. Methods: We conducted 7 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 12 in-depth interviews (IDIs) in purposively selected intervention districts in the HMS BAB trial. FGDs and IDIs were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated verbatim. Thematic analysis, using both inductive and deductive approaches, was applied with the help of MAXQDA software. Results: Health workers perceive that their facilities have a low readiness to provide PPH care, leading to stressful situations and suboptimal clinical management. They describe inconsistencies in essential supplies, fluctuating availability of blood for transfusion, and ineffective referral system. In addition, there are challenges in collaboration, communication and leadership support, which is perceived to prevent effective management of cases within the facility as well as in referral situations. Health workers strive to provide life-saving care to women with PPH despite the perceived challenges. In some health facilities, health workers perceive supportive clinical leadership as motivating in providing good care. Conclusion: The potential positive effects of single-component interventions such as HMS BAB training on clinical outcome may be constraint by poor health facility readiness, including communication, leadership and referral processes that need to be addressed.",Health facility readiness; postpartum haemorrhage; health worker perceptions; work-dynamics; quality of care; enabling environment; working environment,"Al-beity, FA; Pembe, AB; Kwezi, HA; Massawe, SN; Hanson, C; Baker, U",2020.0,Journal,GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION,10.1080/16549716.2019.1707403,"[Al-beity, Fadhlun Alwy; Hanson, Claudia; Baker, Ulrika] Karolinska Inst, Dept Global Publ Hlth, Hlth Syst & Policy, Stockholm, Sweden; [Al-beity, Fadhlun Alwy; Pembe, Andrea B.; Massawe, Siriel N.] Muhimbili Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Kwezi, Hilda A.] Muhimbili Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Dept Community Hlth Nursing, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Hanson, Claudia] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Dis Control, London, England; [Baker, Ulrika] Univ Malawi, Coll Med, Dept Family Med, Blantyre, Malawi",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,English,,
WoS,Effect of Vitamin D on the Expression Level of the IL-10 and IL-4 in Asthmatic Mice,"Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the airways in the lungs and is common in many countries. Studies have shown that vitamin D levels are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma symptoms. Given the role of vitamin D in regulating immune responses and the importance of the two major cytokines IL-4 (an inflammatory cytokine) and IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) in immunological processes, in this study, the relationship between vitamin D intake and the level of expression of these ILs in asthmatic mice was investigated. In the case-control study performed in three groups of mice, 10 experimental asthma mice, 10 asthmatic vitamin D-treated mice, and 10 healthy mice as the control group were studied. For analyses, after RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, the expression level of two IL-4 and IL-10 genes was evaluated by real-time PCR. Finally, the results were analyzed by SPSS software. The results showed that in the control group, the expression level of IL-4 and IL-10 genes was 0.01 and 0.02, respectively. Accordingly, the expression level of the IL-4 gene in asthmatic mice and asthmatic mice treated with vitamin D was 0.6 and 0.2, respectively, while the expression level of the IL-10 in these groups was 1.2 and 2.8, respectively, which showed significant changes (p-value < 0.05) in treated mice compared to the asthmatic mice without treatment. Based on results, in asthmatic mice treated with vitamin D, a significant increase in IL-10 expression was observed (1.2 to 2.8), while IL-4 expression was decreased from 0.6 to 0.2. It appears that vitamin D supplementation in asthmatic patients by affecting T-cell maturation and increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10 and suppressing IL-4 may play a role in reducing the symptoms of asthma.",Asthma; IL-4; IL-10; Vitamin D,"Rouhi, Y; Naseri, F; Tahmasebi, E; Tebyanian, H; Moghaddam, MM",2020.0,Journal,BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH IN APPLIED CHEMISTRY,10.33263/BRIAC106.70777084,"[Rouhi, Yashar; Moghaddam, Mehrdad Moosazadeh] Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Appl Biotechnol Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Naseri, Farnoosh] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Lab Senior Tech Associate Med Genet Ward, Imam Hosp Complex, Tehran, Iran; [Tahmasebi, Elahe; Tebyanian, Hamid] Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Prevent Oral & Dent Dis, Tehran, Iran",BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH APPLIED CHEMISTRY,English,2069-5837,
WoS,"Effects of colour and intensity of artificial light produced by incandescent bulbs on the performance traits, thyroid hormones, and blood metabolites of broiler chickens","Light is an important environmental factor in poultry farm management. Duration, intensity and colour of light (wavelength) can be affected the poultry performance. The aim of present research was to study the effect of colour and intensity of incandescent bulbs light on the performance traits, hormones, and blood metabolites of broiler chickens. For this, a factorial experiment was used in the form of a completely randomised design for 42 days. The factors were included the colour and intensity of light. The number of treatment and replication was 6 and 4, respectively. Ross 308 male broiler chicken was used. Performance traits, hormones, and blood metabolites were measured and analysed with the Lsmeans procedure by SAS software. The effect of studied factors was significant (p < .05) on the body weight and feed conversion ratio (FCR) at all rearing periods. The best body weight and FCR were observed in the green light with the 50 lux intensity. The light colour effect was significant (p < .05) on the haemoglobin and haematocrit levels. Reducing the blood haemoglobin concentration in red light relative to green light can be due to a decrease in metabolic activity, which leads to a decrease in erythropoiesis and subsequently decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.

WoS,Data-driven optimization model customization,"When embedded in software-based decision support systems, optimization models can greatly improve organizational planning. In many industries, there are classical models that capture the fundamentals of general planning decisions (e.g., designing a delivery route). However, these models are generic and often require customization to truly reflect the realities of specific operational settings. Yet, such customization can be an expensive and time-consuming process. At the same time, popular cloud computing software platforms such as Software as a Service (SaaS) are not amenable to customized software applications. We present a framework that has the potential to autonomously customize optimization models by learning mathematical representations of customer-specific business rules from historical data derived from model solutions and implemented plans. Because of the wide-spread use in practice of mixed integer linear programs (MILP) and the power of MILP solvers, the framework is designed for MILP models. It uses a common mathematical representation for different optimization models and business rules, which it encodes in a standard data structure. As a result, a software provider employing this framework can develop and maintain a single code-base while meeting the needs of different customers. We assess the effectiveness of this framework on multiple classical MILPs used in the planning of logistics and supply chain operations and with different business rules that must be observed by implementable plans. Computational experiments based on synthetic data indicate that solutions to the customized optimization models produced by the framework are regularly of high-quality. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Our approach can transfer energy over tens of meters and even to targets blocked by obstacles. Compared to popular beamforming based WPTs, our approach leads to a drastically different energy density distribution: the energy density at the target receiver is much higher than the energy density at other locations. Due to this unique energy distribution pattern, our approach offers a safer WPT solution, which can be potentially scaled up to ship a higher level of energy over longer distances. Specifically, we model the energy density distribution and prove that our proposed system can create a high energy peak exactly at the target receiver. Then we conduct detailed simulation studies to investigate how the actual energy distribution is impacted by various important system parameters, including number/topology of transmitters, transmitter antenna directionality, the distance between receiver and transmitters, and environmental multipath.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI) and orthodontics-related quality of life (QOL) among first course high school students in Kerman, Iran. METHODS: The present cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 400 first course high school students selected through two-stage cluster sampling method during 2017 to 2018. Data were collected using 22-item orthodontics-related QOL and DAI questionnaires, and then analyzed by SPSS software using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression tests. P-value was considered at significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: According to DAI score, 15.7% of students needed mandatory orthodontic treatment and 39.4% had no orthodontic or minor treatment. Mean orthodontics-related QOL score was 15.60 +/- 11.16 out of 88. No significant correlation was found between total score of questionnaire, items of DAI, DAI score, and different domains of questionnaire with DAI. Moreover, there was no significant difference between gender, DAI, and the mean score of orthodontics-related QOL questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, the orthodontics-related QOL was high in first course high school students. Additionally, no statistical correlation was reported between DAI and orthodontics-related QOL and corresponding domains.",Malocclusion; Quality of Life; Treatment Need; Students,"Torabi-Parizi, M; Karimi-Afshar, M; Mashayekhi, F; Karimi-Afshar, M; Aminian, A",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF ORAL HEALTH AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,10.22122/johoe.v9i1.1033,"[Torabi-Parizi, Molouk] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Social Determinants Oral Hlth Res Ctr, Kerman, Iran; [Karimi-Afshar, Marzieh] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Sch Dent, Dept Orthodont, Kerman, Iran; [Karimi-Afshar, Mehrnaz] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Dent, Dept Prosthodont, Tehran, Iran",KERMAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES,English,2322-1372,
WoS,Smart hardware integration with advanced robot programming technologies for efficient reconfiguration of robot workcells,"The manufacturing industry is seeing an increase in demand for more custom-made, low-volume production. This type of production is rarely automated and is to a large extent still performed manually. To keep up with the competition and market demands, manufacturers will have to undertake the effort to automate such manufacturing processes. However, automating low-volume production is no small feat as the solution should be adaptable and future proof to unexpected changes in customers' demands. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable robot workcell aimed at automating low-volume production. The developed workcell can adapt to the changes in manufacturing processes by employing a number of passive, reconfigurable hardware elements, supported by the ROS-based, modular control software. To further facilitate and expedite the setup process, we integrated intuitive, user-friendly robot programming methods with the available hardware. The system was evaluated by implementing five production processes from different manufacturing industries.",Reconfigurable manufacturing systems; Passive reconfigurable hardware; ROS; Programming by demonstration; Industry 4.0,"Gaspar, T; Denisa, M; Radanovic, P; Ridge, B; Savarimuthu, TR; Kramberger, A; Priggemeyer, M; Rossmann, J; Worgotter, F; Ivanovska, T; Parizi, S; Gosar, Z; Kovac, I; Ude, A",2020.0,Journal,ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING,10.1016/j.rcim.2020.101979,"[Gaspar, Timotej; Denisa, Miha; Radanovic, Primoz; Ridge, Barry; Kramberger, Aljaz; Kovac, Igor; Ude, Aled] Jozef Stefan Inst, Dept Automat Biocybernet & Robot, Humanoid & Cognit Robot Lab, Jamova Cesta 39, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Savarimuthu, T.

WoS,PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF SHIPPING CONTAINER POTENTIALS FOR NET-ZERO RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS,"Recycled shipping containers have the potential to be successfully used as a net-zero ready home. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of a high-performance shipping container single-family housing project located in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The project was awarded the Best Undergraduate Project in the Single-family division at the 2019 U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon Design Challenge. The Hampton University Millennial Village Design Team designed a marketable net-zero ready container home for the ViBe Creative District in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Container Homes are not suitable for every homeowner, but they have a particular appeal to a generation of young and creative people across the country. For many municipalities in Virginia, where container housing is not readily accepted, the ViBe creative district has been having discussions with City code officials and local architects about the benefits. The Hampton University Millennial Village Design Team aimed to take advantage of the competition as an opportunity to explore a building construction method that is not widely seen in this part of the country. Testing design for net-zero readiness is a comprehensive way to understand how this type of construction performs from a building science standpoint. Collaboration with professional industry advisors helped the team to use research-based design methods to work on a unique project that the team believes will become a reality in the future. For the performance assessment of a net-zero container house, several simulation tools were used to investigate the environmental impacts, daylight performance, envelope performance, Energy Use Intensity (EUI), Home Energy Rating System (HERS), and solar energy generation. As for energy standards and codes, the Virginia residential code (VRC) 2015, International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 2015 and The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 90.1-2013 for residential buildings were consulted to set each variable for the net-zero container house project.

WoS,Computational fluid dynamics analysis of flow through immobilized catalyzed packed bed reactor for removal of 4-chlorophenol from wastewater,"The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the packed bed reactor (PBR) was carried out using ANSYS Fluent software. The various process parameters, such as inlet concentration of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), flow rate, bed height, and porosity, were optimized to predict maximum biodegradation of 4-CP in immobilized catalyzed PBR. The geometrical mesh of the PBR was constructed using Gambit software, and a mesh size of 236995 was selected from the grid-independent study. A laminar flow model was used to understand the hydrodynamics as well as concentration profile of 4-CP inside the PBR using Fluent software. Through CFD, the effect of the flow rate, inlet concentration, and the bed height and porosity of the immobilized catalyst bed on the static pressure, mass imbalance, velocity, and stress-strain field inside the PBR was visualized. CFD simulation study predicted that maximum biodegradation of 4-CP was found in the presence of 500 mg/L of inlet concentration of 4-CP, 4 mL/min of flow rate, 18 cm of bed height and 0.375 of porosity. An experimental study was conducted for wastewater flow through the B. subtilis MF447840.1 immobilized catalyzed PBR to remove the 4-CP in the laminar flow region.

WoS,The Bookness of a Book: Cataloging Affect in South African Artists' Books,"In 2005, the internationally renowned private collector of artists' books Jack Ginsberg, his assistant Rosalind Cleaver, software developer Peter Dennis, and I began creating a database of every artist's book produced in South Africa. By linking the artists' books in the Ginsberg Collection with others that I had located during my research, we began constructing a bibliographic project: a comprehensive, freely accessible online database of the output of a nation. This national output of artists' books, however, constitutes a sliver of artistic production and is little known as a genre and confusing as a form to the majority of South Africans. It comes as no surprise that one of the most well-documented problems facing the cataloging of artists' books is grappling with their hybrid nature, as each claims territory within the contested space of the book arts. It is within this challenging space that important work can be done. With the collection having been donated to a university in 2019, I unpack some of our work that aims to not only bring these local objects to greater public attention but also ensure that the cataloging of these objects accounts for their affective nature as works of art. Taking Anne Thurmann-Jajes's Manual for Artists' Publications (2010) as a point of departure, I examine the South African artist's book database as a case study. Key texts are unpacked, shedding light on particular problems associated with describing artists' books, including acknowledging their self-conscious, reflexive, and artistic character, not merely their subject matter and material elements. While working within broad bibliographic standards, we have modified these by developing our own bespoke software that liberates us from the strictures and limitations of the standard MARC record. This helps us write a set of descriptors that catalog South African artists' books' affective elements more meaningfully and richly. This work is contextualized in three examples. The first shows the refinements that were needed within the data fields in order to create an amplified record on our online database. The second shows how these refinements help to open up a space for the recording of affective content in the bibliographic record. This is done by acknowledging the work's self-conscious and reflexive elements. The third shows how such affect-rich descriptions are able to provide a reciprocal view of the idiosyncrasies of South African life.",,"Paton, D",2020.0,Journal,LIBRARY TRENDS,,"[Paton, David] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Visual Art, Johannesburg, South Africa",JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,English,0024-2594,
WoS,Getting a Sign in Edgewise: User-Centered Design Considerations in Creating a Signed Language Mentoring Management System,"Teaching and learning resources for acquiring languages usually rely on the use of a conventional writing system or script of the target language as means to support learning. However, in the case of learning American Sign Language (ASL), there is no widely adopted ASL script, and many available software tools are designed around English (or other spoken language) script-which is not the target language the student is learning. As such, these resources must be redesigned or modified for use in supporting ASL learning. In this article, we describe the progress of a software development project called TerpTube intended to address this problem. We also report the results of a user study to validate the initial software design plans.The TerpTube project and software aim to support the language learning needs of ASL and interpretation students and their mentors. Because using English text in the software interface may hinder the learning of ASL and video format is the primary way to represent ASL, we designed the interface to be video-centric, or Deaf-centric. Using ASL video rather than English text comments to comment on videos is an example of Deaf-centric design. To evaluate our initial design cycle using usability and usefulness metrics, we recruited 20 participants from the interpreter training programs at Eastern Kentucky University in the United States and George Brown College in Canada. The study results demonstrate that participants found the software useful and easy to learn, although some issues were reported with the video commenting feature. Overall, participants reported an interest in, and the need for, using this software in ASL instruction. We continue to explore and evaluate principles of Deaf-centric software design. Such design principles include navigation features that do not rely on English text alone and options for user-generated content video. ASL immersion in software environments is likely to support students' learning of the language and demonstrates respect for the primary language of the users who mentor them.",,"Hibbard, E; Gerdzhev, M; Stevens, T; Roush, D; Fels, D",2020.0,Journal,SIGN LANGUAGE STUDIES,10.1353/sls.2020.0002,"[Hibbard, Evan] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Undergrad Studies Educ, Deaf Studies, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Gerdzhev, Martin] Huawei Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Gerdzhev, Martin] McGill Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Stevens, Tara; Roush, Daniel] Eastern Kentucky Univ, Dept Amer Sign Language & Interpreter Educ, Richmond, KY 40475 USA; [Stevens, Tara] Gallaudet Univ, Dept Interpretat & Translat, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Fels, Deborah] Ryerson Univ, Dept Informat Technol Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fels, Deborah] Inclus Media & Design Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada",GALLAUDET UNIV PRESS,English,0302-1475,
WoS,Stability Analysis of Salt Cavern Gas Storage Using 2D Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical Finite-Element Software,"Ensuring the stability and integrity of underground gas storage salt caverns is a very complicated subject due to the non-linear and time-dependent behavior of rock salts under complicated thermal and mechanical loading conditions. For this reason, pressure and temperature fluctuations in the caverns and their surrounding strata must be integrated into the analysis and the numerical tools that are used for this purpose. LOCAS, a 2D axisymmetric finite-element code, dedicated to the stability analysis of underground salt spaces, was applied to assess the effects of various operating and geometrical parameters on the cavern behavior. In this paper, we aimed to give an overall assessment of the behavior of the salt caverns used for natural gas storage. In this work, some specific loading scenarios were considered first, followed by thorough parametric and sensitivity analyses to reveal the impacts of the geometrical parameters and operational parameters involved on the behavior of salt caverns using the modern stability criteria. The findings showed that the onset of dilation was more likely to happen within the first cavern life cycle when pressure dropped to the minimum level. As for the potential of tension occurrence in the surrounding rock, this is more likely to happen by increasing the number of operation cycles, especially in the upper one-third of the cavern wall. Finally, it was seen that the cavern depth and minimum cavern internal pressure had even more important influences than the others on the salt cavern behavior.",Salt cavern; Stability analysis; Finite element modeling; Sensitivity analysis,"Asgari, A; Ramezanzadeh, A; Jalali, SME; Brouard, B",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT,10.22044/jme.2019.8357.1715,"[Asgari, A.; Ramezanzadeh, A.; Jalali, S.

WoS,Numerical Modeling of Rock Slopes with a Potential of Block-Flexural Toppling Failure,"One of the most important instabilities of rock slopes is toppling failure. Among the types of toppling failure, block-flexural failures are a more common instability, which occurs in nature. In this failure, some rock blocks break due to tensile stresses, and some overturn under their weights, and next to all of them topple together. In 2015, the physical and theoretical modeling of this failure has been studied by Amini et al. Due to the complexity of this failure mechanism, no appropriate numerical model has been proposed so far. In this research work, first, a literature review of the toppling failure is summarized. Then using the UDEC software, as a distinct element method (DEM), the experimental models are analyzed numerically, and the Voronoi joint model is applied to simulate the failure. The results of the numerical simulations are compared with the outcomes of the physical models and analytical solutions. This comparison illustrates that the numerical modeling has a good agreement with the corresponding experimental tests and theoretical approaches. Also the results obtained show that although the mechanism of block-flexural toppling failure is complicated, the numerical code is well-capable of analyzing this failure.",Rock Slopes; Block-Flexural Toppling; Numerical Modeling; Distinct Element Method,"Sarfaraz, H; Amini, M",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT,10.22044/jme.2019.8887.1778,"[Sarfaraz, H.; Amini, M.] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Min Engn, Thehram, Iran",SHAHROOD UNIV TECHNOLOGY,English,2251-8592,
WoS,Numerical Modelling of Backfill Grouting Approaches in EPB Tunneling,"One of the main issues involved during tunnel construction with tunnel boring machines is the tail gap grouting. This gap is between the external diameter of tunnel lining and the excavation boundary that is filled with high-pressure grouting materials. In this work, three different approaches of gap grouting modeling in the FLAC3D software are investigated with a special attention to the influence of the grout material hardening process. In the first approach, the grout is modeled as a liquid during injection, and considering the TBM advancement and its hardening time, the grout characteristics are changed to the properties of the solid grouting. In the second approach, the grouting material from the beginning of injection is considered with the properties of solid grouting in the model, and the liquid phase is ignored. In the third approach, without considering the back-filled grouting area in the model geometry, only the injection pressure is applied to the end of the shield and behind the installed segments. The validity of the approaches is evaluated with respect to the maximum ground surface settlement. All the three approaches estimate different surface settlement but the result of the first approach is closer to the monitoring data. Also as a sensitivity analysis, in this work, we investigate the effect of the elastic modulus of liquid and solid grouting materials on the amount of surface settlement that can help to gain a more accurate insight into the effect of grout mixture.",Tail gap; EPB-TBM; Grout hardening; FLAC3D; settlement,"Nikakhtar, L; Zare, S; Mirzaei-Nasirabad, H",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT,10.22044/jme.2020.9155.1805,"[Nikakhtar, L.; Zare, Sh] Shahrood Univ Technol, Fac Min Petr & Geophys Engn, Shahrood, Iran; [Mirzaei-Nasirabad, H.] Sahand Univ Technol, Fac Min Engn, Sahand, Tabriz, Iran",SHAHROOD UNIV TECHNOLOGY,English,2251-8592,

WoS,Accuracy and repeatability of wrist joint angles in boxing using an electromagnetic tracking system,"The hand-wrist region is reported as the most common injury site in boxing. Boxers are at risk due to the amount of wrist motions when impacting training equipment or their opponents, yet we know relatively little about these motions. This paper describes a new method for quantifying wrist motion in boxing using an electromagnetic tracking system. Surrogate testing procedure utilising a polyamide hand and forearm shape, and in vivo testing procedure utilising 29 elite boxers, were used to assess the accuracy and repeatability of the system. 2D kinematic analysis was used to calculate wrist angles using photogrammetry, whilst the data from the electromagnetic tracking system was processed with visual 3D software. The electromagnetic tracking system agreed with the video-based system (paired t tests) in both the surrogate (< 0.2 degrees) and quasi-static testing (< 6 degrees). Both systems showed a good intraclass coefficient of reliability (ICCs > 0.9). In the punch testing, for both repeated jab and hook shots, the electromagnetic tracking system showed good reliability (ICCs > 0.8) and substantial reliability (ICCs > 0.6) for flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation angles, respectively.

Hence, the present study was conducted to compare NRBC between discharged and dead neonates. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on preterm newborns with a birth weight of < 1,500 g admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, within 2012-2018. The subjects were divided into two groups of discharged and dead.

WoS,Relationship between Mothers' Spiritual Health Scores with Newborns' Physical Development Indices and Physiologic Parameters in Hazrat Zeinab Training Hospital,"Background: Spiritual health is one of the important factors predicting human health. This study aimed to determine the relationship between mothers' spiritual health with newborns' physical development indices and other physiologic parameters. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 155 mothers giving birth to newborns were selected from Hazrat Zeinab hospital during 2017-2018. The data were gathered through a checklist containing all mothers' and babies' demographic information. Moreover, we used Palutzian and Ellison's scale to measure the mothers' spiritual health score. To analyze the data, we used SPSS software (version 18). Results: The mothers' mean age was reported as 27.84 +/- 6.67 years. Moreover, 71.6% of the mothers' educational level was under diploma, and 65.2% of them were not employed (did not have any jobs). The mean score of the mothers' spiritual health was 75.96 +/- 8.75. In this regard, 97.4% of the subjects had a moderate level of spiritual health, and 2.6% of them had a high level of spiritual health. There was a significant negative correlation between the mothers' spiritual health score and neonates' physical development scores. However, this correlation was significant (height: r=-0.1, P=0.21; weight r=-0.058, P=0.47; size of head: r=-0.033, P=0.6; size of belly: r=0.047, P=0.56), and there were positive correlations between the mothers' spiritual health scores (heart beats: r=-0.034, P=0.66; percentage of saturated oxygen: r=-0.034, P=0.90; degree of heat: r=0.047, P=0.96). However, none of these correlations were statistically significant. Conclusion: In general, the results of this study showed that most of the mothers had a normal and high level of spiritual health, but a higher percentage of moderate level of spiritual health was observed in mothers, compared to those of other levels.

This study employs the ADE incorporating time-dependent dispersion and velocity and space-time dependent source and sink, expressed by one function. The dispersion theory allows mechanical dispersion to be directly proportional to seepage velocity. Initially the aquifer is assumed contaminant free and an additional source term is considered at the inlet boundary. A flux type boundary condition is considered in the semi-infinite part of the domain. Laplace transform technique (LTT) is then applied to obtain a closed form analytical solution. The effect of source/sink term as a function in the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation is explained through the graphical representation for the set of input data based on similar data available in hydrological literature.

WoS,Development of the Ethyl Ester from Jatropa Oil through Response Surface Methodology Approach,"With an increase in the global pollution, there is requirement for an alternative to the fossil fuels. Non-edible vegetable oils are highly promising for producing liquid fuels like diesel. Jatropha is a potential feedstock for biodiesel, currently utilized in India and many parts of the world. The optimization of reaction conditions such as temperature, time, catalyst and molar ratio for biodiesel production is important in reactor design. However, oils have characteristics reaction properties for optimum yield. Therefore, there is the need to identify such parameters in Jatropha oil ethyl esters production. Preparation of biodiesel from Jatropha oil ethyl esters using conventional homogeneous process. Optimization of Jatropha ethyl esters using Response surface methodology is done and data so obtained are fed to the design experiment software for analysis. The Jatropha ethyl esters yield was 92.62%.

WoS,"Towards Humanizing Language Teaching: Error Treatment and EFL Learners' Cognitive, Behavioral, Emotional Engagement, Motivation, and Language Achievement","This study elucidated how humanistic teaching as manifested in teachers' error correction influences EFL learners' engagement, motivation, and language achievement. the present study was carried out in a language Institute in Mashhad, Iran. The population comprised 42 advanced female learners. To investigate how error treatment will affect EFL learners' engagement, intrinsic motivation and language achievement, a mixed-methods design incorporating both quantitative (experimental design) and qualitative (interview & observation) methods (QUAN -> qual) was employed. The participants were divided into control and experimental groups. Speaking errors of the participants of the experimental group were corrected by three methods of corrective feedback including peer-correction, elicitation, and repetition, whereas, speaking errors of the participants of control group were directly corrected by the teacher. To measure the intrinsic motivation, the MSLQ questionnaire (Pintrich, et al., 1991) was employed. Students' engagement was determined through Tool-school engagement scale, which was assesses behavioral, emotional, and cognitive aspects of academic engagement (Fredericks, Blumenfeld, Friedel, & Paris, 2005). A Babel test was utilized to assess language proficiency. To examine the effect of corrective feedback on intrinsic interest, an independent samples t-test was run. The results substantiated the efficiency of corrective feedback in enhancing intrinsic motivation. A one-way between-groups multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was utilized to investigate the role of corrective feedback in Cognitive, Behavioral, and Emotional Engagement. It was revealed that all three types of engagement were influenced and the highest difference was observed in Emotional engagement and the lowest difference was obtained for Behavioral engagement. Regarding language achievement, the results implied that corrective feedback utilized in the experimental group resulted in higher language achievement. Twenty-five percent of the whole participants were interviewed after the term.

WoS,Various parameters in the preparation of chitosan/polyethylene oxide electrospun nanofibers containing Aloe vera extract for medical applications,"Objective(s): The present study aimed to fabricate chitosan/polyethylene oxide (CS/PEO) electrospun nanofibers loaded with Aloe vera extract for biomedical applications. The polymer-to-extract ratio and electrospinning parameters (applied voltage and nozzle-to-collector distance) were evaluated in order to optimize the process of nanofiber fabrication. Materials and Methods: The characterizations were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ImageJ software, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), tensile strength test, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Results: The obtained results indicated that the fabrication of nanofibers from pure Aloe vera extract was unsuccessful, and reducing the extract concentration from 100% to 92% resulted in the formation of the nanofibers. Moreover, further reduction in the extract from 92% to 50% led to the production of fine nanofibers (mean diameters: 204 +/- 42 and 398 +/- 51 nm, respectively). Therefore, it was concluded that the reduced concentration of the herbal extract increased the diameters of the prepared nanofibers. In addition, the results of the optimization process indicated a direct correlation between the applied voltage and nanofiber diameters, as well as an inverse correlation between the nozzle-to-collector distance and nanofiber diameters. The FTIR spectroscopy also confirmed the presence of CS, PEO, and Aloe vera in the final prepared scaffold. The release measurement revealed a burst effect within the first five hours, followed by a sustain release within 30 hours. Moreover, the biocompatibility assay confirmed the proliferative potential of Aloe vera within seven days. Conclusion: According to the results, a nanofibrous scaffold composed of CS and PEO could be fabricated as the carrier of Aloe vera extract, which is a suitable platform for biomedical applications.",Aloe Vera; Chitosan; Electrospinning; Nanofibers; Polyethylene oxide,"Nikbakht, M; Salehi, M; Rezayat, SM; Majidi, RF",2020.0,Journal,NANOMEDICINE JOURNAL,10.22038/nmj.2020.07.03,"[Nikbakht, Mohammad; Rezayat, Seyed Mahdi; Majidi, Reza Faridi] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Adv Technol Med, Dept Med Nanotechnol, Tehran, Iran; [Salehi, Majid] Shahroud Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Tissue Engn, Shahroud, Iran",MASHHAD UNIV MED SCIENCES,English,2322-3049,

Before the advent of computer technology, the damaged cultural relics would not be repaired due to cost. Computer vision technology has been applied to the restoration of cultural relics, mainly for the virtual restoration of damaged cultural relics images. This paper briefly introduced the Criminisi image restoration algorithm and the structure tensor used to improve the algorithm in the digital cultural relics image restoration. A damaged cultural relics image and a complete image which was damaged by human were repaired respectively using the classical Criminisi image restoration algorithm and the improved structure tensor based repair algorithm on MATLAB software. The results showed that the Criminisi image restoration algorithm could be used to repair the damaged images of ancient fabrics. It was found that the classical image restoration algorithm had some shortcomings, such as inappropriate texture structure, obvious repair marks and addition of redundant information, but the improved algorithm effectively avoided the above shortcomings. The peak signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the complete image which was damaged by human was compared objectively, and it was found that the improved algorithm had better restoration performance.",Digital; Relic restoration; Criminisi algorithm; Structure tensor,"Tang, H; Geng, GH; Zhou, MQ",2020.0,Journal,SENSING AND IMAGING,10.1007/s11220-019-0265-8,"[Geng, Guohua] Northwest Univ, Sch Informat & Technol, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tang, Hui] Xian Univ Finance & Econ, Xian 710100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Mingquan] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",SPRINGER,English,1557-2064,

WoS,Adaptive multi-parameter regularization approach to construct the distribution function of relaxation times,"Determination of the distribution function of relaxation times (DFRT) is an approach that gives us more detailed insight into system processes, which are not observable by simple electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. DFRT maps EIS data into a function containing the timescale characteristics of the system under consideration. The extraction of such characteristics from noisy EIS measurements can be described by Fredholm integral equation of the first kind that is known to be ill-posed and can be treated only with regularization techniques. Moreover, since only a finite number of EIS data may actually be obtained, the above-mentioned equation appears as after application of a collocation method that needs to be combined with the regularization. In the present study, we discuss how a regularized collocation of DFRT problem can be implemented such that all appearing quantities allow symbolic computations as sums of table integrals. The proposed implementation of the regularized collocation is treated as a multi-parameter regularization. Another contribution of the present work is the adjustment of the previously proposed multiple parameter choice strategy to the context of DFRT problem. The resulting strategy is based on the aggregation of all computed regularized approximants, and can be in principle used in synergy with other methods for solving DFRT problem. We also report the results from the experiments that apply the synthetic data showing that the proposed technique successfully reproduced known exact DFRT. The data obtained by our techniques is also compared to data obtained by well-known DFRT software (DRTtools).",EIS; DFRT; Ill-posed problem; Regularization,"Zic, M; Pereverzyev, S; Subotic, V; Pereverzyev, S",2020.0,Journal,GEM-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON GEOMATHEMATICS,10.1007/s13137-019-0138-2,"[Zic, Mark] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, POB 180, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Pereverzyev, Sergiy, Jr.] Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Neuroradiol, Anichstr 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Pereverzyev, Sergiy, Jr.] Med Univ Innsbruck, Neuroimaging Res Core Facil, Anichstr 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Subotic, Vanja] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Thermal Engn, Inffeldgasse 25b, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Pereverzyev, Sergei] Johann Radon Inst Computat & Appl Math, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,English,1869-2672,

WoS,Multiobjective Deployment of Data Analysis Operations in Heterogeneous IoT Infrastructure,"The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) technology brings many new opportunities for applications in areas including smart healthcare, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. These applications must normally distribute the computations, required for extracting value from sensor data, over the IoT infrastructure platforms (e.g., sensors, phones, field-gateways, and clouds). This can be very challenging for IoT application developers due to the heterogeneity of the aforementioned platforms, potentially conflicting nonfunctional requirements (e.g., battery power, latency, and cost), and related deployment criteria, which is impossible to resolve manually. To address the above challenges, we have developed the PATH2iot framework that decomposes a complex IoT application into self-contained micro-operations. Based on the deployment criteria, PATH2iot automatically distributes the set of micro-operations across IoT infrastructure platforms, while respecting their run-time data and control flow dependencies. In our previous work, we have shown how to use the PATH2iot to optimize the battery life of a healthcare wearable. In this article, we describe a new research that significantly extends PATH2iot, which introduces a heuristic model capable of making optimal deployment decisions based on multiple conflicting nonfunctional requirements and selection criteria (user preferences). It does so by leveraging a well-known multicriteria decision-making method called the analytic hierarchical processes (AHP). The applicability of the deployment model is validated based on a real-world digital healthcare analytics use case.

To overcome the high computational cost of deep neural networks, spiking neural networks (SNN) have been proposed. Herein, we propose a hardware implementation of the SNN with gated Schottky diodes as synaptic devices. In addition, we apply L1 regularization for connection pruning of the deep spiking neural networks using gated Schottky diodes as synaptic devices. Applying L1 regularization eliminates the need for a re-training procedure because it prunes the weights based on the cost function. The compressed hardware-based SNN is energy efficient while achieving a classification accuracy of 97.85% which is comparable to 98.13% of the software deep neural networks (DNN).",Neuromorphic; Deep Spiking Neural Networks; Pruning; Synaptic Device; Gated Schottky Diode,"Lee, ST; Lim, S; Bae, JH; Kwon, D; Kim, HS; Park, BG; Lee, JH",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY,10.1166/jnn.2020.18772,"[Lee, Jong-Ho] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; Seoul Natl Univ, ISRC Interuniv Semicond Res Ctr, Seoul 08826, South Korea",AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,English,1533-4880,
WoS,Analysis of reattachment length dynamics in cavities,"Recirculation zone dynamics in a cavity located in the bottom wall of a water channel with height h = 0.3 mm and width b = 0.9 mm are investigated experimentally and numerically. A microparticle image velocimetry method and instrumentation are used for the experimental determination of flow velocity distribution and reattachment pattern with Reynolds number from Re-Dh = 30-2000, cavity length to depth ratios of L/h(1) = 10 and 16, and channel expansion ratios of H/h = 1.3, 1.5, 2, 3, and 5. Numerical simulation using commercially available Ansys Fluent software is conducted for analysis of the influence of flow regime and cavity dimensions by changing Re-Dh, L/h(1), and H/h in the ranges of (1-10(5)), (8-36) and (1.25-5), respectively. The experimental and numerical simulation results show that in a laminar flow regime reattachment length increases with increasing Re-Dh in the same manner as in flow over a backward-facing step. Re-h1 and H/h are the main scaling parameters for the reattachment length. However, the results suggest that the transition to a turbulent flow regime occurs earlier due to the small channel spanwise aspect ratio AR = b/h = 3. Re-h1 approximate to 500 and Re-h1 approximate to 2000 are the critical values that determine the onset of flow transition from a laminar to a turbulent regime and the onset of fully developed turbulent flow, respectively. In addition, it is found that the influence degree of channel expansion ratio depends on whether H/h > 2 or H/h < 2.",Cavity flow; Reattachment length; Shear layer separation; Recirculation zone dynamics,"Vilkinis, P; Pedisius, N",2020.0,Journal,EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE,10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2020.110211,"[Vilkinis, Paulius; Pedisius, Nerijus] Lithuanian Energy Inst, Lab Heat Equipment Res & Testing, Breslaujos Str 3, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania",ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,English,0894-1777,

WoS,How important is cognitive ability when adapting to changes? A meta-analysis of the performance adaptation literature,"Performance adaptation is required in many areas (e.g., dealing with emergencies or new software in the work and educational context). Therefore, predicting successful reactions to changes is important. Motivated by heterogeneous findings, the present meta-analysis examines to what extent individual differences in cognitive abilities are relevant to performance adaptation. A three-level meta-analysis based on 133 correlations (N = 37,963) was conducted in order to estimate the mean strength of the relationship. Furthermore, several moderator analyses were carried out (e.g., task complexity, subjective vs objective assessment of performance adaptation) to explain the variability of the effect sizes. As expected, cognitive ability was positively related to performance adaptation (r = 0.21). However, the relationship was stronger when objective performance adaptation scores (r = 0.25) rather than subjective ratings were used (r = 0.11). Furthermore, cognitive ability seems to be particularly relevant for highly dynamic tasks (r = 0.31). Overall, cognitive ability can be a useful predictor of actual performance adaptation, which has implications for the selection context (e.g., selection of students or employees with high adaptability). Furthermore, cognitive ability seems to be more relevant than other personality-based predictors of performance adaptation that have been examined meta-analytically (Big Five and goal orientation).",Adaptive performance; Adaptability; Cognitive ability; Performance adaptation; Meta-analysis,"Stasielowicz, L",2020.0,Review,PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES,10.1016/j.paid.2020.110178,"[Stasielowicz, Lukasz] Osnabruck Univ, Inst Psychol, Seminarstr 20, D-49074 Osnabruck, Germany",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0191-8869,
WoS,On the design of hardware architectures for parallel frequent itemsets mining,"Algorithms for Frequent Itemsets Mining have proved their effectiveness for extracting frequent sets of patterns in datasets. However, in some specific cases, they do not obtain the expected results in an acceptable time. For this reason, Field Programmable Gates Array-based architectures for Frequent Itemsets Mining have been proposed to accelerate this task. The current paper proposes a search strategy for Frequent Itemsets Mining based on equivalence classes partitioning. The partitioning on equivalence classes allows dividing the search space into disjoint sets that can be processed in parallel. Consequently, this paper presents the design and implementation of two hardware architectures that exploit the nested parallelism in the proposed search strategy. These hardware architectures are capable of obtaining frequent itemsets regardless of the number of distinct items and the number of transactions in the dataset, which are the main issues reported in the reviewed literature. Furthermore, the proposed architectures explore the trade-off between acceleration and hardware resource utilization. The experimental results obtained demonstrate that the proposed search strategy can be scaled to achieve a speedup in the processing time of 40 times faster than software-based implementations.

WoS,Continuous outlier mining of streaming data in flink,"In this work, we focus on distance-based outliers in a metric space, where the status of an entity as to whether it is an outlier is based on the number of other entities in its neighborhood. In recent years, several solutions have tackled the problem of distance-based outliers in data streams, where outliers must be mined continuously as new elements become available. An interesting research problem is to combine the streaming environment with massively parallel systems to provide scalable stream-based algorithms. However, none of the previously proposed techniques refer to a massively parallel setting. Our proposal fills this gap and investigates the challenges in transferring state-of-the-art techniques to Apache Flink, a modern platform for intensive streaming analytics. We thoroughly present the technical challenges encountered and the alternatives that may be applied, of which a micro-clustering-based one is the most efficient. We show speed-ups of up to 2.27 times over advanced non-parallel solutions, by using just an ordinary four-core machine and a real-world dataset. When moving to a three-machine cluster, due to less contention, we manage to achieve both better scalability in terms of the window slide size and the data dimensionality, and even higher speed-ups, e.g., by a factor of more than 11X. Overall, our results demonstrate that outlier mining can be achieved in an efficient and scalable manner. The resulting techniques have been made publicly available as open-source software.

WoS,Influence of geometry and surface morphology of the U-tube on the fluid flow in the range of various velocities,"This paper focuses on evaluation of differences in the newly manufactured U-tubes and ones after operation. Differences in geometry and internal surface roughness were investigated and a flow simulation was carried out in the Ansys Fluent software, where properties such as flow nature, maximum velocity and pressure drop were examined. A numerical model validation process was carried out with an application of PIV experiments. The digital models of the U-tube were obtained with an application of computer tomography. As a result of the tests, it has been noticed that the U-tube after operation has a much more distorted cross-sectional shape comparing to the shape of the new one. Moreover, the U-tube after operation is characterized by a 3-fold higher average surface roughness Sa value than one obtained in the new tube. The maximum flow velocities for the tube after operation are about 3.4% higher than ones reached for theoretical tube. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

WoS,Under the background of healthy China: Regulating the analysis of hybrid machine learning in sports activities to control chronic diseases,"One of the most important concerns in human life is concentrating on health. Major threats to human life are chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes. China government mainly focusing on understanding the progression and spreading of chronic diseases over the population for allocating medical resources and designing a strategy in healthcare. Various conventional methods have been used for fetching chronic disease indicators in large scale based on the population health. But they are costly, not time effective and less accuracy in prediction. But this paper used Hybrid Predicting Model designed by incorporating the main features of the Gaussian Mixture Method and Collaborating Topic Modelling to increase the predic-tion accuracy. The proposed HPM method experimented on human mobility pattern dataset collected from the various metropolitan area of China. From the dataset, HPM predicts the rate of chronic disease presence and relative activity. GMM obtain the health condition whereas CTM obtains the data sparsity. The proposed hybrid prediction method is implemented in MATLAB software and experimented. Form the obtained results and comparing with the other existing methods, it is identified that the HPM outper-forms in terms of prediction accuracy. HPM is evaluated using real-time check-in and chronic disease dataset in China cities. The proposed HPM method obtained 0.09% of the value which is high than the other baseline methods. From the obtained MSE and value, it is well clear the proposed HPM outperforms than the baseline methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,264-channel high-performance magnetic field detection system for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),"To calibrate transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) devices before clinical trials, a 264-channel high-performance magnetic field detection system for TMS is proposed in this paper. The magnetic field detection system consists of three parts: 3D magnetic field measurement sensor (MFMS) array, 264-channel data acquisition (DAQ) card and monitor software. The 3D MFMS array is made of induction coils according to the structure of human brain. The DAQ card has 264 channels, with 4 MSps/ch maximum sampling rate and 14-bit resolution, and a good signal noise and distortion (SINAD) and crosstalk of 65.1 dB and -83.4 dB respectively. FPGA is used to control and process high-speed signals in the DAQ card. The monitor software is developed in QtCreator5.12 to process, display and backup data. The system, which is suitable for various TMS devices, can detect TMS magnetic field in real time with a relative error (RE) of 2.19%. Finally, the proposed system is used to calibrate our TMS device. The results show a good match between measurements and simulations of the TMS device with an average RE of 3.72%, which proves the system has outstanding advantages in multi-channel, synchronization, dynamic performance, data throughput, data visualization and so on.

WoS,Research hotspots and effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in stroke rehabilitation,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, as a relatively new type of rehabilitation treatment, is a painless and non-invasive method for altering brain excitability. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been widely used in the neurorehabilitation of stroke patients. Here, we used CiteSpace software to visually analyze 315 studies concerning repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for stroke rehabilitation from 1999 to 2019, indexed by Web of Science, to clarify the research hotspots in different periods and characterize the gradual process of discovery in this field. We found that four main points were generally accepted: (1) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a positive effect on motor function recovery in patients with subcortical stroke; (2) it may be more advantageous for stroke patients to receive low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the unaffected hemispheres than to receive high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in affected hemisphere; (3) low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has become a potential therapeutic tool for patients with non-fluent aphasia after chronic stroke for neurological rehabilitation and language recovery; and (4) there are some limitations to these classic clinical studies, such as small sample size and low test efficiency. Our assessment indicates that prospective, multi-center, large-sample, randomized controlled clinical trials are still needed to further verify the effectiveness of various repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation programs for the rehabilitation of stroke patients.",,"Xu, AH; Sun, YX",2020.0,Journal,NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH,10.4103/1673-5374.282269,"[Xu, Ai-Hua; Sun, Yong-Xin] China Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Rehabil Med, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China",WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,English,1673-5374,
WoS,QWEB: High-Performance Event-Driven Web Architecture With QAT Acceleration,"Hardware accelerators have been a promising solution to reduce the cost of cloud datacenters. This article investigates the acceleration of an important datacenter workload: the web server (or proxy) that faces high computational consumption originated from SSL/TLS processing and HTTP compression. Our study reveals that for the widely-deployed event-driven web architecture, the straight offloading of SSL/TLS or compression tasks suffers from frequent blockings in the offload I/O, leading to the underutilization of both CPU and accelerator resources. To achieve efficient acceleration, we propose QWEB, a comprehensive offload solution based on Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT). QWEB introduces an asynchronous offload mode for SSL/TLS processing and a pipelining offload mode for HTTP compression, both allowing concurrent offload tasks from a single application process/thread. With these two novel offload modes, the blocking penalty is amortized or even eliminated, and the utilization rate of the parallel computation engines inside the QAT accelerator is greatly increased. The evaluation shows that QWEB provides up to 9x handshake performance with TLS-RSA (2048-bit) over the software baseline. Additionally, the secure data transfer throughput is enhanced by 2x for the SSL/TLS offloading only, 3.5x for the compression offloading only and 5x for the combined offloading.",Computer architecture; Service-oriented architecture; Servers; Elliptic curve cryptography; Pipeline processing; Acceleration; Accelerator; event-driven web architecture; SSL; TLS; HTTP compression; Offload I; O; concurrency,"Li, J; Hu, XK; Qian, D; Wei, CZ; McFadden, G; Will, B; Yu, P; Li, WG; Guan, HB",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS,10.1109/TPDS.2020.2999353,"[Li, Jian; Hu, Xiaokang; Guan, Haibing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Qian, David; Wei, Changzheng; McFadden, Gordon; Will, Brian; Yu, Ping; Li, Weigang] Intel Corp, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,English,1045-9219,
WoS,Extensive screening of cyclopeptide toxins in mushrooms by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry,"A non-target screening method of cyclopeptide toxins and their analogues in mushroom was developed, using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPL-CQ-Orbitrap MS) followed by mass spectrometry databases retrieval and software tools analysis for the candidate analogues. Three cyclopeptide toxins in the toxic mushroom Amanita rimosa were firstly screened without standard, and two of them were unknown analogues which were tentatively identified by the accurate masses, isotopic patterns and characteristic fragments. A validated quantitative method was performed to rapidly quantify three major cyclopeptide toxins in the Amanita rimosa sample including alpha-manitin, beta-amanitin and phalloidin, and their contents were detected to be 4.52 mg/kg, 2.37 mg/kg and 2.53 mg/kg, respectively. The developed method has good selectivity and sensitivity for rapid and comprehensive screening the cyclopeptide toxins and their analogues in mushrooms at trace levels.

WoS,On hysteresis modeling of a piezoelectric precise positioning system under variable temperature,"We propose the modeling of hysteresis nonlinearities in a piezoelectric material-based tube actuator classically employed in precise positioning applications under different surrounding temperatures. Beyond the voltage-to-displacement hysteresis nonlinearities they exhibit, these actuators are sensitive to the surrounding temperature. Therefore, contrary to the existing works in the literature where the two phenomena were treated individually, this paper suggests to model the hysteresis nonlinearities and the temperature effects simultaneously. First an experimental study was performed to investigate the effects of the surrounding temperature on the voltage-to-displacement hysteresis loops of the piezoelectric tube actuators. The experimental results show that increasing the input surrounding temperature contributes an increase in the voltage-to-displacement sensitivity of the piezoelectric tube actuator under the input voltage range considered in the experimental tests. Then, two different nonlinear temperature-dependent hysteresis models a temperature-dependent (TD) electromechanical model and a temperature-dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii model (TD-PI) were proposed to account the temperature effects on the hysteresis nonlinearity. In First, the mathematical formulation of TD-electromechanical model was presented to describe the electrical and mechanical properties of piezoelectric tube actuator. This model integrates the temperature dependent electromechanical coupling factor to model the temperature effects, the Simscape library in MATLAB-Simulink software was used to develop a physical simulation for the TD-electromechanical model. In a second time, a TD-PI model was proposed to describe the voltage-to-displacement characteristic of piezoelectric tube actuator using a proposed temperature shape function. The parameters of the two proposed models were estimated using proposed optimization algorithms based on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The modeling results demonstrate that the two proposed models can account for the hysteresis nonlinearities of the piezoelectric tube actuators under different levels of the surrounding temperatures. Finally, the analytical inverse of TD-PI model was derived and applied in feed forward manner to compensate the hysteresis nonlinearities under different levels of the surrounding temperatures.

WoS,Genetic Status of the Swedish Central collection of heirloom apple cultivars,"Cultivated apple is one of the most widely grown fruit crops worldwide. With the introduction of modern apple cultivars, from foreign and national breeding programs, the use of local cultivars decreased during the 20th century. In order to minimize genetic erosion and avoid loss of special genotypes, a number of local clonal archives were established across Sweden, with the goal of retaining old and local cultivars. About 220 apple cultivars, appointed for preservation, obtained the status of mandate cultivars. Initially, they were identified based on pomological traits, but prior to the establishment of the Swedish Central Collection they were genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. SSR markers helped to evaluate the status of the preserved material, as well as to find the best possible true-to-type source for propagation, thus guiding the establishment of the Central Collection. Recently, 215 accessions from this collection were genotyped using the 20 K apple Infinium (R) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, in order to gain insight into its genetic structure. The initial SSR analysis confirmed the identity of multiple samples with the same cultivar name grown in different locations and identified several mislabeled samples. In the subsequent SNP analysis we identified 30 clonal relationships and a number of parent-offspring relationships, including 18 trios. We also identified five cultivar samples with inconsistent ploidy levels between the SNP and SSR data, in some cases indicating problematic samples preserved in either the Central Collection or some of the local clonal archives. These cultivars need further investigation to ensure their true-to-typeness. Furthermore, the Swedish Central Collection has continued to grow since the onset of this work and now contains additional cultivars, which should be included in future studies. The results indicate that a number of the preserved mandate cultivars holds high potential value for modern breeding programs.",Malus domestica; SNP array; Genotyping; Pedigree; Gene bank; Local cultivars; SSR markers,"af Satra, JS; Troggio, M; Odilbekov, F; Sehic, J; Mattisson, H; Hjalmarsson, I; Ingvarsson, PK; Garkava-Gustavsson, L",2020.0,Journal,SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE,10.1016/j.scienta.2020.109599,"[af Satra, Jonas Skytte; Odilbekov, Firuz; Mattisson, Helena; Garkava-Gustavsson, Larisa] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Breeding, Alnarp, Sweden; [Troggio, Michela] Fdn Edmund Mach, Res & Innovat Ctr, San Michele All Adige, Trento, Italy; [Sehic, Jasna] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Breeding Balsgard, Fjalkestadsvagen 459, S-29194 Kristianstad, Sweden; [Hjalmarsson, Inger] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture Planning & Management, Alnarp, Sweden; [Ingvarsson, Par K.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Plant Biol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",ELSEVIER,English,0304-4238,
WoS,Root distribution and seasonal fluctuations under different grove floor management systems in citrus,"Grove floor management practices play a significant role in citrus physiology, root distribution, and overall tree health. Among the various agricultural practices evaluated in this study, black plastic mesh groundcovers showed increasing soil moisture availability and temperature, as well as improving plant growth and yields. Raised bed practices have also been used to increase soil drainage and porosity to promote root proliferation in compacted soils. While these practices have been primarily studied on annual or row crops, their introduction into grove systems has been slow, even the positive results obtained with these practices. Citrus are managed very differently from row crops, with long-term practices and management techniques often negatively impacting root growth. Citrus management practices using raised beds and black plastic mesh groundcovers have shown great promise in improving citrus production and tree growth. However, few studies have investigated the impact of these practices on root growth and morphology and how these practices affect aboveground growth and production. In this experiment, we aimed to evaluate how different practices affected root growth and how this, in turn, impacted aboveground parameters. To accomplish this, we examined root distribution and in-growth (root growth inside a hand-made core) in four different citrus grove floor management systems; raised bed with groundcover, raised bed without groundcover, flatbed with groundcover, and flatbed without groundcover at various times throughout the growing season for three years. We then assessed how each treatment parameter affected root characteristics and how this affected the aboveground and soil measurements. Root analysis with WinRhizo (R) software showed significant differences between management systems. Raised beds with black plastic groundcovers increased root growth and density throughout the study. Seasonal ingrowth core data indicated that the period from Fall-Spring showed significantly higher root growth than the Spring-Fall period, indicating seasonal growth and senescence of roots. The Spring-Fall cores were also less influenced by management treatment than the other sampling dates. While short-term growth varied with season, the effects of raised beds with plastic groundcovers positively influenced tree growth, root growth, and morphology over the long-term.",Grapefruit; Root in-growth; Black plastic mesh; Water conservation,"Simpson, CR; Gonzales, J; Enciso, J; Nelson, SD; Setamou, M",2020.0,Journal,SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE,10.1016/j.scienta.2020.109364,"[Simpson, C.

WoS,Interfacial behavior of cement stabilized rammed earth: Experimental and numerical study,"Cement stabilised rammed earth (CSRE) is a modern earth construction technology witnessing renewed interest by researchers worldwide due to its improved strength and durability vis-a-vis un-stabilised rammed earth (URE). Rammed earth walls are predominantly subjected to compressive loading and occasionally to lateral loads. Strength and deformation ability of interface in rammed earth plays a vital role in case of in-plane lateral loads. The present study focuses on assessing the performance of interface layers in cement stabilized rammed earth elements. Triplet test is conducted on CSRE specimens under dry and saturated condition. Three types of bonding techniques are considered for the interface in CSRE triplets, namely, (i) formation of dents (ii) coating cement slurry across interfacial area (iii) combination of dents and slurry. The influence of stresses normal to the interface of CSRE triplet is also explored in this study. Further, a finite element simulation of the CSRE triplet test is performed. A finite element model of the CSRE triplet is developed by using ABAQUS software. Eight node brick elements are adopted to model the CSRE material and interface. Linear elastic material model is adopted for the CSRE material whereas a PPR-potential based cohesive model is adopted for the interface. Shear stress-displacement curve obtained from the finite element model and experiment are compared with each other and were found to be in reasonable agreement. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Analysis of deformation behavior and microscopic characteristics of asphalt mixture based on interface contact-slip test,"To analyze the slip deformation behavior of asphalt mixture, an interface contact-slip tester of asphalt mixture was developed in this investigation. Four evaluation indicators, including the maximum slip shear stress tau(sl), the slip shear strain epsilon(S), the slip failure modulusE(S) and the interface slip energy index E-T, were proposed. According to the correlation and sensitivity analysis, the optimum evaluation indicator was determined. By analyzing the variation coefficient of test results, the key experiment parameters were recommended. The gray binarization method of MATLAB software was adopted to process the slip failure surface of specimen, and the bonding ratio B-n was calculated to analyze the effect of asphalt bonding on strength formation. Based on the deformation curve, the slip deformation behavior of asphalt mixture and the influence factors were analyzed from the microscopic perspective. Results obtained indicated that the optimum test conditions are the loading head of 28.5 mm, the diameter of the support ring of 80 mm, and the loading rate of 5 mm/min. The tau(sl) was selected as the evaluation indicator of slip deformation behavior due to the best correlation with RD, good stability and sensitivity. The bonding effect of asphalt binder is greater than particle contact effect for suspended-dense asphalt mixture. The slip deformation of asphalt mixture can be divided into five stages, including densification, elastic deformation, viscoelastic deformation, initial cracking and plasticity slip deformation. The contact from coarse aggregates and bonding from asphalt binder can enhance the slip deformation resistibility. While the interference of fine particles and the lubrication of asphalt can accelerate the slip deformation of asphalt mixture. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Characterization of Organic Matter in Water from Oil and Gas Wells Hydraulically Fractured with Recycled Water,"Liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed to understand how frac fluid with recycled water (RWA) and frac fluid with fresh water (FWA) compare when subjected to downhole temperature and oxidation conditions. Ethylene oxide and propylated glycol functional units were quantified from both RWA and FWA. Qualitative analysis was performed using Agilent qualitative analysis software B.06.00 based on the exact mass of the chemical compound. Acetone, aldol, alkoxylated phenol formaldehyde resin, diethylbenzene, dipropylene glycol, d-Limonene, ether salt, ethylbenzene, n-dodecyl-2-pyrrolidone, dodecylbenzenesulfonate isopropanolamine, polyethylene glycol, and triethylene glycol were detected in FWA and RWA samples. In the van Krevelen diagram, FWA and RWA show a low degree of oxidation and highly saturated organic compounds. Kendrick mass defect (KMD) analysis was applied using ethylene oxide and propylated glycol units. KMD analysis based on ethylene oxide was scattered between 0 and 0.1, while some KMD analyses based on the propylated glycol are close to 1. FWA had an average carbon number of 32.3 and double bond equivalent (DBE) of 9.8 while RWA had average carbon number of 31.5 and DBE of 9.5.

WoS,Model-based information navigation for engineering documents,"Engineering and the manner in which engineers think is largely visual and functional, and yet engineers are typically provided with search engines that are text-based. While software based on a visual and functional ethos exist (CAD for example), when searching for information engineers are still required to enter a text query into a search box. This process holds potential incompatibilities both with the nature of the data (i.e. 3D models) and with the way in which engineers think and work. Consequentially, the proposition tested in this paper is that a model-based approach to information access, i.e. a representation of an organisations information around a model of an artefact i.e. CAD model, can improve engineering information retrieval. In an A-B test with a traditional text-based search engine, and using study questions derived from real-world information seeking scenarios based on the activities of a world-leading aircraft manufacturer, the results presented in this paper suggest that there is merit to such an approach. Specifically, this paper shows that there is no significant difference in time to complete a search between a model-based and text-based interfaces in spite of the addition of a new stage in the search process (navigating a 3D model); that the system structure of the model-based interface allows for non-text based documents to be indexed, making up for the inherent limitations in traditional text-based search; and that participants enjoy using the model-based interface and find it intuitive, easy and simple to use. Further, this paper also finds that those with more experience/familiar with the product structure and those in managerial positions are more likely to find information using a model-based interface that those who are not, who perform better using a text-based interface.

WoS,Nonlinear MPC for Collision Avoidance and Control of UAVs With Dynamic Obstacles,"This letter proposes a Novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for navigation and obstacle avoidance of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The proposed NMPC formulation allows for a fully parametric obstacle trajectory, while in this letter we apply a classification scheme to differentiate between different kinds of trajectories to predict future obstacle positions. The trajectory calculation is done from an initial condition, and fed to the NMPC as an additional input. The solver used is the nonlinear, non-convex solver Proximal Averaged Newton for Optimal Control (PANOC) and its associated software OpEn (Optimization Engine), in which we apply a penalty method to properly consider the obstacles and other constraints during navigation. The proposed NMPC scheme allows for real-time solutions using a sampling time of 50 ms and a two second prediction of both the obstacle trajectory and the NMPC problem, which implies that the scheme can be considered as a local path-planner. This letter will present the NMPC cost function and constraint formulation, as well as the methodology of dealing with the dynamic obstacles.

WoS,"Automated, Convenient and Compact Auto-correlation Measurement for an Ultra-fast Laser Pulse","An ultrashort pulse laser is being used at the Schlesinger center for compact accelerators in Ariel University. The pulse duration ranges from 10 ps to 35 fs and can be varied using a grating, controlled by a remote control. However, there is no real-time indication of its duration while changing the grating position. This laser hits a copper cathode which results in ejection of electrons that serve as free electrons for a THz free electron laser (FEL). Extracting electrons from a copper cathode requires more energetic photons than IR, and therefore the laser's frequency is tripled (from 800 to 266 nm) using non-linear crystals. The conversion efficiency of the third harmonic generation setup is greater for pulses shorter than 50 fs. In order to properly tune the pulse duration a method to measure the pulse duration in real-time is required. Generally, in order to measure an event, one should use a shorter event than the one being measured. For ultra-short laser pulses, using shorter events to measure the pulse is impossible. Hence, we use the method of auto-correlation which means we harness the pulse itself in order to measure its duration. We used 3DOptix components to build an autocorrelator setup, resulting with a significantly more compact set-up, and very easy to align. We controlled the measurement by a dedicated software we developed for this purpose. Methods and information of the elements in the autocorrelator system are presented, and the necessary requirements to simplify the alignment and measuring procedures are outlined in this paper.",,"Farag, A; Nause, A",2020.0,Journal,INSTRUMENTS AND EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES,10.1134/S0020441220040028,"[Farag, Aviv; Nause, Ariel] Ariel Univ, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel",MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA/SPRINGER,English,0020-4412,
WoS,A new improved vertical comb type differential capacitive sensing micro accelerometer using silicon-on-insulator wafer technology,"A new and improved approach using vertical combs for the differential capacitive sensing of acceleration using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer technology is presented. The design, which supports a +/- 30 g operational range demonstrates the enhanced linear range that is achievable using an SOI approach, which overcomes the limitations of the dissolved wafer process (DWP) technology based on the diffusion layer depth in silicon, used for the fabrication of MEMS accelerometers. Two technological approaches are compared, one having the same thicknesses of fixed and movable interdigitated fingers (DWP) and the other having different thicknesses, using an SOI wafer. A remarkable sensitivity improvement, by a factor of up to two, is achieved for the capacitance change per unit g (deltaC g(-1)) using the new differential SOI design presented here. The bandwidth of the device is also improved significantly in the SOI design, compared to the DWP design. Furthermore, the effect of temperature (-40 degrees C to 125 degrees C) has an almost negligible influence on (deltaC) due to the built-in differential concept of comb-type fingers compared to DWP technology. Cross-axis sensitivity is also very low due to the stable, robust design of the accelerometer offering less stiction sideways and better pull-in stability. Simple analytical relations for dynamically changing overlap capacitance are derived and presented. These analytical results are compared with simulations using Coventorware software and are in agreement to within 1.8% in a linear range of operation up to a tip deflection of 8.5 mu m. The effects of fabrication tolerances, including all the process steps, on the sensitivity (deltaC g(-1)) and bandwidth (BW), are also studied and the results presented. An overall figure of merit (FOM) is included which is better in this study compared to the available literature. Furthermore, only two wafers are needed to fabricate the proposed differential capacitive sensors, compared to conventional push-pull three plate systems using three wafers.

The monopile foundation 5 MW OWT provided by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was selected for this study. The transition zone of the monopile OWT subjected to wind and wave loadings, the grout connection of the tower to the monopile, was specifically simulated with three different models using the ANSYS software. The three models included a plain model resembling the installed monopile, a shear key model considering the Det Norske Veritas (DNV) updated design, and a retrofit model incorporating the plain model with the bolted connection installed. Numerical results of three different transition models were compared to determine the efficacy of the proposed retrofit solution. Along with the numerical results, the proposed retrofit bolted con-nection was optimized through implementation of response surface methodology (RSM) with six input para-meters (e.g., bolt diameter) and three outputs (e.g., fatigue life). With the RSM data, the desirability function was employed on three different runs, in an attempt to obtain the most optimal retrofit bolted connection for the monopile OWT. A key finding indicated the optimized configuration of the bolted connection with high strength bolts of 0.036 m diameter to be installed in eight columns and five rows exceeded the required fatigue life.",Optimized retrofit; Monopile foundation; Offshore wind turbine; Finite element analysis; Response surface methodology,"Schaffer, W; Seo, J; Choi, E; Lee, J",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.111001,"[Schaffer, William; Seo, Junwon] South Dakota State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Choi, Eunsoo] Hongik Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Seoul 04066, South Korea; [Lee, Jaeha] Korea Maritime & Ocean Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 609 Engn Bldg 2, Busan, South Korea",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0141-0296,
WoS,Dynamic analysis of the train-bridge system considering the non-linear behaviour of the track-deck interface,"This article presents an efficient computational methodology for solving the train-track-bridge interaction problem, including track irregularities and considering the non-linear behaviour of the track-deck interface. One of the novelties of the work is the proposal of a specific finite element used to model the track-deck interface, based on an assembly of a friction contact element and a non-linear spring, which is generally not used in non-linear dynamic problems. This element automatically performs changes in the longitudinal resistance of the track, according to the positions of the traffic loads, and takes into account the loading history. The dynamic analyses are performed based on an iterative methodology implemented in AIVE software, which takes ad-vantage of the advanced modeling tools of Abaqus software controlled on Matlab. This software ensures flex-ibility in the selection of the methods for solving the dynamic problem and allows the incorporation of non-linearities in the vehicle and bridge models, including their interfaces. A parametric study was performed in order to demonstrate the importance of including the non-linear behaviour at the track-deck interface in the evaluation of the dynamic responses of the bridge and vehicle subsystems, under different scenarios of deck temperature, horizontal stiffness of the supports and deck cross-sections. The results show that the responses of the track-deck interface are more influenced by the effects of temperature variations than by the effects of vertical traffic loads, particularly for medium and large span bridges. Significant plastic incursions were detected at the track-deck interface under realistic temperature scenarios, particularly on the side of the mobile support. Under vertical traffic loads, the extension of the regions with plastic behaviour proved to be sensitive to var-iations in the horizontal stiffness of the support. Additionally, another important achievement of this study was the evaluation of the plastic incursions at the track-deck interface for different bridges typologies. Relevant incursions were detected for medium and large span bridges, where the extension of these regions can reach 25-55% of the bridge span, otherwise, for short span bridges, practically no significant plasticized regions were identified. Non-linear incursions on the track-deck interface cause an overall reduction of the track-bridge stiffness, leading to an increase of the vertical movements of the bridge, and, inherently, of the vehicle's dynamic responses. The evaluation of the extension of the ballast plastic regions for the different analysis scenarios, which is still a topic shortly addressed in the bibliography, will be particularly useful for upgrading the existing methods for assessment of the dynamic behavior of railway bridges.",Train-track-bridge system; Dynamic analyses; Iterative method; Track-deck interface; Non-linear behaviour; Parametric study,"Melo, LRT; Malveiro, J; Ribeiro, D; Calcada, R; Bittencourt, T",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110980,"[Ticona Melo, L.

WoS,Tyr-nitration in maize CDKA;1 results in lower affinity for ATP binding,"Cyclin-dependent kinase A (CDKA) is a key component for cell cycle progression. The catalytic kinase activity depends on the protein's ability to form an active complex with cyclins and on phosphoregulatory mechanisms. Cell cycle arrest and plant growth impairment under abiotic stress have been linked to different molecular processes triggered by increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS). Among these, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of key proteins such as CDKA;1 may be of significance. Herein, isolated maize embryo axes were subjected to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as an inductor of nitrosative conditions to evaluate if CDKA;1 protein was a target for RNS. A high degree of protein nitration was detected; this included the specific Tyr-nitration of CDKA;1. Tyr15 and Tyr19, located at the ATP-binding site, were the selective targets for nitration according to both in silico analysis using the predictive software GPS-YNO2 , and in vitro mass spectrometry studies of recombinant nitrated ZmCDKA;1. Spectrofluorometric measurements demonstrated a reduction of ZmCDKA;1-NO2 affinity for ATP. From these results, we conclude that Tyr nitration in CDKA;1 could act as an active modulator of cell cycle progression during redox stress.",Protein nitration; ATP; Zea mays L.; Maize cyclin-dependent kinase A;1,"Mendez, AAE; Mangialavori, IC; Cabrera, AV; Benavides, MP; Vazquez-Ramos, JM; Gallego, SM",2020.0,Journal,BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-PROTEINS AND PROTEOMICS,10.1016/j.bbapap.2020.140479,"[Mendez, Andrea A.

WoS,"Relations of land cover, topography, and climate to fire occurrence in natural regions of Iran: Applying new data mining techniques for modeling and mapping fire danger","In recent years, land uses have been changing and aridity has been increasing in the forests and rangelands of central Koohdasht which is a region in the forests of the Zagros Mountains in western Iran. Consequently, the number of fires has also increased. This study employs data-mining techniques to model fire danger using information regarding land cover, climate, topography, and other fire-danger influencing factors. A land cover map was prepared using Sentinel-2A satellite images and a maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm. Digital data describing other factors that influence fire danger (slope angle, aspect, elevation, climate, topographic wetness index, and distances from rivers and roads) were compiled from several sources and imported into a GIS. The locations of past fires in the study area were also determined from MODIS satellite images and data acquired from the region's fire service. The quantitative and qualitative spatial relationships between effective factors and patterns of fires were investigated to model fire danger. A new machine-learning algorithm (the Boruta algorithm) was used to assess the relative importance of the fire-danger factors. Fire danger maps were created using several new data-mining algorithms including support vector machine (SVM), generalized linear model (GLM), functional data analysis (FDA), and random forest (RF). All were run in R 3.3.3 software. Finally, the fire danger maps were validated with several indices to determine the model that best predicts the fire danger in Koohdasht County. The results reveal that fire locations were determined mostly by elevation (low), aspect (south and southwest facing slopes), and aridity (semi-arid regions). Most fires occurred in non-natural landscapes: residential areas (46.74% of fires), agricultural lands (25.77%), and gardens (5.42%). In total, 77.93% of fires occurred in non-natural landscapes and within 500 m of roads. Only 22.07% of fires occurred on rangelands and forests. Three factors (distance from roads, climate, and aspect) were the strongest predictors of fire locations in the study area. Furthermore, area-under-the-curve (AUC) values indicate that the FDA (0.777) and GLM (0.772) algorithms generated the most accurate fire danger maps. These results have practical implications for fire danger management in the Zagros forests and provide baseline information for forest managers about the most important factors affecting fire danger in the similar regions. This methodology can be used by forest managers to predict the areas with greatest fire danger to prevent future fires through land use management, planning, and strategic decision-making. The results enable forest managers to find the best methods to monitor, manage, and control fire occurrence based on fire danger maps in the forests of western Iran, or in forests of other regions with similar conditions.",Land cover; Effective factors; Data mining techniques; Fire danger mapping; Boruta algorithm; Sentinel-2A satellite images,"Eskandari, S; Pourghasemi, HR; Tiefenbacher, JP",2020.0,Journal,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118338,"[Eskandari, Saeedeh] Agr Res Educ & Extens Org AREEO, Forest Res Div, Res Inst Forests & Rangelands RIFR, Tehran, Iran; [Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza] Shiraz Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Engn, Shiraz, Iran; [Tiefenbacher, John P.] Texas State Univ, Dept Geog, San Marcos, TX USA",ELSEVIER,English,0378-1127,
WoS,Range detection assessment of photonic radar under adverse weather perceptions,"The photonic radar is attaining its popularity significantly for the last few years due to its potential to offer wide bandwidth to achieve an extended target-range with high range- and image-resolution [8-10]. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art microwave radar is incapable to meet these essential requirements of the self-driving vehicles due to its limited bandwidth. Moreover, to work at higher microwave-frequencies to attain high bandwidth, the microwave radar's performance is affected by atmospheric fluctuations that result in short target-range. So, it becomes imperative to demonstrate and investigate a photonic radar that has the potential to achieve a prolonged target-range in harsh environment perceptions. Subsequently, the authors develop a model of linear frequency-modulated photonic radar to capture the reflected echoes with high power sufficient for target-detection with high accuracy using two simulation software, i.e. Matlab (TM) and Optisys (TM). Further, the demonstrated photonic radar is developed and carried out under the influence of weak-to-strong atmospheric regimes. Our work determines how the weak-to-strong states of atmospheric fluctuations affect the demonstrated photonic radar and which detection strategy, either coherent or non-coherent, should be adopted to attain a prolonged target-range in the presence of harsh weather conditions. The results show better signal-to-noise ratio with high power of reflected echoes to achieve an extended target-range and are aligned in the acceptable ranges.",Photonic radar; Coherent detection; Non-coherent detection; Weather conditions,"Sharma, V; Sergeyev, S",2020.0,Journal,OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS,10.1016/j.optcom.2020.125891,"[Sharma, Vishal; Sergeyev, Sergey] Aston Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Aston Inst Photon Technol AiPT, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Sharma, Vishal; Sergeyev, Sergey] Aston Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Aston Inst Photon Technol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",ELSEVIER,English,0030-4018,

Optimization of the dealumination process is conducted using the help of statistical software 10, where the variables used are acid concentration (5-7 M), temperature of dealumination (55-70 degrees C) and time of dealumination (2-6 h). The acidity characterization test of dealuminated Zeolite Y using ammonia and pyridine solution. Glycerol Monostearate yield was obtained by GC-MS test that was carried out on 2 samples zeolite Y catalyst with the highest value of total and surface acidity of zeolite Y which produced 2.18% and 4% yield of Glycerol Monostearate. The two samples showed that the greater the acidity, the GMS yield was also greater.

WoS,"Quantification of mortality and morbidity attributed to the ambient air criteria pollutants in Shiraz city, Iran","According to the epidemiological surveys, ambient air pollution has directly related to mortality and different diseases such as cardiovascular and respiratory defects. Among the atmospheric contaminants, criteria air ones (NO2, O-3, PM2.5/10, SO2) demonstrated that have particular importance in the community disease. The overall goal of this paper was to study the impact of criteria air contaminants on the health of the inhabitants of Shiraz city, Iran. To accomplish this, the AirQ(2.23) software was applied. The results of the study revealed that the annual average NO2, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, and O-3 concentrations are 39.98, 27.6, 14.35, 46.16, and 120.03 mu g/m(3) in 2016 and 30.27, 23.97, 16.45, 51.65, and 52.58 mu g/m(3) in 2017. The total International Classification of Diseases (ICD), cardiovascular, and respiratory mortalities caused by air contaminants in Shiraz was predicted as 911, 628, and 182 cases in 2016, and 346, 370, and 82 cases in 2017, respectively. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) had the greatest rate of total mortality with the attributable equivalent of 4.3% in 2016, but this value has been decreased to 0.42% in 2017. The findings of this research revealed that air contamination has caused problems in Shiraz city according to the predicted results. The findings of this work provide useful data for regional and national health policymakers, who should take decisions to develop strategies for control air contaminants and estimate the costeffectiveness of interventions.

An operator support tool (OST) using deep learning techniques and trained by data from dynamic probabilistic safety/risk assessment (DPSA/DPRA) is proposed to assist the NPP personnel in decision-making. The DPSA/DPRA methodology employs time-dependent branching conditions based on the evolving state of the NPP and accounts for complex hardware/process/software/human interactions to predict possible outcomes of the initiating event. A large number of scenarios generated from the DPSA/DPRA performed for a pressurized water reactor station blackout as a function of time were used to train the OST to predict possible offsite dose outcomes at 2-mile and 10-mile site boundaries for emergency response planning. The results show that the OST can predict offsite dose levels with greater than 90% accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Though, they are still representing less than 3% of total bioethanol production, the GHG reduction potential is higher than for 1G-bioethanol. The environmental impacts of bioethanol production are totally dependent on feedstock availability and conversion technology. The biochemical conversion route must overcome several technological and economical challenges such as pretreatment, fermentation, hydrolysis process and separation. A completely mature technology is still to be developed and must adapted to the nature of the feedstock. Nevertheless, using process simulation software, Life Cycle Assessment and integrating the different steps of bioresource harvesting and treatment processes, including the energy balances and the water requirements, it is shown that 2G bioethanol production will reduce environmental impacts provided the evaluation addresses a long-time perspective, including all conversion steps and the regeneration of the bioresource.",2G (second generation) bioethanol; Lignocellulosic biomass; Fermentation; Process simulation; Environmental impact,"Sharma, B; Larroche, C; Dussap, CG",2020.0,Review,BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123630,"[Sharma, Bhawna; Larroche, Christian; Dussap, Claude-Gilles] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Inst Pascal, UMR, CNRS,SIGMA Clermont, 4 Ave Blaise Pascal,BP 206, F-63178 Aubiere, France",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0960-8524,
WoS,Can regional aerial images from orthophoto surveys produce high quality photogrammetric Canopy Height Model? A single tree approach in Western Europe,"Forest monitoring tools are needed to promote effective and data driven forest management and forest policies. Remote sensing techniques can increase the speed and the cost-efficiency of the forest monitoring as well as large scale mapping of forest attribute (wall-to-wall approach). Digital Aerial Photogrammetry (DAP) is a common cost-effective alternative to airborne laser scanning (ALS) which can be based on aerial photos routinely acquired for general base maps. DAP based on such pre-existing dataset can be a cost effective source of large scale 3D data. In the context of forest characterization, when a quality Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is available, DAP can produce photogrammetric Canopy Height Model (pCHM) which describes the tree canopy height. While this potential seems pretty obvious, few studies have investigated the quality of regional pCHM based on aerial stereo images acquired by standard official aerial surveys. Our study proposes to evaluate the quality of pCHM individual tree height estimates based on raw images acquired following such protocol using a reference filed-measured tree height database. To further ensure the replicability of the approach, the pCHM tree height estimates benchmarking only relied on public forest inventory (FI) information and the photogrammetric protocol was based on low-cost and widely used photogrammetric software. Moreover, our study investigates the relationship between the pCHM tree height estimates based on the neighboring forest parameter provided by the FI program. Our results highlight the good agreement of tree height estimates provided by pCHM using DAP with both field measured and ALS tree height data. In terms of tree height modeling, our pCHM approach reached similar results than the same modeling strategy applied to ALS tree height estimates. Our study also identified some of the drivers of the pCHM tree height estimate error and found forest parameters like tree size (diameter at breast height) and tree type (evergreenness/deciduousness) as well as the terrain topography (slope) to be of higher importance than image survey parameters like the variation of the overlap or the sunlight condition in our dataset. In combination with the pCHM tree height estimate, the terrain slope, the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and the evergreenness factor were used to fit a multivariate model predicting the field measured tree height. This model presented better performance than the model linking the pCHM estimates to the field tree height estimates in terms of r(2) (0.90 VS 0.87) and root mean square error (RMSE, 1.78 VS 2.01 m). Such aspects are poorly addressed in literature and further research should focus on how pCHM approaches could integrate them to improve forest characterization using DAP and pCHM. Our promising results can be used to encourage the use of regional aerial orthophoto surveys archive to produce large scale quality tree height data at very low additional costs, notably in the context of updating national forest inventory programs.",Photogrammetry; Structure from motion; Tree height; Large frame aerial imagery,"Michez, A; Huylenbroeck, L; Bolyn, C; Latte, N; Bauwens, S; Lejeune, P",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,10.1016/j.jag.2020.102190,"[Michez, Adrien] Univ Rennes 2, LETG, CNRS, UMR 6554, Pl Recteur Henri Le Moal, F-35043 Rennes, France; [Michez, Adrien; Huylenbroeck, Leo; Bolyn, Corentin; Latte, Nicolas; Bauwens, Sebastien; Lejeune, Philippe] Univ Liege ULiege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, TERRA Teaching & Res Ctr Forest Life, 2 Passage Deportes, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium",ELSEVIER,English,1569-8432,
WoS,Omnis Praedictio: Estimating the full spectrum of human performance with stroke gestures,"Designing effective, usable, and widely adoptable stroke gesture commands for graphical user interfaces is a challenging task that traditionally involves multiple iterative rounds of prototyping, implementation, and follow-up user studies and controlled experiments for evaluation, verification, and validation. An alternative approach is to employ theoretical models of human performance, which can deliver practitioners with insightful information right from the earliest stages of user interface design. However, very few aspects of the large spectrum of human performance with stroke gesture input have been investigated and modeled so far, leaving researchers and practitioners of gesture-based user interface design with a very narrow range of predictable measures of human performance, mostly focused on estimating production time, of which extremely few cases delivered accompanying software tools to assist modeling. We address this problem by introducing Omnis Praedictio (OMNISfor short), a generic technique and companion web tool that provides accurate user-independent estimations of any numerical stroke gesture feature, including custom features specified in code. Our experimental results on three public datasets show that our model estimations correlate on average r(s) > 0.9 with groundtruth data.

WoS,A Systematic Review of Search Strategies in Dynamic Symbolic Execution,"One of the major concerns of dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) based automated test case generation is its huge search space which restricts its usage for industrial-size program testing. In fact, DSE performs test case generation by exploring paths of the program, and the number of program paths is exponential in the number of branch conditions encountered during execution. Thus, by increasing the number of branches, the search space will be extremely large and without applying an effective and efficient technique to explore the search space, DSE would fail to achieve the predesignated goals in the given budget. To this end, different search strategies have been proposed to prioritize program paths and to select the most promising ones with respect to the testing goal. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive systematic review of search strategies in DSE. We collect different techniques and methods concerning the topic, classify and summarize them, highlight their advantages and drawbacks, and provide a complete comparison of the methods in each category. The classification is carried out according to the type of search and also the information source exploited by the strategies to direct DSE.

WoS,"Geometric assessment of imaging methods for complete denture form: Comparisons among cone-beam computed tomography, desktop dental scanning, and handheld optical scanning","Purpose: The present study aimed to examine three methods for imaging a complete denture form and to discuss the geometric assessment and availability of these methods. Methods: Three methods were used: cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), desktop dental scanning (DDS), and handheld optical scanning (HOS). Three sides of a cuboid resin block of a known size were measured on the captured images. Ten upper and lower complete dentures were digitized using each of the three methods. The denture forms in the standard triangulated language format were reconstructed using the computer aided design software with three resolutions: 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0. The two images were superimposed through a least-square algorithm, and the mean differences were examined among the three types of imaging methods and resolutions. Results: The smallest mean differences and variations were obtained for CBCT and DDS, followed by HOS in the experiment using resin block. The lengths of longitudinal and horizontal sides were shortened in CBCT and DDS, whereas the height was shortened in HOS. The variations in each direction were very small by repetitive imaging within every imaging method. The difference between the CBCT and DDS was significantly smaller than that in the other two groups in experiment using actual dentures. The influence of resolution was comparatively low. Conclusions: The results suggested that CBCT and DDS had a similar geometric assessment, but that of the HOS was lower. (C) 2020 Japan Prosthodontic Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Digital protocol for creating a virtual gingiva adjacent to teeth with subgingival dental preparations,"Purpose: This article describes a digital technique used to record gingival emergence profiles modeled for the prosthetic restoration of teeth prepared using biologically oriented preparation technique (BOPT). Materials and methods: The description of the technique of intraoral recording, manipulation of digital files, and chairside protocol of prosthetic restorations is developed in the present manuscript on two anterior teeth treated with vertical and subgingival dental preparations for restoration with ceramic crowns. The manipulation of the digital files registered with an intraoral scanner with software that allows its alignment (best-fit) and the performance boolean of operation manages to create a virtual gingival emergency like the one it presents when it is adapted on the cervical part of the interim prosthesis. Conclusions: The technique allows the dentist and laboratory technician to obtain a digital reproduction of the subgingival soft tissues around the prosthetic crown, unaffected by the collapse of the gingival sulcus when the provisional crown is removed, as well as an exact copy of the provisional restoration, making it possible to fabricate a definitive prosthesis that ensures precise anatomy, and so good compatibility with periodontal tissues.

WoS,"ECOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF EXISTING PLANT RESOURCES OF MANRAI HILLS, SWAT, PAKISTAN USING MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS","Like other montane temperate forests in Pakistan, vegetation of Manrai hills, Swat is declining at an alarming rate due to anthropogenic pressure, although they represent abode of plant biodiversity and need special care and attention. Keeping this motive in mind, the area was studied to evaluate the existing vegetation during 2012-2016. Species and environmental data from 50 quadrats by using stratified random sampling viz., 1x1m(2), 2x2m(2) and 10x10m(2) for herbs, shrubs and trees, respectively were placed in TURBOVEG (v. 2.101) software and transferred to JUICE (v. 7.0.102) software for establishing reliable clusters. From the sampled area, a total of 270 species of vascular plants were recorded. Three communities viz., 1) Quercus-Sarcococca-Pinus, 2) Iris-Poa-Arenaria and 3) Abies-Picea-Viburnum were determined through standard default parameters of modified TWINSPAN. All communities showed distinct strata with clear demarcation of tree, shrub and herb layers. On an average, tree, shrub and herb layers were occurred at 13.52 +/- 7.62m, 0.90 +/- 0.39m, 35.0 +/- 7cm, respectively. Average Species richness (21.38 +/- 5.29), Shannon-Wiener (2.56 +/- 0.32), Simpson (0.88 +/- 0.05) and evenness (0.85 +/- 0.06) indices were comparatively higher in comparison to other studies from Pakistan. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) run through PC-ORD (v.6) indicated that topographic, edaphic and anthropogenic factors as the main determinants of community types.

WoS,Groundwater vulnerability assessment in different types of aquifers,"The concept of groundwater vulnerability is used in groundwater management and risk assessment. Among the parameters contributing to groundwater vulnerability are: depth to groundwater; net recharge rate; aquifer media; topography; vadose zone; hydraulic conductivity; aquifer thickness; and, pumping density rate in case of over-pumping. Groundwater is considered an important water resource in Egypt. Hence, this valuable source should be evaluated against its vulnerability to all possible pollution risks. In this research, three areas are selected and representing different aquifer types with different hydrogeological characteristics. The first area is Al-Minia governorate to represent the Nile valley region, which is underlain by the Nile valley aquifer. The second area is Wadi Al-Natrun to represent the Nile Delta fringes region, which is underlain by Moghra aquifer. The last area is El Kharga Oasis to represent Western desert region, which is underlain by Nubian Sandstone aquifer. A groundwater vulnerability maps for the three regions are produced using Microsoft Excel, Golden Software Surfer 12 and the analytical hierarchy process method (AHP) for rating and weighting the contributing eight parameters. The main outcome of this research is the vulnerability classification for each region supported by the corresponding vulnerability map. The study indicated that the highest weight is assigned to the depth to groundwater and soil media parameters while the lowest weight was assigned to the topography factor. The results indicated that, for Al-Minia study area, about 85% of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 11% is low to medium and 4% is medium to high. For Wadi Al-Natrun study area, about 67% of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 3.3% is low to medium and 28.7% is medium to high. For El Kharga Oasis study area, about 48.8% of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 51.5% is low to medium.",Groundwater; Vulnerability; Al-Minia; Wadi Al-natrun; El Kharga oasis,"Abu-Bakr, HA",2020.0,Journal,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106275,"[Abu-Bakr, Heba Abd El-Aziz] Natl Water Res Ctr, Res Inst Groundwater, Cairo, Egypt",ELSEVIER,English,0378-3774,
WoS,Least limiting water and matric potential ranges of agricultural soils with calculated physical restriction thresholds,"The least limiting water range (LLWR) is a modern and widely used soil physical quality indicator based on predefined limits of water availability, aeration, and penetration resistance, providing a range of soil water contents in which their limitations for plant growth are minimized. However, to set up the upper and lower limits for a range of soil physical properties is a challenge for LLWR computation and hence for adequate water management. Moreover, the usual LLWR is given in terms of the soil water content in which only for field capacity and permanent wilting point, the matric potential range is known. In this paper, we present a procedure for calculating LLWR using Genuchten's water retention curve parameters and introducing the least limiting matric potential ranges of agricultural soils, which we named LLMPR, defined as the range of matric potential for which soil aeration, water availability, and mechanical resistance would not be restrictive to plant growth. Additionally, we calculated the minimal air-filled porosity, field capacity, permanent wilting point, and limiting soil penetration resistance thresholds which define the upper and lower limits of LLWR and LLMPR. Finally, we present some application examples using experimental data (from cultivated and forest soils) and developed an algorithm for their calculation in the R software. The calculated soil physical restriction thresholds were sensitive to changes in soil structure and clay content and were changeable rather than fixed. Based on experimental data, our calculations with the calculated parameters showed that an increase in LLWR and its corresponding LLMPR could be achieved with improvements in soil structure. Higher water content at field capacity, as well as a larger soil penetration resistance threshold to a given root elongation rate were observed in the structured in comparison to the cultivated soil. The LLWR and LLMPR as presented in this study was computationally implemented as an R function (R software), named llwr_llmpr, and in an interactive web page, both available in the R package soilphysics, version 4.0 or later, available from https://arsilva87.github.io/soilphysics/ or CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/soilphysics/index.html).",Agricultural water management; Soil physical restrictions; Water availability,"de Lima, RP; Tormena, CA; Figueiredo, GC; da Silva, AR; Rolim, MM",2020.0,Journal,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106299,"[de Lima, Renato P.; Rolim, Mario M.] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Agr Engn, Rua Dom Manoel Medeiros S-N, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Tormena, Cassio A.] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Agron, Av Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Figueiredo, Getulio C.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Soil Sci, Av Bento Goncalves 7712, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [da Silva, Anderson R.] Goiano Fed Inst, Dept Agron, Geraldo Silva Nascimento Rd,Km 2-5, BR-75790000 Urutai, Go, Brazil",ELSEVIER,English,0378-3774,
WoS,BloomStore: Dynamic Bloom-Filter-based Secure Rule-Space Management Scheme in SDN,"Software-defined networking (SDN) provides an efficient way of managing traffic load by shifting complex and rigid computing tasks to the centralized controller. It reduces the burden on the switches, task of which is to perform the routing based upon the rule-action pair. However, the flow table storage capacity of switches is limited. It may have to face performance bottlenecks, which, in turn, can cause serious security breaches and performance degradation. Hence, in this article, BloomStore, which is a dynamic bloom-filter-based secure rule-space management scheme in SDN, is proposed. BloomStore handles the data traffic dynamically by managing network resources. A twofold security check is used for secure data transfer using double hashing, i.e., two independent hash functions are used to generate k hash functions. Moreover, partitioned hashing is proposed to have insertion and query in a bucket of bloom array.

To run the simulations, a six cascade-stages hydrogen AMRL cycle has been proposed. From the first to the last stage, the regenerators are made of the following magnetic materials: Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Tm respectively. The validity of the proposed model has been performed through Cristal2 AMR demonstrator built to operate at room temperature. Good agreements have been found between experimental and numerical results. Then, simulations of the proposed multistage hydrogen AMRL have been carried out for applied magnetic induction up to 7 T. It has been shown that a mass flow rate of 100 mg s(-1) of hydrogen initially at 300 K and 1 atm can be cooled down to 57 K. Thus, the capability of the proposed CFD method for predicting consistent results has been demonstrated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,TuneMPC-A Tool for Economic Tuning of Tracking (N)MPC Problems,"Economic nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is a variant of NMPC that directly optimizes an economic performance index instead of a tracking error. Although economic NMPC can achieve excellent closed-loop performance, the associated computational effort as well as the difficulty of guaranteeing stability in practice are its main drawbacks. Motivated by these difficulties, a formal procedure was developed that tunes a tracking (non)linear MPC scheme so that it is first-order equivalent to economic NMPC. This letter introduces TuneMPC, a new open-source software framework that closes the gap between the underlying theory and practical application of this tuning procedure. For user-provided system dynamics, constraints and economic objective, TuneMPC enables automated computation of optimal steady states and periodic trajectories, and returns the corresponding tuned stage cost matrices. To demonstrate the potential of the tool, we apply the technique to the challenging example of an autonomous tethered aircraft flying periodic orbits for airborne wind energy harvesting.",Economics; Tuning; Stability criteria; Numerical stability; Software; Orbits; Predictive control for nonlinear systems; predictive control for linear systems,"De Schutter, J; Zanon, M; Diehl, M",2020.0,Journal,IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS,10.1109/LCSYS.2020.2996019,"[De Schutter, Jochem; Diehl, Moritz] Univ Freiburg, Dept Microsyst Engn, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Zanon, Mario] IMT Sch Adv Studies Lucca, Dept Dynam Syst Control & Optimizat, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Diehl, Moritz] Univ Freiburg, Dept Math, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,2475-1456,
WoS,Diagnosis of the single leakage in the fluid pipeline through experimental study and CFD simulation,"The pipeline safety management system is crucial to transfer oil and gas because the phenomena of leakage commonly occurs in the long -distant pipelines. Hidden safety hazards can be caused by design and construction defects, affected by natural disasters, or corroded by the transmission fluid. Therefore, quick detection will not only reduce the loss of transported oil and gas but also can protect the local environment. In this study, we develop a new method to detect the pipeline leak by analyzing pressure distribution through the leak. Pipeline leak detection tests are operated using a flow loop. Through the experiments, four parameters which are pres- sures and flow rates of pipeline inlet and outlet are recorded. Then the specific location of the leak is determined by dimensionless analysis of flow parameters. To generate the solution to locate the leak, we introduce three dimensionless variables, which are dimensionless leak location, dimensionless leak rate, and dimensionless pressure drop. Then the relationship of pressure distribution and leak parameters is built through the simulation models. After running 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with commercial software (FLUENT), the pressure distribution in the pipeline with leakage in the experiments will be verified by the experimental data. Finally, the mathematical models are developed to detect and evaluate the leakage through the pipeline. CFD simulation results show that both the leak rate and location have significant effects on the pressure dis- tribution through the pipe, which is identical to the outcome from the experiments. When the dimensionless leak location is smaller or the dimensionless leak rate is larger, the dimensionless pressure drop is smaller. The mathematical model which is based on these dimensionless variables can be applied in locating the leak point in the real accident.",Pipeline leakage; Dimensionless variable analysis; CFD simulation,"Fu, H; Yang, L; Liang, HR; Wang, S; Ling, KG",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107437,"[Fu, Hao; Yang, Lu; Liang, Huirong; Wang, Sai; Ling, Kegang] Univ North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",ELSEVIER,English,0920-4105,
WoS,Characteristics of bubble motion and distribution in a multiphase rotodynamic pump,"The characteristics of bubble motion and distribution in multiphase pumps are complex and have not yet been clearly described. In this study, high-speed photography technology was used to investigate the gas -liquid flow in detail. A numerical model that considers bubble coalescence and breakup was developed based on Euler two - fluid model, and it was embedded in ANSYS-CFX software with secondary development technology. The reli- ability of the developed model was validated by comparison with the efficiency and head of the test pump as well as the distribution and size of bubbles. The experimental results revealed that bubbles in the impeller moved from the blade pressure surface to the blade suction surface along a similar path, and accumulated there. Then, the accumulated bubbles decreased in size as they hit the blade wall. The necessary condition for bubble accumulation at the impeller hub was obtained by numerical analysis. The force acting on the bubble, M 1 , which is caused by the pressure difference from the shroud to hub of the impeller, must be much greater than the sum of the centrifugal force f g and lift force L g ( M 1 ? f g ? L g ). Furthermore, the bubble diameter in the guide vane was significantly greater than that in the impeller due to the strong bubble coalescence. At IGVF s of 3.0%, 9.0%, and 15.0%, the bubble diameters in the guide vane increased by 0.03 mm, 0.21 mm, and 0.24 mm, respectively.",Multiphase rotodynaimc pump; Bubble motion; Gas distribution; Experimental technology; Computational fluid dynamics (CFD),"Zhang, WW; Zhu, BS; Yu, ZY",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107435,"[Zhang, Wenwu; Zhu, Baoshan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Energy & Power Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhiyi] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER,English,0920-4105,

WoS,GPU accelerated study of a dual-frequency driven single bubble in a 6-dimensional parameter space: The active cavitation threshold,"The active cavitation threshold of a dual-frequency driven single spherical gas bubble is studied numerically. This threshold is defined as the minimum intensity required to generate a given relative expansion (R-max - R-E)/R-E, where R-E is the equilibrium size of the bubble and R-max is the maximum bubble radius during its oscillation. The model employed is the Keller-Miksis equation that is a second order ordinary differential equation. The parameter space investigated is composed by the pressure amplitudes, excitation frequencies, phase shift between the two harmonic components and by the equilibrium bubble radius (bubble size). Due to the large 6-dimensional parameter space, the number of the parameter combinations investigated is approximately two billion. Therefore, the high performance of graphics processing units is exploited; our in-house code is written in C+ + and CUDA C software environments. The results show that for (R-max - R-E)/R-E = 2, the best choice of the frequency pairs depends on the bubble size. For small bubbles, below 3 mu m, the best option is to use just a single frequency of a low value in the giant response region. For medium sized bubbles, between 3 mu m and 6 mu m, the optimal choice is the mixture of low frequency (giant response) and main resonance frequency. For large bubbles, above 6 mu m, the main resonance dominates the active cavitation threshold. Increasing the prescribed relative expansion value to (R-max - R-E)/ R-E = 3, the optimal choice is always single frequency driving with the lowest value (20 kHz here). Thus, in this case, the giant response always dominates the active cavitation threshold. The phase shift between the harmonic components of the dual-frequency driving (different frequency values) has no effect on the threshold.",Keller-Miksis equation; Bubble dynamics; Dual-frequency driving; Cavitation threshold; GPU programming,"Hegedus, F; Klapcsik, K; Lauterborn, W; Parlitz, U; Mettin, R",2020.0,Journal,ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY,10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.105067,"[Hegedus, Ferenc; Klapcsik, Kalman] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Hydrodynam Syst, Budapest, Hungary; [Lauterborn, Werner; Mettin, Robert] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Drittes Phys Inst, Gottingen, Germany; [Parlitz, Ulrich] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Max Planck Inst Dynam & Selforg, Res Grp Biomed Phys, Gottingen, Germany; [Parlitz, Ulrich] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Inst Dynam Komplexer Syst, Gottingen, Germany",ELSEVIER,English,1350-4177,
WoS,Virtual and physical prototyping of a beam-based variable stiffness actuator for safe human-machine interaction,"This paper reports about the virtual and physical prototyping of an antagonistic Variable Stiffness Actuator (VSA) to be used on robotic arms specifically realized for physical human-robot interaction. Such antagonistic actuation system, which comprises purposely conceived Compliant Transmission Elements (CTEs) characterized by a nonlinear relation between the deflection and the applied torque, allows to simultaneously control both the joint's position and stiffness. The CTE's beams geometry, namely slender spline beams, has been defined by means of an automatic routine leveraging on Matlab and ANSYS and allowing for the shape optimization of complex flexures. The synthesized springs are characterized by a predefined quadratic torque-deflection characteristic, which is shown to guarantee a precise stiffness modulation while avoiding the need for a joint's position sensor. After shape optimization, the GTE is fabricated via additive manufacturing and subsequently tested. The acquired data show a very good consistency with the numerical results, although highlighting a nonnegligible hysteresis due to material damping. Therefore, in order to cope with such unavoidable effect along with other parameter uncertainties and unmodeled effects (e.g. static friction), a robust feedback controller is proposed, allowing for the simultaneous and decoupled regulation of joint position and stiffness. Finally, a VSA prototype is produced and tested.

WoS,Time-optimal tool motion planning with tool-tip kinematic constraints for robotic machining of sculptured surfaces,"A time-optimal motion planning method for robotic machining of sculptured surfaces is reported in this paper. Compared with the general time-optimal robot motion planning, a surface machining process provides extra constraints such as tool-tip kinematic limits and complexity of the curved tool path that also need to be taken into account. In the proposed method, joint space and tool-tip kinematic constraints are considered. As there are high requirements for tool path following accuracy, an efficient numerical integration method based on the Pontryagin maximum principle is adopted as the solver for the time-optimal tool motion planning problem in robotic machining. Nonetheless, coupled and multi-dimensional constraints make it difficult to solve the problem by numerical integration directly. Therefore, a new method is provided to simplify the constraints in this work. The algorithm is implemented on the ROS (robot operating system) platform. The geometry tool path is generated by the CAM software firstly. And then the whole machine moving process, i.e. the feedrate of machining process, is scheduled by the proposed method. As a case study, a sculptured surface is machined by the developed method with a 6-DOF robot driven by the ROS controller. The experimental results validate the developed algorithm and reveal its advantages over other conventional motion planning algorithms for robotic machining.",Sculptured surface; Robotic machining; Time-optimal path planning; Tool-tip kinematics; Kinematic constraints,"Lu, L; Zhang, J; Fuh, JYH; Han, J; Wang, H",2020.0,Journal,ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING,10.1016/j.rcim.2020.101969,"[Lu, Lei; Han, Jiang] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Mech Engn, 193 Tunxi Rd, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lei; Zhang, Jiong; Fuh, Jerry Ying Hsi; Wang, Hao] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, 9 Engn Dr 1, Singapore 117575, Singapore",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0736-5845,
WoS,Application of chromium oxide-based redox reactions for hydrogen production via solar thermochemical splitting of water,"Thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as efficiency analysis of the Cr2O3/Cr water splitting (Cr-WS) cycle, was conducted in this study. The thermodynamic properties required for the computations were obtained from an HSC Chemistry 9.9 software. An increase in thermal reduction (TR) temperature (T-H) from 1800 K to 2230 K was responsible for the rise in the percentage TR of Cr2O3 (Tr-Cr) from 0% to 100%. The equilibrium analysis additionally indicates that the re-oxidation of Cr into Cr2O3 via WS reaction is feasible at any temperature from 300 to 3000 K (we have selected 1300 K for this study). The efficiency analysis indicates that the (Q) over dot(solar-reactor-Cr-WS) and (Q) over dot(solar-heater-Cr-WS) were enhanced by 3636.8 kW and 260.0 kW due to the increment in the T-H from 1800 K to 2230 K. The increase in the (Q) over dot(solar-reactor-Cr-WS) and (Q) over dot(solar-heater-Cr-WS) resulted into a rise in the (Q) over dot(solar-cycle-Cr-WS) by 3896.8 kW.

WoS,Numerical modelling of a bubbling fluidized bed combustion: A simplified approach,"Biomass combustion in a bubbling fluidized bed has become a competitive technology due to its unique advantages of fuel flexibility and less pollutant emission. Numerical modelling of bubbling fluidized bed is a complex issue and recent models can't describe the fuel movement and conversion due to the complicated combustion phenomena. In this work, a simplified comprehensive three dimensional numerical model is used to study different biomass combustion process in a bubbling fluidized bed combustor including all necessary steps to define solid movement and conversion using CFD software AVL Fire. The hydrodynamic behaviour and combustion of the solid fuel is observed under different working conditions. Two different biomass fuels, wood pellet and olive stone are used to study the combustion phenomena. Solid conversion process is modelled comprehensively including evaporation, devolatilization, homogeneous and heterogeneous char reactions with a detailed heat transfer process. Eulerian-Eulerian approach is used to represent the transport of mass exchange, momentum and energy for solid and gas phases through different user defined subroutines. Various scalers are used to optimize the solid volume fraction, bed temperature distribution, solid velocity, heat transfer coefficients, gas species concentration and reaction rates for the solid phase as well as for the gas phase. Numerical results are compared with the existing results available in the literature and found reasonable agreement. High combustion rate is observed due to vigorous agitation of the solid bed.

WoS,Empirical correlation for spray half cone angle in plain-jet airblast atomizers,"Plain-jet airblast atomizers are widely used in industrial applications. The literature contains numerous papers on Sauter mean diameter, however, there is no estimation method available for spray cone angle, SCA, which derivation is the primary goal of this study. Four distinct, practical model liquids were analyzed: distilled water, diesel oil, light heating oil, and crude rapeseed oil. The atomizing pressure and liquid preheating temperature were varied in the range of 0.3-2.4 bar and 25-85 degrees C, respectively. This latter parameter enabled a wide and continuous liquid kinematic viscosity investigation range of 0.33-44.2 mm(2)/s. The resulting sprays were imaged at various shutter speeds for proper edge detection. An adaptive thresholding algorithm was developed in Matlab software environment to calculate SCA. The methodology is discussed in detail to facilitate the re-implementation of this technique since there is no generally accepted method for SCA measurement. SCA inversely varied with liquid density and followed a power law with the air-to-liquid mass flow ratio; however, the derived expression also performed well by replacing air-to-liquid mass flow ratio by either Mach number or momentum flux ratio. A simple empirical equation was derived, which allows the estimation of SCA of airblast atomization in a wide parameter range within a 3.5% deviation. The measured results were evaluated in the light of highspeed camera images in the vicinity of the nozzle; it was found that increased liquid jet breakup length decreases SCA while intense ligament formation increases it.",Airblast; Rapeseed oil; Spray cone angle; Image processing; Threshold; Atomization,"Urban, A; Katona, B; Maly, M; Jedelsky, J; Jozsa, V",2020.0,Conference,14th International Conference on Energy for a Clean Environment (Clean Air),10.1016/j.fuel.2020.118197,"[Urban, Andras; Katona, Balint; Jozsa, Viktor] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Mech Engn, Dept Energy Engn, Muegyetem Rkp 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary; [Maly, Milan; Jedelsky, Jan] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Tech 2896-2, Brno 61669, Czech Republic",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0016-2361,

The models were implemented in the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a. In the experimental setup, the local liquid velocity and liquid saturation diameter profiles at three different location in the column height were determined using optical fiber probes. These experimentally determined profiles were used to validate the local predictions of the CFD model, which considered the two-phase hydrodynamics and the three-phase interaction forces through interfacial momentum exchange closures. The results show that the CFD model can properly predict the local variation of the liquid velocity at different flow rate conditions, with an average absolute error below 18.6%.

WoS,Energy and memory-aware software pipelining streaming applications on NoC-based MPSoCs,"In this article, we explore the problem of energy-aware scheduling of real-time applications modelled by conditional task graphs on NoC based MPSoC such that the total energy consumption is minimized. We propose a novel energy and memory-aware retiming conditional task graph (EMRCTG) approach that integrates task-level coarse-grained software pipelining with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Our approach not only optimizes energy consumption but ensures that memory capacity constraints are satisfied. EMRCTG has two phases. In the first phase, we map tasks to processors, transform intra-period data dependencies into inter-period and generate a schedule by a Non-Linear Programming (NLP)-based algorithm assuming infinite memory capacity. The NLP-based algorithm assigns a continuous frequency and voltage to each task and each communication and uses a polynomial-time heuristic to transform the continuous frequencies and voltages to discrete frequencies and voltages. We analyse the memory consumption of the generated schedule and initiate schedule repair phase 2 if the memory capacity constraints violate. The schedule repair phase finds a set of nodes such that by reducing their retiming values the memory capacity constraints satisfy. We compare our approach against two existing approaches GeneS and JCCTS. GeneS is a genetic algorithm that first transforms the dependent task set into an independent task set and then collectively performs task mapping, ordering and voltage scaling. JCCTS is a mixed integer linear programming based approach that optimally removes inter-processor communication overhead. Our experimental result show that compared to the approach GeneS our approach can obtain an improvement in range of 1.6 to 18 percent and an average improvement of 11 percent. Compared to the approach JCCTS our approach can achieve an improvement in range of 9 to 42 percent and an average improvement of 26 percent. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Autonomic Feature Selection using Computational Intelligence,"This paper introduces an autonomic method to optimize Feature Selection (FS) in autonomic systems while also presenting a taxonomy of FS techniques. Feature selection is a dimension reduction technique that has been proven to lead to improved performance by avoiding overfitting and to address complexity, thus providing faster and cost-effective algorithms. To be successful, the current FS methods are heavily reliant on two key elements: (1) a well defined and static learning objective, and (2) a relevant dataset. Current FS approaches involve mostly a manual process and do not take into account the constant change in the state of the underlying system. However, the method to automate the FS process presented in this paper, the Autonomic Feature Selection (AFS), uses representation and transfer learning concepts borrowed from the deep learning area. Representations of various types of monitoring data from a system are learned, and the resulting knowledge is transferred and re-used. The AFS is targeted to self-aware software systems, where the learning objective and (or) the availability of the relevant data are subject to change. The results suggest that although building and transferring learned representations is computationally expensive, its benefits outweigh the cost, by offering the potential to build flexible and re-usable knowledge structures.

WoS,FTLink: Efficient and flexible link fault tolerance scheme for data plane in Software-Defined Networking,"Link fault tolerance has been a hotspot in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for many years. Both proactive and reactive schemes are proposed to guarantee network availability and robustness. However, the former wastes plenty of Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) and bandwidth resources, while the latter faces long fault recovery time. In this paper, we propose FTLink, an efficient and flexible link fault tolerance scheme in SDN. Firstly, through collecting the current network state information, we pre-generate a set of backup links for each link of the primary path of the flow. We formulate the backup links planning as a multi-objective optimization problem that minimizes the required switch TCAMs and link bandwidths. Combining flow characteristics, we develop a two-step heuristic algorithm, namely planning backup links for each link that transmits elephant flows with the greedy tracing method in step 1 and for each link that transmits mice flows with the bidirectional searching method in step 2, to determine the backup links set. Then, we introduce a global matching table in the controller to maintain the generated backup links and additional flow rules. Once monitoring a faulty link, FTLink looks up the matching table entries and enables the backup links via installing the additional flow rules into the switches to realize flexible fault recovery. Simulations show that FTLink is effective in terms of high-efficiency TCAM and bandwidth usage and produces an acceptable recovery time of less than 30 ms, compared with baseline schemes. The prototype tests under realistic network further confirm the efficiency of FTLink. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We developed a flexible software tool that gathers data from organizations in an automatic way - through adapted connectors - and generates abundant results on the measurement and distribution of employees' performances. The main challenges of human resource departments - quantification of human resource performance, analysis of the distribution of performance, and early identification of employees willing to leave the workforce - are handled through the proposed IT platform. Insights are presented on different granularity levels, from organization view down to department, group, and team. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,"Smart-troubleshooting connected devices: Concept, challenges and opportunities","Today's digital world and evolving technology has improved the quality of our lives but it has also come with a number of new threats. In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyber-physical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of smart-troubleshooting that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault-causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.

WoS,Towards sFlow and adaptive polling sampling for deep learning based DDoS detection in SDN,"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most rampant attacks in the modern Internet of Things (IoT) network infrastructures. Security plays a very vital role for an ever-growing heterogeneous network of IoT nodes, which are directly connected to each other. Due to the preliminary stage of Software Defined Networking (SDN), in the IoT network, sampling based measurement approaches currently results in low-accuracy, higher memory consumption, higher-overhead in processing and network, and low attack-detection. To deal with these aforementioned issues, this paper proposes sFlow and adaptive polling based sampling with Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and deep learning based model, which helps to lower down the various types of prevalent DDoS attacks inside the IoT network. The flexible decoupling property of SDN enables us to program network devices for required parameters without utilizing third-party propriety based hardware or software. Firstly, in data-plane, to lower down processing and network overhead of switches, we deployed sFlow and adaptive polling based sampling individually. Secondly, in control-plane, to optimize detection accuracy, we deployed Snort IDS collaboratively with Stacked Autoencoders (SAE) deep learning model. Furthermore, after applying performance metrics on collected traffic streams, we quantitatively investigate trade off among attack detection accuracy and resources overhead. The evaluation of the proposed system demonstrates higher detection accuracy with 95% of True Positive rate with less than 4% of False Positive rate within sFlow based implementation compared to adaptive polling.

WoS,Predicting the stock price of frontier markets using machine learning and modified Black-Scholes Option pricing model,"The Black-Scholes Option pricing model (BSOPM) has long been in use for valuation of equity options to find the price of stocks. In this work, using BSOPM, we have come up with a comparative analytical approach and numerical technique to find the price of call option and put option and considered these two prices as buying price and selling price of stocks in the frontier markets so that we can predict the stock price (close price). Changes have been made in the model to find the parameters such as 'strike price' and the 'time of expiration' for calculating stock price of frontier markets. To verify the result obtained using modified BSOPM, we have used machine learning approach using the software Rapidminer, where we have adopted different algorithms like the decision tree, ensemble learning method and neural network. It has been observed that, the prediction of close price using machine learning is very similar to the one obtained using BSOPM. Machine learning approach stands out to be a better predictor over BSOPM, because Black-Scholes-Merton equation includes risk and dividend parameter, which changes continuously. We have also numerically calculated volatility. As the price of the stocks goes up due to overpricing, volatility increases at a tremendous rate and when volatility becomes very high; market tends to fall, which can be observed and determined using our modified BSOPM. The proposed modified BSOPM has also been explained based on the analogy of Schrodinger equation (and heat equation) of quantum physics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Novel plenum window with sonic crystals for indoor noise control,"A novel plenum window with incorporation of sonic crystals (SCs) was investigated using numerical and experimental methods in the present studies. Additional insertion loss (IL) that could be obtained by the 3 SCs was computed through a commercial software and was validated through experimental results from reverberation rooms. Experimental data showed that the SCs could attenuate more traffic and construction noises compared to white noise. When the noise source directly faced the opening of the plenum window, the performances of the SCs in reduced traffic and construction noises were improved significantly especially at low and middle frequency ranges (from 250 Hz to 1250 Hz and from 800 Hz to 2500 Hz for traffic and construction noise, respectively), which covered the designed center and resonant frequencies of the SCs (1000 Hz and 1164 Hz, respectively). For such a case, the SCs were able to attenuate additional 4.2 dBA and 2.1 dBA of traffic and construction noises, respectively, at 1000 Hz. Peak IL was found to be at 630 Hz which was about 5.4 dBA and 5.5 dBA for traffic and construction noise, respectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Electromagnetic design method for a TLSRG with application in ocean wave energy conversion,"The tubular linear switched reluctance machine (TLSRM) has shown potential for applications as generator in direct drive conversion of ocean wave energy devices. However, the design of this type of machine is a difficult task and there is no methodology to provide an explicit solution. This work aims to contribute for the solution of this problem with the proposal of a new procedure to design tubular linear switched reluctance generators (TLSRG). With the proposed procedure the TLSRG can be designed to develop a given linear force and to achieve better generation efficiency. The design is defined as a minimization problem where an optimization process is used to find the optimal solution for the dimensional parameters. Finite element method (FEM) analysis is applied to compute the relevant electromagnetic characteristics. The mathematical model of the generator conversion system is formulated to evaluate its dynamic performance. An H-Bridge asymmetric converter is adopted to control the energy flow in the generator. The electric currents in the generator phases are adjusted with a hysteresis controller. A TLSRG with a maximum mean force of 120 kN is designed by applying the proposed procedure, implemented in Matlab (R) and combined with MagNet (R) (FEM commercial software) to compute the electromagnetic characteristics of the machine. The system mathematical model is solved in Simulink (R). The dynamic simulations are performed for a constant velocity of 1.3 m/s. For these operating conditions, the generator is characterised with an output power of 126.2 kW and an efficiency of 82.1%. The control proposed to drive the TLSRG is experimentally tested on a small-scale prototype. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the controller in keeping the phase current near the reference value.",Tubular linear generator; Switched reluctance machine; Ocean wave energy; Direct drive conversion,"Mendes, RPG; Calado, MRA; Mariano, SJPS",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS,10.1016/j.ijepes.2020.106097,"[Mariano, S.

WoS,Partial discharges and noise classification under HVDC using unsupervised and semi-supervised learning,"This paper tackles the problem of the classification of partial discharge (PD) and noise signals by applying unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods. The first step in the proposed methodology is to prepare a set of classification features from the statistical moments of the distribution of the Wavelet detail coefficients extracted from a dataset of signals acquired from a test cell under 40 kVDC. In a second step, an unsupervised learning framework that implements the k-means algorithm is applied to reduce the dimensionality of this initial feature set. The Silhouette index is used to evaluate the number of natural clusters in the dataset while the Dunn index is used to determine which subset of features produces the best clustering quality. Since the unsupervised learning does not provide any method for result validation, then the third step in the methodology of this paper consists of applying a semi-supervised learning framework that implements Transductive Support-Vector Machines. The labeling of the test set that is required in this framework for the result validation is carried out by visual checking of the signal waveforms assisted by GUI tools such as the software PDflex. The results using this methodology showed a high classification accuracy and proved that both learning frameworks can be combined to optimize the selection of classification features.",Semi-supervised learning; Transductive SVMs; K-means; Dunn index; Partial discharges; HVDC,"Morette, N; Heredia, LCC; Ditchi, T; Mor, AR; Oussar, Y",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS,10.1016/j.ijepes.2020.106129,"[Morette, N.; Ditchi, Thierry; Oussar, Y.] Sorbonne Univ, PSL Res Univ, LPEM, ESPCI Paris,CNRS, Paris, France; [Heredia, L.

WoS,Implementation of a D-STATCOM control strategy based on direct power control method for grid connected wind turbine,"Distributed generation (DG) is getting increasing relevancy on the electric energy production. In Tunisia, the increase of the installed wind power has an impact on the grid transmission due to the intermittence of production. Grid operators have now enough field experience to adapt the existing grid codes to the new energy mix. DG systems have proved that they can contribute to grid stability using power converters and control algorithms. Therefore, the installation of the FACT devices is necessary to guarantee the high energy quality and electrical grid stability. STATCOMs present the FACTs which are currently used. This paper presents the main effects of the DG connection to a grid and the role of STATCOM to reduce undesirable effects, making the DG fully operable. Thus, a STATCOM control strategy based on DPC is proposed to show the impact of this device on the quality of electrical power system. The advantage of the proposed technique is to enhance the voltage profile in steady state operation and under different working conditions and sags voltage. Moreover, STATCOM improves the transient voltage stability and therefore helps the wind turbine generator system to remain in service during grid faults. The proficiency and functionality of the proposed controller are demonstrated through detailed theoretical analysis. Computer simulation using the Matlab/Simulink software is performed. Accordingly, a hardware prototype employing a dSpace 1104 board -based system is built for final verification test.

Generally, it has two issues which required to be addressed: (1) the travelling wave (TW) fault location algorithm suitable for the multi-terminal transmission system; and (2) the method of acquiring or processing the TW signal. In this paper, a novel TW fault location algorithm suitable for the LCC-MMC-HVDC hybrid transmission system is researched based on the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Firstly, the TW propagation process characteristic of hybrid LCC-MMC-MTDC transmission system is studied. Secondly, a novel TW fault location algorithm based on HHT is proposed. Eventually, a typical +/- 400 kV LCC-MMC-MTDC hybrid transmission system is established via PSCAD/EMTDC software for the case study to investigate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

WoS,Investigation on the effects of damping over the temperature distribution on internal turning bar using Infrared fusion thermal imager analysis via SmartView software,"In the various machining process, instability of the tool occurs due to chatter vibration. In all metal cutting processes, vibration is induced due to the instability of the cutting tool. The instability problem of the metal cutting process induces undesirable tool vibration and declination in tool life due to augmented cutting temperature. This investigation mainly focuses on fabricated the double impact dampers in the boring tool holder and raise the tool life by reducing the tool temperature. The cutting tool temperature can be effectively decreased by providing impact dampers. The association between boring tool temperature and tool wear during machining was inferred by using Infrared (IR) fusion thermal imager by sensing the infrared rays from the hot surface of the machining tool (insert). The thermal images obtained during the cutting operation were analyzed using smartview3.4 software. It is an obvious fact that increases in tool temperature deteriorate the tool wear during machining. According to the result of the thermal images, it can be concluded the dampers employed is control the tool vibration and also decreased the tool temperature during machining thereby enhancing the tool life. The temperature was found the 170.2 degrees F and 117.6 degrees F for the tools without and with dampers respectively while machining at optimal cutting conditions.

WoS,Optimization of ultrafiltration of whey using Taguchi method for maximizing recovery of lactose,"The current work focuses on establishing optimized conditions for operating parameters of ultrafiltration such as whey source, transmembrane Pressure (TMP), retentate to permeate ratio, membrane type, molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) and temperature so as to maximize lactose recovery. Orthogonal L-16 array created by Taguchi method using MINITAB 19 software was used for obtaining a compact experimental design to analyse the effect of all the operating parameters and their levels on the associated important responses as permeate recovery, permeate flux, fouling and recovery of lactose after crystallization. Whey source was found to be most imperative parameter for reduction in fouling and for maximizing the lactose recovery after crystallization. The dominant effect of whey source was attributed to the variation in pH of whey with different sources. The permeate recovery and permeate flux were found to be highly dependent on the TMP and membrane type respectively with considerable desirability for membrane MWCO as well. For permeate recovery, use of acid whey at 1.5 bar with 1:3 as the retentate to permeate ratio, hydrosart membrane of 10 kDa cut off and temperature of 30 degrees C were found to be the optimum conditions which was also the case for permeate flux except with different value of the optimum ratio as 1:1. The response of fouling showed slight deviation in optimum levels which was also observed for lactose recovery after crystallization.

Most models consider the concrete as a homogeneous material, whereas it is a heterogeneous composite consisting of aggregates, cement paste, and air voids. In addition, the existing heterogeneous models are limited to just one type of aggregate. In this study, two different types of aggregates were selected for concrete mix design and accordingly defined as separate phases in FE models. Two groups of concrete specimens with different water-to-cement ratios were cast. The images were taken using a medical CT scan device and converted to the manageable mesoscale hexahedron elements through the image processing accompanied with meshing technique. FE models were then built considering the mechanical properties of the individual components of concrete determined in the laboratory. Using the explicit dynamics solver of Abaqus software, compressive strength of the specimens was obtained. The compressive strengths of the three specimens with different shapes selected from the two groups of concrete (cubic group I, cubic group II, and cylindrical group II) were estimated with 8.8%, 9.7% and 8% deviations from the experimental curves. The accuracy and performance of this method makes it a potential candidate as a quality control tool for concrete structures. The findings revealed that X-ray CT (XCT) images can be utilized as a suitable method to estimate the ultimate strength of concrete based on early-aged specimens. This can greatly be of advantage to the supervisory administration. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Experimental and numerical studies on ultimate strength behaviour of SCS sandwich beams with UHPFRC,"This paper firstly developed steel-UHPFRC-steel sandwich composite beams (SUSSCBs). Four-point bending tests were then performed on 11 SUSSCBs to evaluate their ultimate strength behaviours. The investigated key parameters included strength of UHPFRC, faceplate thickness, spacing of studs, and shear span ratio. Test results revealed that all 11 SUSSCBs failed in flexure mode even for SUSSCBs with short shear span ratio of 2.4-3.3 due to the high transverse shear resistance and faceplate-concrete bonding provided by the UHPFRC. The faceplate thickness exhibited significant influences on ultimate strength behaviour of SUSSCBs. Meanwhile, strength of UHPFRC, spacing of studs, and shear span ratio exhibited limited influences on failure modes and ultimate strength behaviours of SUSSCBs. Detailed finite element models were then established using general software package ABAQUS. The developed numerical models offered detailed simulation on geometric and material nonlinearities, connectors, and interactions among different interacting components in SUSSCBs. Validations against reported test results proved the capabilities of developed numerical models on simulations of ultimate strength behaviours of SUSSCBs. These test and numerical studies provided comprehensive understanding on ultimate strength behaviour of SUSSCBs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Finally, seven different ages between 0 and 15 years were well discriminated by PLSR. Total 104 feature groups were isolated from all optimized candidate peaks, and 94 VOCs (including unknowns) were preliminarily identified as aging markers. Therein, alcohols, sulfides, phenols and their derivatives, small esters and acids exhibited significantly better discrimination of short-aged rice wines. Correspondingly, furans, aromatics, aldehydes, ketones, most esters and acids, discriminated the long-aged samples better. Meanwhile, the potential origins of certain VOCs were also proposed for further research.

Electrical heating is used in the model to simulate the plasma channel formation by defining the boundary and time-controlled current density initial conditions. Time-dependent physical properties at plasma temperature were used to reflect the actual processing environment. The heat was transferred from the plasma channel to the workpiece by electrical heating from the electrode, and V(v)was calculated by means of the amount of heat transfer.

WoS,Transport properties of RuV-based half-Heusler semiconductors for thermoelectric applications: a computational study,"A systematic study of electronic structure, mechanical and transport properties of RuV-based half-Heusler alloys (RuVZ, Z = As, P, Sb) have been presented usingab initiodensity functional and Boltzmann transport theory. The electronic structures are obtained using generalized gradient approximation with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. All the compounds are crystallized in face centered cubic phase with space group #216. Our preliminary electronic structure simulations reveal that all the alloys are non-magnetic semiconductors. Additionally, the phonon dispersion and elastic constants (along with the related elastic moduli) also verify mechanical stability of the alloys. Due to strong dependence on the electronic bandgap in thermoelectric materials, we have estimated bandgap using more accurate hybrid functional i.e. Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof. The transport coefficients (e.g. Seebeck, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity due to electrons) are calculated by solving the Boltzmann transport equation for charge carriers as implemented in BoltzTraP software under constant relaxation time approximation. The lattice thermal conductivity due to phonons is calculated using more reliable shengBTE code based upon the Boltzmann transport equation for phonons. We have calculated the more reliable value of the thermoelectric figure of merit,ZT(related to the conversion efficiency) for all the compounds. The obtainedZTfor RuVAs, RuVP and RuVSb is 0.41(0.32), 0.21(0.16) and 0.70(0.61) for p(n)-type behavior at 900 K. The corresponding carrier concentrations are also predicted. High value ofZTis obtained for RuVSb alloy due to low lattice thermal conductivity. Among these compounds, RuVSb emerged out as a most suitable candidate for thermoelectric power generation device.

WoS,Ultrasound in labor: impact of a theoretical and practical course on caregiver's perspective and accuracy,"Objective:The aim of the present study was two-fold; first is to assess the impact of a theoretical and practical course on the caregiver's perspective on the use of ultrasound in labor. Second is to evaluate the impact of the course on the measurement of the angle of progression. Materials and methods:Obstetricians participating in the course responded twice to a questionnaire addressing the caregiver's perspective on the use of ultrasound in labor, before and at the end of the course. In addition, all participants measured the angle of progression on a digital simulation software once following the theoretical part and a second time after the conclusion of both the theoretical and practical sessions. All answers to the questionnaire were compared before versus after the course. The angle of progression assessments after the theoretical part and those after the course were compared with those performed by an expert operator. Results:Overall, data from 51 participants were analyzed. In comparison with the pre-course questionnaire, more participants after the course believed ultrasound can be a useful instrument for fetal occiput presentation diagnosis (45; 88.2% versus 26; 51%,p < .001) and for fetal head progression evaluation (37; 72.5% versus 19; 37.3%;p < .001). Although before the course, most participants (32; 62.7%) thought that the transperineal parameters were too complex to be applied, only 19 (37.3%) still considered the complexity of the ultrasound indices, an obstacle against their application in clinical practice after the course (p = .002). Regarding the angle of progression, precourse measurements showed a systematic overestimation in comparison with the gold standard. Furthermore, the coefficient of variation, more than halved following the practical simulation reflecting at least a doubling of the angle of progression (AoP) measurement precision (14.2 versus 5.5%). Conclusions:A theoretical and practical course conducted by expert operators may positively change obstetricians' perspective on the use of ultrasound in labor. Moreover, a practical session seems to improve the participants' accuracy and precision in the assessment of fetal head descent by transperineal ultrasound.",Angle of progression; caregiver's perspective; intrapartum ultrasound; labor,"Youssef, A; Kamel, R",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE,10.1080/14767058.2019.1570113,"[Youssef, Aly] Univ Bologna, St Orsola Malpighi Univ Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Via Massarenti 13, Bologna, Italy; [Kamel, Rasha] Cairo Univ, Kasr Al Ainy Univ Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Cairo, Egypt",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,English,1476-7058,
WoS,Advanced maternal age and perinatal outcome in twin pregnancies: a meta-analysis,"Objective:The current meta-analysis evaluates the perinatal outcomes of twin pregnancies in pregnant women 35 years or older (advanced maternal age) compared with less than 35 years at the time of delivery. Study design:A search was conducted up to March 2018. Electronic databases that were used in our research included; Embase (NO Medline), Ovid Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were twin pregnancies; a comparison between pregnant women aged >= 35 years versus <35 years at the time of delivery and reported perinatal outcomes. Review articles, case reports, and case series were excluded. Data analysis was performed using the Cochrane's Review Manager 5.3 software. Pooled odds ratio for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference for continuous outcomes were calculated using a random effects model.I(2)test was performed to assess heterogeneity. The quality of each accepted article was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results:Our search yielded 1622 publications, of which 25 were assessed for eligibility. A total of 13 studies met our final inclusion criteria. In twin pregnancies, advanced maternal age was associated with a lower incidence of preterm birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation (OR 0.89 [95% CI 0.83-0.95]) compared with women under 35 years at the time of delivery. Gestational diabetes (OR 1.57 [95% CI 1.24-1.98]) and cesarean deliveries (OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.52-1.87]) were significantly higher among women in the advanced maternal age group. All other measured outcomes, such as preterm delivery before 32 weeks' gestation, hypertension disorders, small for gestational age, birth weight under 2500 or 1500 g, need for neonatal intensive care admission and perinatal death were comparable between the groups. Conclusions:This meta-analysis implies that advanced maternal age mothers in the setting of twin pregnancy is associated with comparable outcomes to nonadvanced maternal age mothers.

WoS,From lab to field: Open tools facilitating the translation of maize root traits,"Variation of root traits is associated with soil resource acquisition under abiotic stresses. However, plant breeding programs targeting beneficial root traits are hampered by lacking appropriate phenotyping tools. The availability of high-throughput root phenotyping technologies for seedlings as well as for mature plants grown in the field enabled us to investigate trait translation from the lab to the field. Here we used the established phenotyping techniques Rhizoslides, Shovelomics, and the image-based root phenotyping software, Digital Imaging of Root Traits (DIRT) to phenotype root traits of thirty seedlings and mature maize donor lines from the Drought Tolerance Maize for Africa (DTMA) project. The experiments were carried out in a controlled-environment and a field trial under well-watered and drought conditions. We found significant correlation between seedlings seminal and crown root number in the field (r = 0.68). Primary root branching of seedlings was negatively correlated with crown root branching of field-grown plants (r = -0.54). Our study showed indirect translation of traits between primary root length (r = 0.29) and primary root branching (r = 0.20) with plant performance in the field under drought. Our results suggest that root traits of maize seedlings are predictive for mature maize root traits and plant performance in the field. Our findings suggest that using open tools for high-throughput root phenotyping to screen in maize seedling could be beneficial for breeding programs and paves a cost-efficient way for plant improvement and breeding programs in developing countries.",DIRT; Maize root traits; Rhizoslide; RootNav; Shovelomics; Trait translation,"Salungyu, J; Thaitad, S; Bucksch, A; Kengkanna, J; Saengwilai, PJ",2020.0,Journal,FIELD CROPS RESEARCH,10.1016/j.fcr.2020.107872,"[Salungyu, Jirawat; Kengkanna, Jitrana; Saengwilai, Patompong Johns] Mahidol Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Rama 6 Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Saengwilai, Patompong Johns] Mahidol Univ, Ctr Excellence Environm Hlth & Toxicol EHT, Fac Sci, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Thaitad, Suriphat] Nakhon Sawan Field Crops Res Ctr, Takfa 60190, Nakhon Sawan, Thailand; [Bucksch, Alexander] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bucksch, Alexander] Univ Georgia, Inst Bioinformat, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bucksch, Alexander] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA",ELSEVIER,English,0378-4290,
WoS,Modeling seasonal water yield for landscape management: Applications in Peru and Myanmar,"A common objective of watershed management programs is to secure water supply, especially during the dry season. To develop such programs in contexts of low data and resource availability, program managers need tools to understand the effect of landscape management on the seasonal water balance. However, the performance of simple, parsimonious models is poorly understood. Here, we examine the behavior of a geospatial tool, developed to map monthly water budgets and baseflow contributions and forming part of the InVEST (integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs) software suite. The model uses monthly climate, topography, and land-use data to compute spatial indices of groundwater recharge, baseflow, and quickflow. We illustrate the model application in two large basins in Peru and Myanmar, where we compare results with observed data and alternative hydrologic models. We show that the spatial distribution of baseflow contributions correlated well with an established model in the Peruvian basin (r(2) = 0.81 at the parcel scale). In Myanmar, the model shows an overall satisfactory performance for representing month to month variation (Nash-Sutcliffe-Efficiency 0.6-0.8); however, errors are scale dependent highlighting limitations in representing processes in large basins. Our study highlights modeling challenges, in particular trade-offs between model complexity and accuracy, and illustrates the role that parsimonious models can play to support watershed management programs.",GIS; Baseflow; Watershed management; InVEST; SWAT,"Hamel, P; Valencia, J; Schmitt, R; Shrestha, M; Piman, T; Sharp, RP; Francesconi, W; Guswa, AJ",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110792,"[Hamel, Perrine; Schmitt, Rafael; Sharp, Richard P.] Stanford Univ, Nat Capital Project, Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Valencia, Jefferson] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira ZC 763537 AA, Cali 6713, Colombia; [Shrestha, Manish; Piman, Thanapon] Stockholm Environm Inst SEI, Asia Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Francesconi, Wendy] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Av La Molina, Lima 1895, Peru; [Guswa, Andrew J.] Smith Coll, Picker Engn Program, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Hamel, Perrine] Nanyang Technol Univ, Asian Sch Environm, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0301-4797,

WoS,On the progressive fatigue failure of mechanical composite joints: Numerical simulation and experimental validation,"In this study, a novel holistic progressive damage model for mechanical fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) joints under static and fatigue loading is presented. The model is implemented as a user-defined subroutine in the finite element software ABAQUS/Implicit. First, the theoretical basis of both the static and the fatigue damage model are explained in detail. Here, special emphasis is put on the introduction of the FRP fatigue damage model (FDM), which is based on a physically-motivated hypothesis enabling the consistent coupling of static and fatigue damage properties. Furthermore, detailed insights concerning the experimental calibration of the FDM are presented for the first-time. Subsequently, the presented damage model is validated using first-hand experimental results for standard bolt bearing, as well as T-bolt bearing, test setups. The experimental bearing setups are tested and analyzed until ultimate failure, applying static and fatigue loading. It is shown that the model prognoses are in close accordance with experimental measurements and observations in terms of static joint strength, cyclic stiffness degradation and cycles to failure. The rich information provided by the damage model concerning the progressive damage evolution under static and fatigue loading conditions allows for its application within virtual test rigs for mechanical FRP joints.

WoS,Pre-feasibility analysis of the production of mucic acid from orange peel waste under the biorefinery concept,"The orange peel waste is essentially an important residue in many countries, representing more a problem than one opportunity. Most of this residue processing is related to low added value products and it includes the generation of other residues. Among new alternatives to valorize this residue during last years a high added value product is the mucic acid. This work addresses the pre-feasibility analysis of the mucic acid production using galacturonic acid from pectin using Orange Peel Waste (OPW) as feedstock through the biorefinery concept. The proposed biorefinery comprises the pectin extraction using citric acid, mucic acid production from the liquid fraction of the pectin hydrolysis, and biogas production using the remaining solid. The experiments for pectin extraction and biogas production were carried out to determine the yields to be used in the process simulation. The material and energy balances of the biorefinery were obtained through the Aspen Plus V9.0 tool. These results were used in the energy, economic, and environmental evaluation. A preliminary environmental evaluation for the process was done with Waste Reduction Algorithm (WAR) software. The experimental pectin hydrolysis and biogas production yields were 0.15 +/- 0.77 g/g of OPW, and 0.256 Nm(3)/kg of OPW, respectively. The technical assessment of the biorefinery shows a good performance. Besides, the economic analysis of the proposed biorefinery exhibited feasibility at a processing scale of 140 kg/h. An economic sensitivity analysis was done varying the raw materials costs. From this, the low influence of the raw materials costs in the economic feasibility of the process was elucidated at different scales.

The first principle model for this process was constructed by deriving mass and energy balances equations. Experiments were conducted to determine the kinetic parameters for the esterification of citronellyl laurate and the results were validated using the experimental data. An ordered bi-bi kinetic model was developed by taking into account the inhibition effects of lauric acid as well as the effect of temperature. Moreover, an additional kinetic constant due to the presence of water as a by-product in the reaction system was also verified. Based on the first principle model developed, the parameters of the esterification reaction kinetics were determined using non-linear regression analysis in the MATLAB software. The kinetic model was validated by comparing the profiles between the simulated and the experimental studies in different operating conditions of the reaction. Subsequently, the validated kinetic model was implemented in the first principle model, and simulation studies were conducted using the MATLAB (R) software.

WoS,Wetland extent tools for SDG 6.6.1 reporting from the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS),"Wetlands are the most fragile and threatened ecosystems worldwide, and also one of the most rapidly declining. At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration. Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access. The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users. The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities. The four main components of the SWOS approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the GEO Wetlands Community Portal. Wetland managers and data analysists from more than fifty wetland sites and river basins across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa investigated the benefits and limitations of this EO-based wetland mapping and monitoring approach. We describe research that applies the SWOS tools to test their potential for the mapping of wetlands in a case study based in Albania, and show its effectiveness to derive metrics relevant to the monitoring of SDG indicator 6.6.1.",Wetland decline; Wetland management and monitoring; SDG reporting; Ramsar reporting; Sentinel; Copernicus,"Weise, K; Hofer, R; Franke, J; Guelmami, A; Simonson, W; Muro, J; O'Connor, B; Strauch, A; Flink, S; Eberle, J; Mino, E; Thulin, S; Philipson, P; van Valkengoed, E; Truckenbrodt, J; Zanderg, F; Sanchez, A; Schroder, C; Thonfeld, F; Fitoka, E; Scott, E; Ling, M; Schwarz, M; Kunz, I; Thumer, G; Plasmeijer, A; Hilarides, L",2020.0,Review,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,10.1016/j.rse.2020.111892,"[Weise, Kathrin; Hoefer, Rene; Schwarz, Michael; Kunz, Ina; Thuemer, Grit] Jena Optron GmbH, Otto Eppenstein Str 3, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Franke, Jonas] RSS Remote Sensing Solut GmbH, Dingolfinger Str 9, D-81673 Munich, Germany; [Guelmami, Anis] Res Inst Conservat Mediterranean Wetlands Tour Va, F-13200 Arles, France; [Simonson, Will; O'Connor, Brian; Scott, Emma; Ling, Matthew] World Conservat Monitoring Ctr, Environm Programme, 219 Huntingdon Rd, Cambridge CB3 0DL, England; [Muro, Javier; Strauch, Adrian] Univ Bonn, Ctr Remote Sensing Land Surfaces ZFL, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Flink, Stephan; Hilarides, Lammert] Wetlands Int, POB 471, NL-6700 AL Wageningen, Netherlands; [Eberle, Jonas; Truckenbrodt, John; Zanderg, Franziska] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Remote Sensing Sect, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Mino, Eric] UT SEMIDE EMWIS TU, BP23, F-06901 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Thulin, Susanne; Philipson, Petra] Brockmann Geomat Sweden AB, Torshamnsgatan 39, SE-16440 Kista, Sweden; [van Valkengoed, Eric] TerraSphere Imaging & GIS BV, Keizersgracht 125-127, NL-1015 CJ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Sanchez, Antonio; Schroeder, Christoph] ETC UMA, Edificio Invest Ada Byron C Arquitecto Francisco, Malaga 29010, Spain; [Thonfeld, Frank] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr DFD, Munchener Str 20, D-82234 Wessling, Germany; [Thonfeld, Frank] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Remote Sensing, Oswald Kulpe Str 86, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany; [Fitoka, Eleni] Greek Biotope Wetland Ctr EKBY, 14th Km Thessaloniki Mihaniona,POB 60394, Thermi 57001, Greece; [Plasmeijer, Anouska] IUCN European Reg Off, Blvd Louis Schmidt 64, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium",ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,English,0034-4257,
WoS,Composite dowels as load introduction devices in concrete-filled steel tubular columns,"The application of composite dowel shear connectors extended to endplate joints for beams and concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns is an innovative construction method that provides an effective load introduction between structural elements. These connectors are designed by performing cutouts in laminated steel plates and this open shaped geometry may ensure that transverse reinforcement rebars are disposed at the shear connection region. In this paper an experimental and numerical study was carried out in order to assess the behavior and the resistance of composite dowel connectors applied in CFST columns with compact sections. For the experimental campaign, push tests were carried out with the load applied on the steel tube, and only the concrete core was supported. Finite element (FE) models were simulated using the software ABAQUS and calibrated against the obtained experimental data. Then, a parametric study was carried out where 161 cases were processed. Finally, a design model was proposed to estimate the ultimate strength which had a good correlation with the studied cases.",Composite construction; Composite dowel shear connectors; Concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST); Push tests; Numerical analysis,"Cardoso, HD; Aguiar, OP; Caldas, RB; Fakury, RH",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110805,"[Cardoso, Hermano de Sousa] Univ Coimbra, ISISE Dept Civil Engn, Coimbra, Portugal; [Aguiar, Otavio Prates; Caldas, Rodrigo Barreto; Fakury, Ricardo Hallal] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Struct Engn, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0141-0296,
WoS,Assessment of the mechanical behaviour of reinforcement bars with localised pitting corrosion by Digital Image Correlation,"Corrosion of reinforcement in concrete impairs the mechanical behaviour of rebars by decreasing their strength and deformation capacity. In this study, uniaxial tensile tests were carried out on 61 rebars taken from 22 pre- and un- cracked reinforced concrete beams subjected to drying and wetting cycles in chloride solution for over three years. A 3D-scanning technique was used to characterise the maximum local corrosion level, mu(max), and different pit shape parameters. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to capture the displacement field of the test bars; the engineering strain was measured through the virtual extensometers created in the DIC post-processing software. The proof and ultimate forces showed linear decreasing trends of mu(max), while the proof and ultimate strengths (based on the minimum residual cross-sectional area) were not obviously affected by corrosion. The ultimate strain of corroded bars depended on the gauge length due to strain localisation in the pit. Thus, it was emphasised that the ultimate strain may be overestimated if measured based on a short gauge across the pit. It was also observed that when mu(max) exceeded a critical local corrosion level (mu(crit) depending on the ratio between the yield and ultimate strengths of the steel), the region outside the pit did not develop yielding. A lower bound of ultimate strain was further derived as a function of the mechanical parameters of uncorroded steel and maximum local corrosion level. This provided a good comparison with the experimental results. Ultimately, a hypothesis for time-dependent assessment of strain capacity is proposed, considering the evolution of corrosion morphology over time.",Pitting corrosion; Mechanical properties; Strain measurement; 3D-scanning; Digital Image Correlation,"Chen, E; Berrocal, CG; Fernandez, I; Lofgren, I; Lundgren, K",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110936,"[Chen, E.; Berrocal, Carlos G.; Fernandez, Ignasi; Lofgren, Ingemar; Lundgren, Karin] Chalmers Univ Technol, Div Struct Engn, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Berrocal, Carlos G.; Lofgren, Ingemar] Thomas Concrete Grp AB, Sodra Vagen 28, S-41254 Gothenburg, Sweden",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0141-0296,
WoS,Derivation of fragility curves at design stage through linear time-history analysis,"The aim of this work is to open up new opportunities for designers towards a performance-based approach to derive fragilities at design stage. Nonlinear Time-History Analysis (NTHA) represents the current practice for the estimation of damage within the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) framework. Among the NTHA approaches for fragility assessment, Cloud Analysis (CA) represents a convenient tool which allows evaluating the parameters of the conditional demand distribution based on simple regression of cloud-dispersed data points obtained from recorded ground motions. Notwithstanding the growth in computer processing power and software development, NTHA is generally time-consuming and it requires advanced expertise in nonlinear modelling, preventing its use in the professional field at design stage. Herein, a novel procedure for deriving fragility curves built up through Linear Time-History Analysis (LTHA) and CA is presented. It can be employed within a simplified PBEE approach at design stage for performance comparison of design solutions. Differences between LTHA results and those obtained through NTHA are compared for the assessment of a 12-storey Reinforced-Concrete Moment-Resisting-Frame building designed according to Eurocode 8. Assessment is performed for two limit states: Life Safety- and Damage Limitation- Limit State. Critical aspects for LTHA-based fragility assessment such as (i) influence of ground motion suite size and (ii) identification of unacceptable cases are investigated. The final level of approximation of these design-fragilities is very satisfactory making the full approach pursuable and useful for professional applications.",Time-history analysis; Eurocode 8; Ground motion selection; Fragility curves; Cloud analysis; Unacceptable cases,"Lombardi, L; De Luca, F",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110900,"[Lombardi, Luca; De Luca, Flavia] Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol, Avon, England",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0141-0296,
WoS,Simplified numerical approach for the lateral load analysis of light-frame wood shear wall structures,"Increasing global demand for a sustainable society is driving the development of multi-storey light-frame wood structures, yet their complex structural components make detailed finite element modelling (FEM) impractical. The structural response of these buildings cannot typically be accurately captured with traditional simplified computational methods that rely on the use of parameter-based spring hysteretic properties or mathematical derivation. This paper proposes a powerful simplified nonlinear FEM procedure capable of accurately and efficiently capturing the responses of single-storey and multi-storey light-frame wood shear wall structures with respect to lateral displacement against base shear. The proposed procedure involves the separation of flexural and shear deformations from the total deformation resulting from the detailed model pushover analysis. The nonlinear curves of these deformation components against base shear are used to develop the properties of simplified axial and shear link models based on an approach equating external and internal work. To demonstrate the accuracy of the simplified FEM in conducting pushover analysis for structures with different structural details, 6 single-storey shear walls and 4 four-storey shear walls were modelled using this nonlinear simplified FEM analysis procedure. Compared with detailed FEM procedure, the developed simplified FEM method accurately captured the pushover analysis results with acceptable discrepancies and significantly less computational time. This proposed simplified procedure has the potential for wide applicability in structural design and analysis through the establishment of a simplified model database and the embedment of this database into any commonly used commercial FEM software.",Light-frame wood structure; Detailed FEM; Simplified FEM; Pushover analysis,"Peng, C; El Damatty, AA; Musa, A; Hamada, A",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110921,"[Peng, Chu; El Damatty, Ashraf A.; Musa, Ahmed; Hamada, Ahmed] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [El Damatty, Ashraf A.] Univ Western Ontario, WindEEE Res Inst, London, ON N6M 0E2, Canada; [El Damatty, Ashraf A.] Cairo Univ, Dept Struct Engn, Giza 12613, Egypt",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0141-0296,
WoS,A comparative study of linear and nonlinear mass damping systems under seismic excitation,"A comparative study of the seismic response of structures equipped with linear and nonlinear mass damping systems is presented herein. Three optimized mass damping systems mounted at the top of a linearly elastic two - degree -of -freedom building are tested under an artificial seismic motion to assess their response. The artificial seismic motion is generated using the SIMQKE software and matching a specific response spectrum. The mass damping systems consist of (i) a Linear Mass Damper (LMD), (ii) a type -I Nonlinear Energy Sink (NES) with a nonlinear elastic spring of the cubic oscillator, and (iii) a Friction Nonlinear Energy Sink (FNES) which extends the NES with a friction element and a linear elastic spring of potentially negative stiffness. The results for each configuration are validated with a set of real scaled ground motion time histories matching the same specific spectrum, and a quantification of the response variability in relation to the input variability is attempted. An interesting observation is that the artificially generated excitation consistently underestimates critical design/ response quantities, as compared to the average response of the set of real ground motions.",Seismic response; Linear mass damper; Nonlinear energy sink; Friction nonlinear energy sink,"Tsiatas, GC; Charalampakis, AE; Tsopelas, P",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110926,"[Tsiatas, George C.] Univ Patras, Dept Math, GR-26504 Rion, Greece; [Charalampakis, Aristotelis E.] Univ West Attica, Dept Civil Engn, GR-12244 Athens, Greece; [Tsopelas, Panos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys Sci, GR-15773 Athens, Greece",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0141-0296,
WoS,Research on numerical model for flexural behaviors analysis of precast concrete segmental box girders,"Precast concrete segmental girders (PCSGs) have recently become widely used construction technologies owing to their significant construction -related advantages. However, the segmental joints cause structural dis- continuities, which generate more complicated mechanical behaviors than those observed with monolithic girders. Specifically, for PCSGs with external tendons, increasing attention is being paid to their structural analysis and design. In this paper, a new highly efficient numerical model is proposed for flexural behavior analysis of PCSGs over all the elastoplastic loading states. The proposed model is a beam -tendon element hybrid model comprising three components: the concrete box girder segment element, multi -node slipping tendon element and joint element. All of the elements are built considering the crucial mechanical behavior of PCSGs. A 10 degree -of -freedom (DOF) fiber beam element is proposed as the segment element to consider the shear lag effects, geometric and materially nonlinear behavior of the concrete box girder. A multi -node co -rotational slipping tendon element is proposed to model the slip effect and stiffness contribution of the un-bonded or external tendons. The discontinuous mechanical behavior between the segments is simulated using plain con- crete joint elements with a modified constitutive relation based on the equivalent of the cracking and crushing energy. The finite element (FE) formulas and the modified method are deduced and presented in the paper and then implemented in OpenSees software as newly developed elements. Utilizing the developed procedure, the proposed model is thoroughly validated through comparisons with several scaled and full-scale experimental results, including structural deformations, ultimate capacity, traction increments of tendons and the width of the open joints. The results reveal the superior applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed model compared with previous models. Finally, the model is applied to a practice bridge for structural performance analysis under service and ultimate states. The applicability of the current design formulas is discussed based on the analytical results of the proposed model.",Precast concrete segmental box girders; Prestressed tendons; Joint; Flexural behavior; Numerical model,"Yan, WT; Han, B; Xie, HB; Li, PF; Zhu, L",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110733,"[Yan, Wu-Tong; Han, Bing; Xie, Hui-Bing; Zhu, Li] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Han, Bing] Minist Transport, Key Lab Safety & Risk Management Transport Infras, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Li, Peng-Fei] Minist Transport, Res Inst Highway, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0141-0296,

Later, triaxial compression strength data are used to calibrate the constitutive parameters of the Holmquist -Johnson -Cook (HJC) model for CTB.

WoS,Identification of potential human COX-2 inhibitors using computational modeling and molecular dynamics simulations,"To explore the structure-property relationship in a set of molecules against Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking and 3D-QSAR studies were performed. A set of 66 reported molecules with different scaffolds having pIC(50) values ranging from 8.886 to 4.342 were considered to create a model that can efficiently explain the essential features required for the inhibition of COX-2 and to generate a model that alleviates in distinguishing molecules that have good efficiency. Computational modeling and molecular dynamics simulation approaches are used to identify a new potential COX2 inhibitor. The Molecular screening was performed by using different sequential methods right from Pharmacophore based virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations using Maestro11.9 software. Based on the best pharmacophore model (AHRRR_7), the resultant set of 56,480 molecules were screened from the set of 12,16,239 molecules (from ZINC15 database). The preliminarily screened molecules were subjected to molecular docking (PDB_ID: 5F1A) for the further screening through HTVS (High Throughput Virtual Screening), SP (Standard Precision) and XP (Extra Precision) methods. A set of 20 molecules was selected from the resultant molecular docking outcomes (360 molecules) based on the best docking score. Lipinski's rule of five validates the pharmaceutical bioac- tivity of all 20 molecules. Out of 20 molecules, 4 were selected as the best molecules based on their docking score and ligand-receptor interaction diagram and further subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Outcomes of the present study conclude with a new molecule ( SB2) which shows the best interactions for the inhibition of human COX-2 enzyme in comparison to the reported molecules.

Both the objective of minimizing the number of nonzero components, the so-called l(0)-norm, as well as its popular substitute, the l(1)-norm, are covered. Furthermore, integrality constraints and possible bounds on the variables are investigated. Our results show that the additional prior knowledge of signal integrality allows for recovering more signals than what can be guaranteed by the established recovery conditions from (continuous) compressed sensing. Moreover, even though the considered problems are NP-hard in general (even with an l(1)-objective), we investigate testing the l(0)-recovery conditions via some numerical experiments. It turns out that the corresponding problems are quite hard to solve in practice using black-box software. However, medium-sized instances of l(0)- and l(1)-minimization with binary variables can be solved exactly within reasonable time. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Quantitative software reliability assessment methodology based on Bayesian belief networks and statistical testing for safety-critical software,"This study proposes an overall methodology that provides in-depth evidence on software reliability. It is used to quantitatively assess the reliability of nuclear power plant (NPP) safety-critical software for the incorporation of digital instrumentation and control systems into NPP probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). The methodology consists of three parts: (1) the relationships among the software development life cycle (SDLC) phases, the number of remaining faults in the software, and the probability of failure on demand (PFD) are modeled by a Bayesian belief network, which can provide a prior distribution of the software PFD; (2) a reliability model for the PFD is used to calculate the number of no-failure tests needed to meet the expected reliability target according to the prior distribution; (3) the software statistical testing (SST) based on PRA is used as a reliability validation test method to assess reliability, when the required no-failure tests are completed, it is considered that the software meets the expected reliability target. The main contribution of this methodology is that it fully considers the factors that affect software reliability, i.e. the quality of development activities and verification & validation (V&V) activities of the SDLC processes, software operational profile and software operational environment when assessing software reliability. This is done such that the methodology overcomes the subjectivity of separate quality assessments of the SDLC processes. It also solves the problem that occurs because an individual SST using an uninformative prior distribution is conservative. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Handling B models in the PERF integrated verification framework: Formalised and certified embedding,"The design of complex systems involves several design models supporting different analysis techniques for validation and verification purposes. These activities lead to the definition of heterogeneous modelling languages and analysis techniques. In this setting, meeting certification standards becomes a key issue in system engineering. Reducing heterogeneity due to the presence of different modelling languages can be addressed by providing an integrated framework in which modelling languages and techniques are formalised. In such a framework, checking the global correctness of heterogeneous models of a complex critical system becomes possible in many cases. The work presented in this paper addresses the problem of integrated verification of system design models in the context of transportation systems, in particular railway systems. It has been achieved in context of the B-PERFect project of RATP (Parisian Public Transport Operator and Maintainer) aiming at applying formal verification using the PERF approach on the integrated safety-critical models of embedded software related to railway domain expressed in a single unifying modelling language: HLL. This paper addresses the particular case of the B method. It presents a certified translation of B formal models to HLL models. The proposed approach uses Isabelle/HOL as a unified logical framework to describe the formal semantics and to formalise the transformation relation between both modelling languages. The developed Isabelle/HOL models are proved in order to guarantee the correctness of our translation process. Moreover, we have also used weak-bisimulation relation to check the correctness of each translation step. We also show that, when models are translated into this unified modelling language, it becomes possible to handle the verification of properties expressed across different models. The overall approach is illustrated through a case study issued from a railway software system: on-board localisation function. Furthermore, it discusses the integrated verification at system level.

WoS,Dynamic creation of source code models for the extraction of code metrics data through grammar querying,"Source code metrics extraction is a complex task that has to be done automatically given the current size of software. They are extracted using software metric tools and more generic extraction mechanisms. These mechanisms usually work by querying a source code representation model. These models are static, and the information that can be obtained from them is limited. In this work an extraction methodology is presented in which the model is created every time certain information is needed. This is accomplished by querying the language context-free grammar, and from the information obtained by the query, a dynamic model is created. Current extraction mechanisms work by querying a model, while the proposed methodology queries the grammar directly, thus the model is created afterwards from the query result, and contains all the needed information. A metrics tool is created based on the proposed methodology, and in order to prove the correct functioning of extracting the desired information from the source code, not as already predefined as in current tools, several metrics are extracted as defined by four existing metrics tools. Querying the language grammar allows access to all available data in the source code, regardless of the programming language and paradigm. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,A generic reverse osmosis model for full-scale operation,"Mathematical models can be a powerful tool in the operation of reverse osmosis (RO) facilities which is often challenged by a varying feed water quality. Most models, however, do not consider both full-scale and good modelling practice, which makes them less suited in practice. In this paper, a generic steady state model for RO was set-up and applied to a unique three-year data set from a full-scale RO process according to state-of-the-art good modelling practice. It was found that the model outputs are most sensitive towards the water and the solute permeability, and the feed spacer channel height, and therefore, only these parameters were calibrated. Furthermore, manufacturer's tests do not always reflect the full-scale situation, which highlights the importance of calibration. The model was validated with online conductivity data as input taking into account the uncertainty originating from online sensors, and compared to the commercial software Winflows. Despite the lack of long-term predictive power since fouling was not included, the model with online conductivity data as input showed satisfactory results, i.e. an average deviation from the data of 2.7%, 12.7%, 34.1% and 18.7% for respectively the recovery, the concentrate pressure, the permeate and concentrate solute concentration.",Reverse osmosis; Full-scale; Global sensitivity analysis; Calibration; Validation,"Gaublomme, D; Strubbe, L; Vanoppen, M; Torfs, E; Mortier, S; Cornelissen, E; De Gusseme, B; Verliefde, A; Nopens, I",2020.0,Journal,DESALINATION,10.1016/j.desal.2020.114509,"[Gaublomme, Dorien; Strubbe, Laurence; Torfs, Elena; Mortier, Severine; Nopens, Ingmar] Univ Ghent, Dept Data Anal & Math Modelling, BIOMATH, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vanoppen, Marjolein; Cornelissen, Emile; Verliefde, Arne] Univ Ghent, Dept Green Chem & Technol, PainT, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Cornelissen, Emile] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Environm & Water Res Inst, Singapore Membrane Technol Ctr, Singapore 637141, Singapore; [Cornelissen, Emile] Water Res Inst, KWR, Groningenhaven 7, NL-3433 PE Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [De Gusseme, Bart] Univ Ghent, Dept Biotechnol, CMET, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [De Gusseme, Bart] TMVW, FARYS, Stropstr 1, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Gaublomme, Dorien; Strubbe, Laurence; Vanoppen, Marjolein; Torfs, Elena; Mortier, Severine; Cornelissen, Emile; De Gusseme, Bart; Verliefde, Arne; Nopens, Ingmar] Ctr Adv Proc Technol Urban Resource Recovery, CAPTURE, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",ELSEVIER,English,0011-9164,
WoS,Network pharmacology-based strategy to investigate pharmacological mechanisms of Tinospora sinensis for treatment of Alzheimer's disease,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tinospora sinensis (Lour.) Merr. belongs to the family Menispermaceae. It is called LeZhe and is widely used as a kind of folk medicine especially in the Tibetan Plateau of China. T. sinensis has the functions of clearing away heat and detoxification, dispelling wind and dredging collaterals, calming and soothing the nerves. T. sinensis is an effective medicine for the prevention and treatment of aging diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Tibetan Plateau of China, whereas its material basis and underlying mechanisms are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the material basis and potential mechanisms of T. sinensis in the treatment of AD by using network pharmacology and molecular docking. Materials and methods: In this study, targets were collected from DrugBank database, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) and literatures reports for the treatment of AD. Compounds were searched by literatures and systematic separation from T. sinensis. The molecular docking experiment was carried out by using Autodock Vina software to screen the bioactive compounds in T. sinensis and target proteins for AD. Then, the compoundtarget network was constructed by Cytoscape software. The drug-like properties of the active compounds were analyzed by pKCSM performs, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) target pathway enrichment analysis was carried out by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Furthermore, the protective effect of neurons of two active compounds were verified with the injury cell model of PC12 and primary hippocampus neurons induced by A beta(25-35). Finally, the key proteins of related pathways were quantitatively analyzed with Western blot method. Results: In total, 105 compounds and 38 targets have been screened. The main active compounds contained berberine, which belongs to alkaloids, Aurantiamide acetate, N-P-coumaroyltyramine, which belongs to amides, Trans-syringin and 3-demethyl-phillyrin, which belongs to phenylpropanoids. The targets covered inflammationrelated proteins, including Protein kinase B (AKT), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Neuronal NOS (NOS1), and cholinergic function-related proteins, including alpha 4-Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 4 nAChR), Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (Muscarnic M1). Inflammation and cholinergic dysfunction were the center of the network and occupy a dominant position. And the results of enrichment analysis shown the pathways mainly contained phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signal pathway, neurotrophic factors (NTFs) signal pathway, Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signal pathway, mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathway, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signal pathway, insulin resistance (IR). The results of in vitro assays showed that the tested compounds could significantly improve the survival rate and inhibit the apoptosis of PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons injured by A beta(25-35). Western blot results showed that T. sinensis had a significant effect on the expression of protein PI3K and Akt. Conclusion: Our results revealed that T. sinensis could prevent and treat AD through a multi-compound-multi-target-multi-pathway regulatory network. Our work also expected to provide new ideas and theoretical bases for searching for the active compounds in T. sinensis and potential mechanism in the prevention and treatment of AD by the network pharmacology and molecular docking.

WoS,Particle imaging auto-measurement system for microphysical characteristics of raindrops in natural rain,"In order to explore microphysical properties of raindrops, light field and imaging system were designed based on the particle imaging measurement technology. Meanwhile, the software for image identification, extraction and calculation were investigated, and then a raindrop measurement system combined with a charge coupled device sensor was developed. The repeatability and accuracy of steel ball estimation were checked in diameter and fall velocity and yielded low standard deviations and small relative errors. The results demonstrate that the system provides a reliable detection of raindrop size and fall velocity. Additionally, the designed system was operated for in situ measurement of natural rain. Raindrop diameter and fall velocity were, on average, 1.02 mm and 3.45 m s(-1), respectively, and small-sized particles were the predominant contributor to the natural rainfall. Notably, raindrop fall velocities were slightly higher than the corresponding terminal velocities calculated by classical models under the standard sea-level conditions. In order to identify completely the features and variations of raindrops, it is essential to implement long-term measurements and take into account the driving factors such as air motions, raindrop breakup or coalescence.

WoS,Calibration of hyperelastic material models for structural silicone and hybrid polymer adhesives for the application of bonded glass,"To enable the introduction of new developments and concepts of bonded glass in facades, finite element modelling is a frequently used method. The implementation of the complex material behaviour of suitable adhesives into such software, however, can be labour-intensive. Usually, hyperelastic material models need to be calibrated, i.e. theoretical mathematical expressions are fitted to experimentally obtained data. In this research, three two-component structural silicones and one two-component hybrid polymer adhesive were selected. Experimental tests on H-specimens in correspondence with ETAG 002 were performed for tension, compression and simple shear at different haul-off speeds of the testing machine, more specifically 1 mm/min, 5 mm/min, 50 mm/min and 500 mm/min. The stress-strain response of the adhesives altered with different test speeds. The material response under cyclic loading regime was investigated as well. These tests confirmed the presence of strain softening, also referred to as the Mullins effect, in all selected adhesives. Next, twenty isochoric hyperelastic material models were calibrated with the experimental data of the monotonic load tests at a speed of 5 mm/min for single, dual and triple deformation states. A theoretical estimator of the relative quality of the material models, more specifically the Akaike Information Criterion, allowed for the selection of the models that fit the experimental data the best. For all investigated adhesives, the polynomial based hyperelastic material models provided the best fit. This paper presents the results of the experimental programme that enable researchers to compare numerical and analytical analyses with these results. Designers and engineers can compare the structural performance of the adhesives in correspondence with ETAG 002 and assess the importance of cyclic loading regimes in the design of bonded glass. The calibrated hyperelastic material models allow engineers to numerically implement hyperelastic material behaviour of the studied adhesives in correspondence with ETAG 002. The best-performing material model for the considered application needs to be selected and the numerical model needs to be validated using the results of additional experiments on the considered bonded glass application. Especially the calibrated material models for multiple deformation states are valuable to model complex stress distributions in bonded glass applications subjected to multiple deformation states.

Here, we investigate samples of different complexity all measured at the Pt L-3 absorption edge to determine the optimal procedure for the analysis of the experimental XRMR curves, especially for nontrivial bi- and multilayer samples that include differently bonded Pt from layer to layer. The software tool REMAGX is used to fit these data and model the magnetooptic depth profiles based on a highly adaptable layer stack which is modified to be a more precise and physically consistent representation of the real multilayer system. Various fitting algorithms, iterative optimization approaches and a detailed analysis of the asymmetry ratio features as well as chi(2) (goodness of fit) landscapes are utilized to improve the agreement between measurements and simulations.

WoS,Highlights of the novel dewaterability estimation test (DET) device,"Many industries, which are producing sludge in large quantities, depend on sludge dewatering technology to reduce the corresponding water content. A key design parameter for dewatering equipment is the capillary suction time (CST) test, which has, however, several scientific flaws, despite that the test is practical and easy-to-perform. The standard CST test has a few considerable drawbacks: its lack of reliability and difficulties in obtaining results for heavy sludge types. Furthermore, it is not designed for long experiments (e.g. >30 min), and has only two measurement points (its two electrodes). In comparison, the novel dewaterability estimation test (DET) test is almost as simple as the CST, but considerably more reliable, faster, flexible and informative in terms of the wealth of visual measurement data collected with modern image analysis software. The standard deviations associated with repeated measurements for the same sludge is lower for the DET than for the CST test. In contrast to the CST device, capillary suction in the DET test is linear and not radial, allowing for a straightforward interpretation of findings. The new DET device may replace the CST test in the sludge-producing industries in the future.",Capillary suction time; filter paper property; image processing technology; resistance to filtration; sludge treatment; water technology,"Scholz, M; Almuktar, S; Clausner, C; Antonacopoulos, A",2020.0,Journal,ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,10.1080/09593330.2019.1575916,"[Scholz, Miklas; Almuktar, Suhad; Clausner, Christian; Antonacopoulos, Apostolos] Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Lund, Sweden; [Scholz, Miklas] Univ Salford, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Salford, Lancs, England; [Scholz, Miklas] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Civil Engn Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Almuktar, Suhad] Univ Basrah, Dept Architectural Engn, Al Basrah, Iraq",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,English,0959-3330,

This study aims to compare 2-dimensional intraoperative radiographic RadLink measurements of acetabular component position with 3-dimensional postoperative 3D SterEOS measurements. Methods: Intraoperative fluoroscopy and RadLink (El Segundo, CA, USA) were used to measure acetabular cup position intraoperatively in 48 consecutive patients undergoing DAA THA. Cup position was measured on 6-week postoperative standing EOS images using 3D SterEOS software (EOS Imaging, SA, Paris, France) and compared to RadLink findings using Student's t-test. Safe-zone outliers were identified. We evaluated for measurement difference of > +/- 5 degrees. Results: RadLink acetabular cup abduction measurement (mean 43.0 degrees) was not significantly different than 3D SterEOS in the anatomic plane (mean 42.6 degrees,p= 0.50) or in the functional plane (mean 42.7 degrees,p= 0.61). RadLink acetabular cup anteversion measurement (mean 17.9 degrees) was significantly different than 3D SterEOS in both the anatomic plane (mean 20.6 degrees,p= 0.022) and the functional plane (mean 21.2 degrees,p= 0.002). RadLink identified 2 cups outside of the safe-zone. However, SterEOS identified 12 (anatomic plane) and 10 (functional plane) outside of the safe-zone. In the functional plane, 58% of anteversion and 92% of abduction RadLink measurements were within +/- 5 degrees of 3D SterEOS.

Materials and Methods This was a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. The healthy subjects who were candidates for maxillary ridge expansion were included in this experiment. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: piezosurgery group and surgical disc group. The width of the bone in the surgical site was measured by surgical calliper before the osteotomy. The bone width was remeasured after ridge-split completion (before suturing) and during the implant placement (4 months later). Then data were analysed by SPSS software, and thePvalue was set at 0.05. Results The study sample size included 20 cases. Our outcomes showed that both techniques (surgical disc and piezotome) were effective in ridge splitting (P < 0.001). However, the average bone width which was obtained after ridge splitting was significantly higher in the piezosurgery group (P < 0.05).

The efficiency offered by new technology to conventional model surgery can return hours to a surgeon's day through a more streamlined work-up and smoother intra-operative experience with confidence in the surgical accuracy. Continuous quality improvement has been a mantra in health care for many years. Surgeons are always looking to improve not only the quality of their results but also the consistency with which these results are achieved.

WoS,Convolutional neural networks for direct detection of dark matter,"The XENON1T experiment uses a time projection chamber (TPC) with liquid xenon to search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a proposed dark matter particle, via direct detection. As this experiment relies on capturing rare events, the focus is on achieving a high recall of WIMP events. Hence the ability to distinguish between WIMP and the background is extremely important. To accomplish this, we suggest using convolutional neural networks (CNNs); a machine learning procedure mainly used in image recognition tasks. To explore this technique we use XENON collaboration open-source software to simulate the TPC graphical output of dark matter signals and main backgrounds. A CNN turns out to be a suitable tool for this purpose, as it can identify features in the images that differentiate the two types of events without the need to manipulate or remove data in order to focus on a particular region of the detector. We find that the CNN can distinguish between the dominant background events (ER) and 500 GeV WIMP events with a recall of 93.4%, precision of 81.2% and an accuracy of 87.2%.",dark matter; dark matter detection; neural networks; xenon1T; WIMPs,"Khosa, CK; Mars, L; Richards, J; Sanz, V",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF PHYSICS G-NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS,10.1088/1361-6471/ab8e94,"[Khosa, Charanjit K.; Mars, Lucy; Richards, Joel; Sanz, Veronica] Univ Sussex, Dept Phys & Astron, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England; [Sanz, Veronica] British Lib, Alan Turing Inst, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England; [Sanz, Veronica] Univ Valencia, CSIC, Inst Fis Corpuscular IFIC, E-46980 Valencia, Spain",IOP PUBLISHING LTD,English,0954-3899,
WoS,Abnormal EEG Power Spectrum in Individuals with High Autistic Personality Traits: an eLORETA Study,"Autistic traits lie on a continuously distributed spectrum ranging from non-clinical to clinical conditions. Indeed, autistic traits have been observed in general population at sub-threshold levels. Here, the main aim was to investigate differences in resting state (RS) electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum in individuals with high vs. low autistic traits. Fifty undergraduates completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and the Empathy Quotient (EQ). For each participant five minutes of RS-EEG were recorded and analysed by means of the exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography software (eLORETA). A Two-Step Cluster Analysis revealed two groups: high autistic traits (AT+) and low autistic traits (AT-) group. Compared to AT-, AT+ individuals showed an increase of delta power in parietal/occipital and cortico-limbic areas. No alterations were observed in other frequency bands. Furthermore, both AQ and EQ total scores were positively correlated with delta EEG power after controlling for sex, age, and subclinical psychopathological traits. Results show that AT+ individuals exhibit an increase in slow RS EEG power in regions involved in self-referential processes, suggesting a reduction in these internally directed mental activities and adding new evidence on the existence of a continuum in the autistic spectrum which spreads from clinical to non-clinical significance.",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autism Spectrum quotient; Autistic traits; EEG power spectra; eLORETA; Empathy quotient; Personality; Psychopathology,"Massullo, C; Imperatori, C; Adenzato, M; Brunetti, R; Indraccolo, A; Della Marca, G; Farina, B; Ardito, RB",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT,10.1007/s10862-019-09777-4,"[Massullo, Chiara; Imperatori, Claudio; Brunetti, Riccardo; Indraccolo, Allegra; Farina, Benedetto] European Univ Rome, Dept Human Sci, Rome, Italy; [Adenzato, Mauro] Univ Turin, Dept Psychol, Via Verdi 10, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Della Marca, Giacomo] Catholic Univ, Inst Neurol, Rome, Italy; [Ardito, Rita B.] Univ Turin, Dept Neurosci Rita Levi Montalcini, Turin, Italy",SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,English,0882-2689,
WoS,Conveyor belt structure of belt dryer: Analysis and optimization,"The chain drive conveyor belt (CDCB) of the belt dryer is prone to generate impact load during operation, and the conveyor belt bedplate (CBB) will cause fatigue damage and fracture. This study presents an approach for calculating fatigue life, which combines the automatic dynamic analysis of mechanical systems (ADAMS), finite element analysis software (ANSYS), fatigue analysis software (FE-SAFE), and experimental stress analysis. The virtual prototype model for simulation of the CDCB is established, and its motion stability, contact impact force and motion trajectory are analyzed. The study shows that the chain drive polygon effect will cause periodic changes in velocity, and the motion trajectory has very good similarity. The stress experiment results show that the stress was considerable during the chain drive meshing process. The finite element analysis results show that the maximum stress of the old CBB is higher than the yield strength of the material, and the equivalent stress of the new CBB is lower than that of the old CBB. The area of the maximum stress of old CBB presents a fracture, which indicates the fatigue failure of the old CBB. The finite element calculation results were imported into FE-SAFE for fatigue life analysis, which compared the fatigue cycle number and safety factor of the old CBB and the new CBB. The results show that the new CBB can extend the service life of the belt dryer. The proposed analytical method for fatigue life is simple and effective and can serve as a reference for the fatigue life analysis of the key components of the belt dryer.",Belt dryer; Conveyor belt bedplate (CBB); Fatigue life; Analysis; Optimization,"Jia, HP; Wu, K; Wang, Y; Sun, Y",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS,10.1016/j.engfailanal.2020.104686,"[Jia, Hepeng; Wu, Kai; Wang, Yu; Sun, Yu] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, 200 Xiaolingwei St, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,1350-6307,
WoS,Failure analysis of a Portuguese cultural heritage masterpiece: Bonet building in Sintra,"The paper addresses the failure analysis under horizontal loads of the most ancient body of the National Palace of Sintra, Portugal: the Bonet building. This is a URM construction built on top of Arabic foundations during the reign of King Denis of Portugal around 1281; since then, few altera-tions have been made to the building. Due to the exemplary conservation of the whole palace, a few crack patterns are identified only on the top floor of the Bonet building, an area that is not open to visitors and that will soon undergo restoration works. The seismic vulnerability assessment of this building is carried out following two different approaches, enacted in two distinct numerical models: the so-called Equivalent Frame Method (EFM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) developed in 3Muri and ABAQUS software, respectively. Both approaches adopt a numerical procedure based on the use of nonlinear static analyses, introducing equivalent boundary conditions that are defined to consider, approximately and conventionally, the possible interaction effects among the different parts of the structure. To minimize the multiple uncertainties usually existing in complex masonry buildings, whether related to geometry or masonry mechanical properties, a detailed structural survey is conducted through the laser scanning technology as well as in situ experimental tests. Different types of experimental tests are carried out, both non-and semi-destructive, including a Ground Penetrating Radar test, ambient vibration tests, flat-jack tests, and the collection of masonry samples. All these tests are important to adequately characterize the building and to calibrate the numerical models. Moreover, these tests enable the extraction of values for the mechanical properties of the rubble stone masonry that are used in the later numerical simulations on the Bonet building and, most importantly, can be used as a reference for future works regarding historical Portuguese monuments of the same period. Afterwards, the results obtained from the nonlinear static analyses with the two different software 3Muri and ABAQUS are presented and discussed. Specifically, the differences in modelling strategies and characterization of materials between the two software are considered with special regard to their feasibility, required computational effort, data availability and applicability to large scale structures. Efforts to calibrate and obtain the same behavior of the building for the different software are made, involving geometry, boundary conditions and char-acterization of the material constitutive laws. Eventually, a nonlinear dynamic analysis is carried out in ABAQUS to further assess the seismic vulnerability of the Bonet building; a spectrum-compatible accelerogram is applied to the numerical model, and the time-history of displacements in relevant control points of the buildings are extracted and discussed.",Behavior at failure; Historic masonry building; Seismic vulnerability assessment; Finite element method; Nonlinear static analyses; Nonlinear dynamic analyses,"Malcata, M; Ponte, M; Tiberti, S; Bento, R; Milani, G",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS,10.1016/j.engfailanal.2020.104636,"[Malcata, Madalena; Ponte, Madalena; Bento, Rita] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS, Ave Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Tiberti, Simone; Milani, Gabriele] Tech Univ Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm & Construct Engn, Piazza Leonardo Da Vinci, I-20133 Milan, Italy",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,1350-6307,
WoS,High-Switching-Frequency TCM Digital Control for Bidirectional-Interleaved Buck Converters Without Phase Error for Battery Charging,"This article proposes a high-performance, high-switching-frequency triangular-conduction-mode (TCM) bidirectional-interleaved buck converter for battery charging using digital control. Accurate conditions for achieving zero-voltage switching (ZVS) without zero-crossing detection (ZCD) are derived while considering the nonlinear parasitic capacitance of the switch components. This article also optimizes the method of calculating the switching frequency to reduce the delay time of pulsewidth modulation, thereby enhancing system stability. The conventional control method has inadequate resolution in the phase shift register of the digital controller under high switching frequency, hindering perfect interleaving of the two phases at 180 degrees, which affects the characteristics of current ripple offset. The proposed control method effectively reduces the phase error between the two phases in an interleaving structure under high-frequency operation. In this way, full-range ZVS can be achieved when the circuit operates at the correct switching frequency. ANSYS Q3D Extractor software is employed to simulate the impedances of the power loops and investigate parasitic parameters, enabling optimization of the layout and modification of the switching frequency. An experimental prototype of a bidirectional buck converter using GaN switches was implemented with an output power of 1 kW, an input voltage of 66 V, an output voltage of 35-50 V, a switching frequency of 350 kHz-1 MHz, a highest efficiency of 97.52%, and a power density of 10 W/cm(3).",Zero voltage switching; Switching frequency; Buck converters; Switches; Inductors; Layout; Batteries; Bidirectional buck converter; current balancing; high frequency; high power density; nonphase error; zero-voltage switching (ZVS),"Liu, YC; Syu, YL; Dung, NA; Chen, C; Chen, KD; Kim, KA",2020.0,Journal,IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS,10.1109/JESTPE.2019.2954602,"[Liu, Yu-Chen] Natl Ilan Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Yilan 206, Taiwan; [Syu, Yong-Long; Chen, Chen; Chen, Kai-De] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Taipei 10607, Taiwan; [Dung, Nguyen Anh] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Bradley Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Kim, Katherine A.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,2168-6777,
WoS,An Active Impedance-Source Three-Level T-Type Inverter With Reduced Device Count,"In this paper, a single-stage active impedance source three-phase T-type inverter is proposed with a reduced component count. Besides the inherent features of the three-level (TL) impedance-source inverters-shoot-through (ST) immunity, single-stage power conversion, and continuous input current-the proposed inverter has additional advantages such as increased voltage gain, reduced passive element count, and low voltage stress on devices. Furthermore, the self-balance capacitor voltage capability is the other feature of the proposed inverter. The steady-state analysis, operating principles, and parameter selection guidelines are presented in detail for the proposed inverter. Pulsewidth modulation (PWM) techniques for the proposed inverter including the sinusoidal PWM method and the modified space-vector modulation scheme for common-mode voltage reduction are also presented. A comprehensive comparison between the proposed inverter and other TL impedance-source inverters is shown.

WoS,Women's unmet needs in early labour: Qualitative analysis of free-text survey responses in the M@NGO trial of caseload midwifery,"Objective: to analyse women's experiences of early labour care in caseload midwifery in Australia. Design: this study sits within a multi-site randomised controlled trial of caseload midwifery versus standard care. Participant surveys were conducted at 6-weeks and 6-months after birth. Free-text responses about experiences of care were subject to critical thematic analysis in NVivo 11 software. Setting: two urban Australian hospitals in different states. Participants: women 18 years and over, with a singleton pregnancy, less than 24 weeks' pregnant, not planning a caesarean section or already booked with a care provider; were eligible to participate in the trial. Interventions: participants were randomised to caseload midwifery or standard care for antenatal, labour and birth and postpartum care. Measurements and findings: The 6-week survey response rate was 58% (n = 1,019). The survey included five open questions about women's experiences of pregnancy, labour and birth, and postnatal care. Nine-hundred and one respondents (88%) provided free text comments which were coded to generate 10 categories. The category of early labour contained data from 84 individual participants (caseload care n = 44; standard care n = 40). Descriptive themes were: (1) needing permission; (2) doing the 'wrong' thing; and (3) being dismissed. Analytic themes were: (1) Seeking: women wanting to be close to those who know what's going on; and (2) Shielding: midwives defending resources and normal birth. Key conclusions: Regardless of model of care, early labour care was primarily described in negative terms. This could be attributed to reporting bias, because women who were neutral about early labour care may not comment. Nevertheless, the findings demonstrate a gap in knowledge about early labour care in caseload midwifery models. Implications for practice: Maternity services that offer caseload midwifery are ideally placed to evaluate how early labour home visiting impacts women's experiences of early labour.

We rely on a detailed qualitative case analysis of collaborations between firms and three radical circles (i.e., Slow Food, Memphis, and the Free Software Foundation). Our case studies highlight that the firms captured value from collaborating with these radical circles through developing internal assets (reputational, organizational, intellectual and human, and technological) and new business models.

WoS,The innovative NDBA concrete safety barrier able to withstand two subsequent TB81 crash tests,"The new NDBA concrete road safety barrier is characterized by an innovative anchorage system based on two C steel profiles incorporated into the terminal sections of each module and a vertical HEM 100 steel profile inserted for linking the barrier modules. Every single barrier module is fixed in the body of the road embankment and pavement layers by six IPE 80 steel beams (three for each side with a mutual distance of 2 m), each 78 cm long. The IPE 80 steel beams are placed into niches, in the lower part of the barrier. The new barrier has been analysed first by numerical simulations (LS-DYNA software) and afterwards by full-scale crash tests. One TB11 (light vehicle) and two successive TB 81 (heavy vehicle) full-scale crash tests have been performed on NDBA barrier of 72 m length. The second TB81 test was performed on a damaged barrier previously subjected to impact without it being repaired. The experiments were conducted at CSI test centre in Bollate, Milan (Italy). According to the EN 1317 regulation, the results have shown a containment level CL = 725 kj (H4b class), a measured maximum ASI = 1.26 (class B), a working width W = 0.74 m (class W2). The research proves that the NDBA barrier is able to withstand two subsequent heavy vehicle (38 t) impacts. In addition, the study demonstrates that the new barrier may guarantee more safety for light vehicle occupants (TB11 test) than a conventional steel safety barrier with equal containment level (H4b class). Therefore, in the near future, NDBA barrier may be installed on existing roads, especially where reduced working width (W2) is required or in motorways with high AADT values and heavy vehicle percentage.",Road safety barriers; NDBA barrier; LS-DYNA; Full-scale crash test; EN 1317 regulation,"Dinnella, N; Chiappone, S; Guerrieri, M",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS,10.1016/j.engfailanal.2020.104660,"[Dinnella, Nicola; Chiappone, Sandro] ANAS SpA, Via Marsala 27, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Guerrieri, Marco] Univ Trento, DICAM, Via Mesiano 77, I-38123 Trento, Italy",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,1350-6307,
WoS,TETRA-EU 1.0: A species-level trophic metaweb of European tetrapods,"Motivation Documenting potential interactions between species represents a major step towards understanding and predicting the spatial and temporal structure of multi-trophic communities and their functioning. The metaweb concept summarizes the potential trophic (and non-trophic) interactions in a given species pool. As such, it generalizes the regional species pool of community ecology by incorporating the potential relationships between species from different trophic levels along with their functional characteristics. However, although this concept is very attractive theoretically, it has rarely been used to understand the structure of an ecological network, mostly because of data availability. Here, we provide a continental-scale, species-level metaweb for all tetrapods (mammals, breeding birds, reptiles and amphibians) occurring in Europe and in the Northern Mediterranean basin. This metaweb is based on data extracted from the scientific literature, including published papers, books and grey literature. Main type of variable contained For each species considered, we built the network of potential two-way trophic interactions. Spatial location and grain We considered all species occurring in the entire European subcontinent, from Macaronesia (including only the islands belonging politically to Spain and Portugal) to the Ural Mountains (west to east) and from Fennoscandia and U.K. islands to the Mediterranean (north to south). We included Turkey, geographically part of Asia, to provide a complete picture of the north-eastern Mediterranean coast. Time period The data represent information published and/or collected during the last 50 years. Major taxa studied and level of measurement We focused our metaweb on terrestrial tetrapods occurring in the study area.

WoS,Consumer expectations and experiences of quality in Australian home-based community services,"Australians want to live at home as they age and seek support from health and social care services to achieve this. The consumer driven market-based approach to community services in Australia has resulted in an increases in user's expectations of quality. What constitutes a quality service from the consumer's perspective is an important agenda to understand as the focus of care delivery moves to the domiciliary setting. This paper presents one aspect from a grounded theory PhD study, the aim of which was to understand the lived experience of receiving services in the home and its impact on the meaning of home. Participants were 11 people with dementia and 18 family supporters living in the state of Victoria, Australia. Data were collected between 2015 and 2017 through multiple interviews, photographic images, field notes and memos. NVIVO 10 qualitative analysis software program was used to support constant comparative analysis. Using a grounded theory approach, this study found that the decision to engage with community services was driven by the need to maintain autonomy, self-identity and home life. Participants sought quality services but discovered a dichotomy of positive and negative aspects in the way services were delivered. The most common reaction to the experience of poor-quality care was to reflect on their expectations for care quality; and manage the reality of what was delivered. Team work and service responsiveness were positive characteristics but were offset by service limitations and inefficiencies caused by poor communication and poor staff retention. The interpersonal relationships that participants developed with staff was highlighted; trust was an important factor whereas unreliable, task orientated and poorly trained staff would be rejected.

Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles published up to June 30, 2019. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results Nineteen studies with a total of 6827 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The experimental group received dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban; the control group received warfarin. The safety endpoints were bleeding complications; the efficacy endpoints were thromboembolic complications. Results were as follows: Patients with NOACs had a lower risk of overall bleeding complications (OR = 0.69, 95% CI (0.54, 0.87),P = 0.002), including major bleeding complications (OR = 0.52, 95% CI (0.32, 0.84),P = 0.007) and minor bleeding complications (OR = 0.73, 95% CI (0.56, 0.94),P = 0.02). There was no significant difference in thromboembolic complications between NOACs and warfarin after CA (OR = 0.39, 95% CI (0.14, 1.10),P = 0.08).

Increasing scientific literature is describing novel metabolites isolated from marine microbes with attractive pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anticancer. Aims: To reveal a background of the main marine microbial-derived products that have been isolated and characterized, including recent examples. The main mechanisms of action of these compounds in different models are also discussed. Methods: This research was structured based on a four phases design. 1) the identification of research questions, 2) selection of relevant studies, 3) filtering of studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 4) collection and organization of the data. For the web search, were used PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct and ProQuest. For the selection and classification of the papers was used PRISMA software. Results: A wide variety of marine microbial metabolites with important pharmacological properties have been discovered and characterized so far. The main sources of these compounds are marine actinomycetes, bacilli, fungi from Aspergillus and Penicillium genus, microalgae, and some marine symbiotic bacteria and fungi. Most of these metabolites exhibit cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities. Complex structural moieties, such as multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms, seem to be related to these properties. The mechanisms of action of most of these molecules target apoptosis-related proteins, enzymes, transcription factors, DNA binding proteins and some cell surface receptors. Conclusions: The marine environment offers an efficient and attractive way to obtain novel natural products.

Despite the limited number of chickpea cultivars in Mexico, there are no scientific reports on its molecular characterization and genetic variability and structure. Therefore, the present research was carried out to estimate the genetic variability of the main cultivars developed in Mexico, and others donated by International Centers (ICARDA and ICRISAT). With the analysis of ten SSR markers, a total of 51 alleles were obtained, with individual values ranging from 3 to 9 alleles per locus. The average value of PIC was estimated at 0.70, while the average value of Shannon's Information Index was 1.365, indicating the presence of a high level of genetic variability in the collection. The UPGMA and PCoA analysis showed the trend of separation of the Mexican genotypes from those of ICARDA and ICRISAT. The genetic distance was close (0.292) between the ICARDA and ICRISAT groups, while a greater distance (0.718) was obtained between the ICARDA and Mexican groups. In conclusion, the present work revealed that the most of the Mexican cultivars were grouped together and diverged from the other accessions revealing a distinct genetic nature. The accessions from ICARDA and ICRISAT did not strictly follow the grouping according to their geographical origins, maybe because the exchange of germplasm between research centers.",Chickpea; SSR markers; Genetic variability and structure,"Valadez-Moctezuma, E; Cabrera-Hidalgo, AD; Arreguin-Espinosa, R",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,10.1007/s13562-019-00532-0,"[Valadez-Moctezuma, Ernestina; de Jesus Cabrera-Hidalgo, Anselmo] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Lab Biol Mol, Dept Fitotecnia, Carr Mexico Texcoco Km 38-5, Chapingo 56230, Edo De Mexico, Mexico; [Arreguin-Espinosa, Roberto] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Quim Biomacromol, Inst Quim, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",SPRINGER INDIA,English,0971-7811,
WoS,The dominant model analysis ofSirt3genetic variants is associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in a Chinese Han population,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a complex infectious disease caused by the pathogenMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) which has coexisted with humanity since the Neolithic. Recent research indicated that SIRT3 plays a pivotal role in promoting the antimycobacterial response of mitochondria and autophagy during Mtb infection. A case-control study comprised 900 TB patients and 1534 healthy controls who were retrospectively enrolled to assess the association betweenSirt3gene polymorphisms and TB susceptibility. In total, five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs511744, rs3782118, rs7104764, rs536715 and rs28365927) were selected through database 1000 Genomes Project and offline software Haploview V4.2 and genotyped by a customized 2 x 48-Plex SNPscan (TM) Kit. Our results suggested that the minor allele genotypes (A carriers) of rs3782118 confers the decreased risk of TB susceptibility (p(Bonferroni) = 0.032), and a similar but more significant effect was observed under the dominant model analysis (OR 0.787, 95% CI 0.666-0.931,p(Bonferroni) = 0.026). Haplotype analysis showed that haplotype AGAAG (rs511744/rs3782118/rs7104764/rs536715/rs28365927) was associated with an increased risk of TB (p = 0.023, OR 1.159, 95% CI 1.019-1.317). In stratification analysis, we found that rs3782118 was associated with decreased risk of TB in female subgroup under the dominant model analysis (p(Bonferroni) = 0.016, OR 0.678, 95% CI 0.523-0.878). Moreover, functional annotations for three loci (rs7930823, rs3782116 and rs3782115) which are strongly linked to rs3782118 indicated that they may be responsible for the changes in some motifs. In conclusion, our study suggested that the SNP rs3782118 was associated with a lower susceptibility to TB, especially under the dominant model analysis and that the haplotype AGAAG (containing the major allele G of rs3782118) was associated with an increased risk of TB.

WoS,NCINM: organ dose calculator for patients undergoing nuclear medicine procedures,"Nuclear medicine is the second largest source of medical radiation exposure to the general population after computed tomography imaging. Informed decisions regarding the use of nuclear medicine procedures require a better understanding of the magnitude of radiation dose and associated health risks. However, existing model-based organ dose estimation tools rely on simplified human anatomy models or commercial programs. Therefore, we developed a publicly-available dose calculation tool based on more sophisticated human anatomy models. We calculated a comprehensive library of photon and electron specific absorbed fractions (SAF) for multiple combinations of source and target regions within a series of pediatric and adult computational human phantoms matching the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)'s reference data, combined with a Monte Carlo radiation transport code. Then, we derived a library of S values from these SAFs and the nuclear decay data from ICRP Publication 107. Finally, we created a graphical user interface, named National Cancer Institute Dosimetry System for Nuclear Medicine (NCINM), to facilitate the dosimetry process. Approximately 13 million S values were derived from 2 million SAFs computed in this work. Comprehensive comparisons were conducted at different steps of the dosimetry chain with data available in software OLINDA/EXM 1.0 and IDAC 2.1. For instance, median ratios of photon self-absorption SAFs available from OLINDA/EXM 1.0 and IDAC 2.1 to those calculated in this study were 1.3 (interquartile range = 1.1-1.6) and 1.0 (interquartile range = 0.98-1.0), respectively. SAF differences between NCINM and OLINDA/EXM 1.0 were explained by the large inter-phantom anatomical variability. Our results illustrate the importance of realistic human anatomy models for use in dosimetry software. More phantoms and radionuclides, as well as a biokinetic module, will soon be added. Applications of the NCINM program include computation of absorbed doses for use in radiation epidemiologic studies and patient dose monitoring in nuclear medicine.",nuclear medicine; Monte Carlo radiation transport; computational human phantoms; organ absorbed dose,"Villoing, D; Cuthbert, TA; Kitahara, CM; Lee, C",2020.0,Journal,BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS,10.1088/2057-1976/aba41e,"[Villoing, Daphnee; Cuthbert, Thomas A.; Kitahara, Cari M.; Lee, Choonsik] NCI, Div Canc Epidemiol & Genet, NIH, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Cuthbert, Thomas A.] Univ Texas Hlth San Antonio, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, San Antonio, TX USA",IOP PUBLISHING LTD,English,2057-1976,
WoS,NeuronSeg_BACH:Automated Neuron Segmentation Using B-Spline Based Active Contour and Hyperelastic Regularization,"The vast diversity in neuron cell morphology has led to an increase in automated algorithms which can accurately reconstruct neurons from microscopy images. The poor quality of brightfield and fluorescence microscopy images and the thin branch-like fibrous structure of neurons make the process of manual segmentation challenging. We propose a novel automatic neuron segmentation framework using a B-spline based active contour deformation model with hyperelastic regularization, and develop a MATLAB software tool named NeuronSeg_BACH. In NeuronSeg_BACH, initialization of the contour is done automatically by detecting cell body and neurites separately. This boundary-extraction based algorithm utilizes cubic B-splines to deform active contours to match the neuron cell surface accurately. Using adaptive local refinement, finer level deformation of the active contour is captured using truncated hierarchical B-splines in a multiresolution manner. By introducing hyperelastic regularization, we allow large nonlinear deformations of the active contours. Unlike other existing methods which represent boundaries as piecewise constant functions, we provide a more accurate and smooth representation of the neuron geometry. In the level set segmentation framework, the implicit level set function is defined using C2 continuous B-splines. Improved segmentation results are shown for 2D and 3D synthetic and microscopy images as compared to other methods.",Neuron morphology; image segmentation; active contour models; hyperelastic regularization; truncated hierarchical B-splines,"Pawar, A; Zhang, YJ",2020.0,Journal,COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS,10.4208/cicp.OA-2020-0025,"[Pawar, Aishwarya; Zhang, Yongjie Jessica] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",GLOBAL SCIENCE PRESS,English,1815-2406,
WoS,Design and analysis of a renewable energy power system for shale oil exploitation using hierarchical optimization,"The exploitation of shale oil resources has attracted the wide attention. Using traditional fossil fuel as power supply for shale oil in-situ electric heating mining has an impact on the environment. In this paper, we propose a renewable energy microgrid system as a power supply for in-situ heating mining system of shale oil. A hierarchical optimization model was developed to optimize the capacity allocation of the microgrid components, which employs HOMER to initial optimization, then an improved multiobjective particle swarm algorithm with the lowest the economic cost function and the annual load shortage rate index of the system is implemented. A hierarchical hybrid strategy game method is used to screen the generated Pareto set to meet the different preferences of decision-makers. The sensitivity analysis of system reserve capacity, wind resources, and wind turbine prices was carried out. The simulation results using data from a demonstration project in China verified that the proposed method optimized the use of renewable energy, reduced the operating costs and produced positive environmental benefits.

The most widely accepted indices, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Percentage People Dissatisfied (PPD), have been used in this study for evaluating thermal comfort of a small office room in Delhi. Various parameters influencing thermal comfort have been measured for two months and the observations have been used for assessing the PMV and PPD, which have then been compared with the simulation results from IDA ICE 4.7 Beta software, and found to be in agreement. Moreover, a comparison of the PMV values has been done with other indices such as Tropical Summer Index (TSI) and Corrected Effective Temperature (CET). Parametric study for the office room has also been performed to predict the shifts in the comfort levels by changing types and thicknesses of wall as well as roof insulations, provision of blinds, and types of window glazing, using which, the best possible solution to enhance the thermal environment of the office room has been proposed.

WoS,New Approach in Designing a Kinetic Window Shading Using Optimization Methods,"In the United States, commercial buildings consume 18% of the total primary energy, which is predicted to increase by 1.2% per year from 2006 to 2030 due to population and economic growth. Windows in commercial buildings are also responsible for 34% of commercial space conditioning energy use and 1.5% of total energy use in the United States. Therefore, controlling the heat gain and loss from windows in commercial buildings would save a significant amount of energy and subsequently reduce the carbon footprint. As the main function of shading is to moderate light rays, whether intercepting or allowing them to enter, having well-designed shading can improve building energy performance. However, shading should be designed carefully since decreasing the cooling load may result in increased heating load and vice versa. In addition, in designing window shading, achieving a balance between energy load reduction and light energy consumption is always challenging. This study proposes a new approach to designing kinetic exterior window shading for small commercial buildings, which changes the geometrical parameters of the exposed glazing area (EGA) of existing windows. To achieve this, first an optimization code was developed based on the hill climbing algorithm. The developed optimization code was then coupled with EnergyPlus software to determine the optimum area of the EGA, its optimum width to height ratio, and its optimum location in an existing window. To illustrate the application of the proposed shading and evaluate building energy performance a model was designed and presented in DesignBuilder software. The study showed the significant amount of energy saved by applying the proposed shading.

WoS,Effects of process history on the surface morphology of uranium ore concentrates extracted from ore,"The effects of process history on the particle morphology of uranium ore concentrates (UOC) synthesized from natural uranium ores were investigated. A purified UOC was extracted from a uranium-rich ore by sulfuric acid leaching and purified by two commercial solvent extraction processes: the Dapex process using di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (DEHPA), and the Amex process using Alamine degrees 336. The UOC from either route was precipitated from its respective strip solution by ammonia and calcined. Powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD) was used to confirm the crystallography of the UOC; while Rietveld refinement was performed for quantification of U oxide phase composition. Inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to quantify impurity concentrations of the calcined material. As expected, different impurities were present due to processing via the Dapex and Amex process. To further correlate the impurities to the process history, particle morphology was quantified from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs using the MAMA segmentation software.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: In the study, 64 patients with overt Cushing syndrome (CS), 59 patients with mild autonomous cortisol excess (MACE), and 64 patients with nonfunctioning adrenal tumors (NFAT) with evaluable CT scans were included. Patients with NFAT and MACE were BMI-matched with those with overt CS. Planar and volumetric analyses of CT scans were performed in DICOM images using OsiriX software. Results: The mean age was 56.6 +/- 1.01 years, and 123 patients (65.1%) were female. In the order of NFAT, MACE, and overt CS, the diameters and volumes of the adenoma increased, while limb widths and volumes of the contralateral adrenal gland decreased. Patients with MACE or overt CS were more likely to have osteoporosis than those with NFAT (P = 0.006), and patients with overt CS were more likely to experience a fragility fracture than those with NFAT or MACE (P = 0.002). Among radiologic features, the limb width of the contralateral adrenal gland correlated with the cortisol level after overnight dexamethasone suppression test (r = - 0.583, P < 0.001).

WoS,Using neural networks to represent von Mises plasticity with isotropic hardening,"Neural networks are universal function approximators that form the backbone of most modern machine learning based models. Starting from a conventional return-mapping scheme, the algorithmic description of von Mises plasticity with isotropic hardening is mathematically reformulated such that the relationship between the strain and stress histories may be modeled through a neural network function. In essence, the neural network provides an estimate of the instantaneous elasto-plastic tangent matrix as a function of the current stress and plastic work density. For plane stress conditions, it thus describes a non-linear mapping from R-4 to R-6. The neural network function is first developed for uniaxial stress conditions including loading histories with tension-compression reversal. Special attention is paid to the identification of the network architecture and artifacts related to overfitting. Furthermore, the performance of networks featuring the same number of total parameters, but different levels of non-linearity, is compared. It is found that a fully-connected feedforward network with five hidden layers and 15 neurons per layer can describe the plane stress plasticity problem with good accuracy. The results also show that a high density of training data (of the order of ten to hundred thousand points) is needed to obtain reasonable estimates for arbitrary loading paths with strains of up to 0.2. The final neural network model is implemented into finite element software through the user material subroutine interface. A simulation of a notched tension experiment is performed to demonstrate that the neural network model yields the same (heterogeneous) mechanical fields as a conventional J2 plasticity model. The present work demonstrates that it is feasible to describe the stress-strain response of a von Mises material through a neural network model without any explicit representation of the yield function, flow rule, hardening law or evolution constraints. It is emphasized that the demonstration of feasibility is the focus of the present work, while the assessment of potential computational advantages is deferred to future research.",J2 plasticity; Machine learning; Elasto-plastic tangent modulus; Return mapping,"Zhang, AN; Mohr, D",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY,10.1016/j.ijplas.2020.102732,"[Zhang, Annan; Mohr, Dirk] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Computat Modeling Mat Mfg, Zurich, Switzerland; [Zhang, Annan; Mohr, Dirk] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Impact & Crashworthiness Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0749-6419,

Further, they compared the performance of LPA against their proposed dynamic programming algorithm (DPA) and claimed that LPA is superior to DPA, in terms of scalability. In this paper, we show that theirlinear programming problem does not correctly capture the execution requirement of real-time tasks on heterogeneous platforms. Consequently, LPA fails to produce valid execution schedules for most task sets presented to it. We first illustrate this flaw and strengthen our claim theoretically using a counterexample.

This research work presents a methodological frame, which aims to three issues: (a) to explain the nature of low robustness of the estimated preference models, utilising tomographical techniques, visual tools, and specific indices for the robustness measurement, (b) to support the Decision Makers (DMs) towards a deeper understanding of his/her value system, and (c) to acquire additional preference information by the DM estimating a value functions of higher robustness through focused interactive feedbacks. The main scope of this research work is to exploit and enrich the interactive nature of the multicriteria disaggregation-aggregation approach.

WoS,"Thermal stability characteristics of high-power, large-capacity, reserve thermal batteries with pure Li and Li(Si) anodes","High-power, large-capacity reserve thermal batteries are useful power sources for the actuators of guided weapons and propulsion for the underwater vehicles. However, unexpected thermal runaway and explosions can occur due to the thermal design error. Preventing such accidents is crucial and arduous challenge in developing high capacity, reliable thermal batteries. To do so, the heat balance between the heat source and the electrode/solid-electrolyte components must be carefully considered when designing a thermal battery. Herein, the optimal discharge temperatures and heat balances of thermal batteries are obtained through the discharge experiment of unit cells with Li(Si) and pure-Li anodes (LAN): (Li(Si): 500 degrees C/100 cal g(-1), LAN: 550 degrees C/110 cal g(-1)). The thermal properties of two types of thermal batteries (150 V, 80 cells, 1 kWh) with Li(Si) and LAN are also analyzed using COMSOL Multiphysics software. Furthermore, to compare the performance, two high-power, large-capacity thermal batteries with the same heat-source energy (110 cal g(-1)) are fabricated and discharged at 40 A over 600 s. The experimentally evaluated temperatures of the cathodes, electrolytes, heat sources, and other components are found to be consistent with the simulation results suggesting that this study provides a complete and accurate computational methods to design high capacity thermal batteries.

WoS,An accurate determination method for constitutive model of anisotropic tubular materials with DIC-based controlled biaxial tensile test,"The reliability of numerical simulation results vitally depends on the accurate determination of the constitutive model, which requires accurate and sufficient experimental data. To address the current limitations of the range and accuracy of the experimental data of tubular materials, a novel controlled biaxial tensile testing device was developed using digital image correlation (DIC) system as the deformation measuring tool. Using such a device, arbitrary biaxial tensile stress path can be accurately applied to tubular specimens, and the strain can be accurately and continuously measured over the whole deformation process. Firstly, the accurate experimental data of AA6061-O tubes were obtained through the controlled biaxial tensile tests. Then, using the experimental data, the constitutive model considering the evolution of anisotropic characteristics was calibrated based on the Yld2000-2d yield criterion. Finally, the accuracy of the calibrated constitutive model was verified in engineering practices by compiling the constitutive model into finite element software as a user material subroutine (VUMAT) for simulating tube hydro-bulging. Excellent agreements were achieved between experimentally-determined and predicted bulge height, bulge profile, and pole thickness of bulged tubes over the whole hydro-bulging process. It is demonstrated that the DIC-based controlled biaxial tensile test is effective to accurately calibrate the constitutive model of tubular materials, which can be used for both the research of plastic deformation behavior and practical application of hydroforming industry.",Anisotropic tubular material; Constitutive model; Biaxial tensile test; Digital image correlation; Hydro-bulging; FEA,"He, ZB; Zhang, K; Lin, YL; Yuan, SJ",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES,10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.105715,"[He, Zhubin; Zhang, Kun; Yuan, Shijian] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [He, Zhubin; Lin, Yanli; Yuan, Shijian] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0020-7403,
WoS,Plastome phylogeography in two African rain forest legume trees reveals that Dahomey Gap populations originate from the Cameroon volcanic line,"Paleo-environmental data show that the distribution of African rain forests was affected by Quaternary climate changes. In particular, the Dahomey Gap (DG) - a 200 km wide savanna corridor currently separating the West African and Central African rain forest blocks and containing relict rain forest fragments - was forested during the mid-Holocene and possibly during previous interglacial periods, whereas it was dominated by open vege-tation (savanna) during glacial periods. Genetic signatures of past population fragmentation and demographic changes have been found in some African forest plant species using nuclear markers, but such events appear not to have been synchronous or shared across species. To better understand the colonization history of the DG by rain forest trees through seed dispersal, the plastid genomes of two widespread African forest legume trees, Anthonotha macrophylla and Distemonanthus benthamianus, were sequenced in 47 individuals for each species, providing unprecedented phylogenetic resolution of their maternal lineages (857 and 115 SNPs, respectively). Both species exhibit distinct lineages separating three regions: 1. Upper Guinea (UG, i.e. the West African forest block), 2. the area ranging from the DG to the Cameroon volcanic line (CVL), and 3. Lower Guinea (LG, the western part of the Central African forest block) where three lineages co-occur. In both species, the DG popu-lations (including southern Nigeria west of Cross River) exhibit much lower genetic diversity than UG and LG populations, and their plastid lineages originate from the CVL, confirming the role of the CVL as an ancient forest refuge. Despite the similar phylogeographic structures displayed by A. macrophylla and D. benthamianus, mo-lecular dating indicates very contrasting ages of lineage divergence (UG diverged from LG since c. 7 Ma and 0.7 Ma, respectively) and DG colonization (probably following the Mid Pleistocene Transition and the Last Glacial Maximum, respectively). The stability of forest refuge areas and repeated similar forest shrinking/ex-panding events during successive glacial periods might explain why similar phylogeographic patterns can be generated over contrasting timescales.",African rain forest; Cameroon volcanic line; Colonization origin; Dahomey gap; Phylogeography; Plastid genome sequencing,"Demenou, BB; Migliore, J; Heuertz, M; Monthe, FK; Ojeda, DI; Wieringa, JJ; Dauby, G; Albreht, L; Boom, A; Hardy, OJ",2020.0,Journal,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106854,"[Demenou, Boris B.; Migliore, Jeremy; Monthe, Franck K.; Ojeda, Dario, I; Dauby, Gilles; Albreht, Laura; Boom, Arthur; Hardy, Olivier J.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Fac Sci, Evolut Biol & Ecol, CP160-12,Av FD Roosevelt 50, BE-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Heuertz, Myriam] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, BIOGECO, F-33610 Cestas, France; [Ojeda, Dario, I] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Hogskoleveien 8, N-1433 As, Norway; [Wieringa, Jan J.] Natl Herbarium Netherlands, Nat Biodivers Ctr, Darwinweg 2, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Wieringa, Jan J.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Biosystemat Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Dauby, Gilles] Univ Montpellier, AMAP Lab, INRA, CNRS,IRD, Montpellier, France",ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,English,1055-7903,
WoS,"Mitogenomics reveals phylogenetic relationships of Arcoida (Mollusca, Bivalvia) and multiple independent expansions and contractions in mitochondrial genome size","Arcoida, comprising about 570 species of blood cockles, is an ecologically and economically important lineage of bivalve molluscs. Current classification of arcoids is largely based on morphology, which shows widespread homoplasy. Despite two recent studies employing multi-locus analyses with broad sampling of Arcoida, evolu-tionary relationships among major lineages remain controversial. Interestingly, mitochondrial genomes of sev-eral ark shell species are 2-3 times larger than those found in most bilaterians, and are among the largest bilaterian mitochondrial genomes reported to date. These results highlight the need of detailed phylogenetic study to explore evolutionary relationships within Arcoida so that the evolution of mitochondrial genome size can be understood. To this end, we sequenced 17 mitochondrial genomes and compared them with publicly available data, including those from other lineages of Arcoida with emphasis on the subclade Arcoidea species. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that Noetiidae, Cucullaeidae and Glycymerididae are nested within a polyphyletic Arcidae. Moreover, we find multiple independent expansions and potential contractions of mi-tochondrial genome size, suggesting that the large mitochondrial genome is not a shared ancestral feature in Arcoida. We also examined tandem repeats and inverted repeats in non-coding regions and investigated the presence of such repeats with relation to genome size variation. Our results suggest that tandem repeats might facilitate intraspecific mitochondrial genome size variation, and that inverted repeats, which could be derived from transposons, might be responsible for mitochondrial genome expansions and contractions. We show that mitochondrial genome size in Arcoida is more dynamic than previously understood and provide insights into evolution of mitochondrial genome size variation in metazoans.",Genome size; Mitogenome; Tandem repeats; Inverted repeats,"Kong, LF; Li, YN; Kocot, KM; Yang, Y; Qi, L; Li, Q; Halanych, KM",2020.0,Journal,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106857,"[Kong, Lingfeng; Yang, Yi; Qi, Lu; Li, Qi] Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Mariculture, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Kong, Lingfeng; Li, Qi] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food Prod Proc, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Li, Yuanning; Halanych, Kenneth M.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Li, Yuanning; Halanych, Kenneth M.] Auburn Univ, Molette Biol Lab Environm & Climate Change Studie, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Li, Yuanning] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kocot, Kevin M.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Kocot, Kevin M.] Univ Alabama, Alabama Museum Nat Hist, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,English,1055-7903,

The wall with PCM was exposed to constant heat flux, whereas the opposite vertical wall was kept at a constant temperature. For the theoretical study, a model for heat transfer was proposed and solved using computational fluid dynamics software. The enthalpy method was used to simulate the phase change in the PCM. For the experimental study, five temperature profiles were obtained for air, one for PCM, and at different points of shared wall between PCM and air. A comparison was made, between, experimental and numerical data, to determine the predictive capacity of the model. Besides, numerical results of the liquid fraction in the PCM were compared with data reported in the specialized literature. It was found that the enthalpy method was adequate to study proposed in this study. The numerical temperature fields and flow patterns in the air were analyzed, as well as the evolution of the liquid fraction in the PCM. With the validated model, a parametric study was conducted to quantify the effect of Rayleigh number and PCM thickness on Nusselt number and the average air temperature. It was found that the use of the PCM decreased the heat transfer to the air.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 male and female undergraduate students (aged 19-23 years), exploring how the gendering of alcoholic beverages facilitates men's perpetration of sexual violence against women in a Nigerian university. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo 10 software. Men were found to exclude women from consuming beer, which they described as inappropriate feminine behavior, confining them to drinking sweetened/flavored alcoholic beverages. To maintain a notion of respectable femininity, women consumed these drinks, but this created gender-specific risks. In comparison with beer, sweetened alcoholic beverages have a higher alcohol content, which many of the men were aware of, unlike the women interviewed. Some men admitted buying such drinks for women, pressuring them to drink above their limits and raping them when they were inebriated.

Features of the coarse-grained structure of Fe-Cr-C based coatings leads to intensive abrasive wear. The aim of this study was to increase a durability of that equipment by using of flux cored electrodes with reaction components of Ti, Cr, Mo, B4C and their combinations to provide synthesis, which leads to finegrained structure of refractory borides and carbides and their solid solutions with increased hardness. Structure of the hardfacing coatings were investigated by method of metallography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (BSD) mode and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Temperature dependences of equilibrium phase amount of the hardfacing materials were calculated by the CALPHAD technique, using JMatPro software. It was investigated that the offered materials are characterized by higher wear resistance at high specific and cyclic loads in comparison with serial production high-chromium hardfacing materials (Lastek, ESAB, Paton IEW). It was established that the abrasion wear resistance at high specific and cyclic loads depends mostly of formation of the structure of hardfacing material, and not the hardness.

The development and evaluation of the unaided, GNSS-based precise positioning system is a key milestone toward the overall goal of combining precise GNSS, vision, radar, and inertial sensing for all-weather, high-integrity, high-absolute-accuracy positioning for automated and connected vehicles. The system described and evaluated herein is composed of a densely spaced reference network, a software-defined GNSS receiver, and a real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning engine. A performance- sensitivity analysis reveals that navigation data wipeoff for fully modulated GNSS signals and a dense reference network are key to high-performance urban RTK positioning. A comparison with existing unaided systems for urban GNSS processing indicates that the proposed system has significantly greater availability or accuracy.",Global navigation satellite system; Receivers; Sensors; Global Positioning System; Urban areas; Buildings; Couplings,"Humphreys, TE; Murrian, MJ; Narula, L",2020.0,Journal,IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE,10.1109/MITS.2020.2994121,"[Humphreys, Todd E.; Murrian, Matthew J.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Aerosp Engn & Engn Mech, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Narula, Lakshay] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,1939-1390,
WoS,Development of an Affordable and High-Fidelity Flight Simulation Training Device,"Flight simulation training device (FSTD) is considered one of the most useful equipment for pilot training and flight skill evaluation. However, high-level FSTDs are very expensive in the commercial market due to the complexity of the system integration and the customization for each aircraft model. In this paper, a solution to develop an affordable and high-fidelity FSTD is proposed. An FSTD of Beech 1900C regional aircraft has been accomplished. The development process, system configuration and component design of the Beech FSTD are presented. This FSTD consists of a duplicated cockpit and a computational platform. The duplicated cockpit contains a side-by-side dual-pilot flight control deck. Well-designed instruments, control panels, force-feedback flight control system and engine power control system together with a 3-channel direct-project visual cueing system and an audio cueing system are integrated in this cockpit. The computational platform is equipped with a set of personal computers (PCs), which is used to construct a computational cluster. In this PC-based cluster. a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) simulation software, named X-Planc, and the interface software and firmware are adopted to drive the cockpit hardware to establish the simulation environment. The system architecture and integration method of this Beech FSTD are described. The system simulation result and performance validation are also presented to demonstrate the feasible design of this affordable and high-fidelity FSTD.",Flight Simulation; Pilot Training; System Integration,"Wu, LN",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS ASTRONAUTICS AND AVIATION,10.6125/JoAAA.202009_52(3).08,"[Wu, Lung-Nan] ROC Air Force Acad, Dept Avion Engn, Kaohsiung 82047, Taiwan",AERONAUTICAL & ASTRONAUTICAL SOC REPUBLIC CHINA,English,1990-7710,
WoS,Ref: NET_2019_1563: Working while studying: The impact of term-time employment on undergraduate nursing students' engagement in the Republic of Ireland: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Globally, there is evidence that tertiary education students are increasingly combining full time study with paid term-time employment. Despite this dual participation, little is known about the impact of working for pay during term on students' engagement with activities, both academic and social, that are associated with learning and development. Objectives: To measure undergraduate nursing students' term-time employment commitments and the impact of those commitments on nursing students' engagement. Design: Cross-sectional survey design. Settings: Four Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Republic of Ireland - comprising of two Universities and two Institutes of Technology. Participants: First and final year undergraduate students (n = 634) enrolled in a four-year Bachelor of Science Nursing (honours degree). Methods: The College Student Report - National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) self-report questionnaire was utilised. This collects data on core activities associated with student engagement along with how students spend their time in and out of class. The statistical software package SPSS version 21 was used to analyse data. Results: Over two-thirds of undergraduate nursing students (n = 423) engaged in term-time employment, working on average 15 h per week, with non-traditional students (i.e. mature-aged, those with children, those who did not enter college based on second level school results) working most hours. Term-time employment had limited impact on student engagement, however, students in employment had increased student faculty interaction compared to students who were not employed but engaged in less time studying (Mean = 7.2, SD 5.9) than those who were employed (Mean = 8.7, SD = 7.6; t(316) = 2.46; p=.014). Conclusions: Overall, engaging in term-time employment was not negatively associated with student engagement, but it did reduce the number of hours students studied. Non-traditional students were more likely to be employed and consequently impacted by combining work and educational demands.",,"Clynes, M; Sheridan, A; Frazer, K",2020.0,Journal,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104513,"[Clynes, Mary] Dublin City Univ, Sch Nursing Psychotherapy & Community Hlth, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Sheridan, Ann; Frazer, Kate] Univ Coll Dublin, Hlth, Sch Nursing Midwifery & Hlth Syst, Dublin 4, Ireland",CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,English,0260-6917,
WoS,Coupled Lamb waves propagation along the direction of non-principal symmetry axes in pre-stressed anisotropic composite lamina,"Based on the linear three-dimensional elastic theory and the mechanics theory of incremental deformation, using the Legendre orthogonal polynomial expansion (LOPE) method, the wave equations of Lamb wave propagation in the non-principal symmetry axes direction of anisotropic composite lamina was firstly derived when the initial stresses were applied in the horizontal and vertical directions. Subsequently, the coupled equations of Lamb wave propagation were numerically solved. In order to verify the accuracy of the process, the dispersion curves of phase velocity in an isotropic aluminum plate and anisotropic composite lamina without loaded initial stresses were beforehand calculated by LOPE method to compare with those obtained from the commercial software of DISPERSE (R) and available data. Then, a series of cases referring to unidirectional fiber reinforced composite lamina were further implemented to study the effects of horizontal initial stress and vertical initial stress on the fundamental Lamb wave modes. The results show that the phase velocity of the A(0) mode is more sensitive to the implementation of initial stresses compared with the S-0 mode and SH0 mode. Finally, the effect of fiber orientation was illustrated in details. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,On the stability of nucleic acid feedback control systems,"Recent work has shown how chemical reaction network theory may be used to design dynamical systems that can be implemented biologically in nucleic acid-based chemistry. While this has allowed the construction of advanced open-loop circuitry based on cascaded DNA strand displacement (DSD) reactions, little progress has so far been made in developing the requisite theoretical machinery to inform the systematic design of feedback controllers in this context. Here, we develop a number of foundational theoretical results on the equilibria, stability, and dynamics of nucleic acid controllers. In particular, we show that the implementation of feedback controllers using DSD reactions introduces additional nonlinear dynamics, even in the case of purely linear designs, e.g. PI controllers. By decomposing the effects of these non-observable nonlinear dynamics, we show that, in general, the stability of the linear system design does not necessarily imply the stability of the underlying chemical reaction network, which can be lost under experimental variability when feedback interconnections are introduced. We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, and present an example to illustrate when the linear design does not capture the instability of the full nonlinear system implemented as a DSD reaction network, and we further confirm these results using Visual DSD, a bespoke software tool for simulating nucleic acid-based circuits. Our analysis highlights the many interesting and unique characteristics of this important new class of feedback control systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Impacts of climate change on the optimum planting date of different maize cultivars in the central US Corn Belt,"Planting date and cultivar selection are major factors in determining the yield potential of any crop and in any region. However, there is a knowledge gap in how climate scenarios affect these choices. To explore this gap, we performed a regional scale analysis (11 planting dates x 8 cultivars x 281 fields x 36 weather years x 6 climate scenarios) using the APSIM model and pSIMS software for Iowa, the leading US maize (Zea mays L.) producing state. Our objectives were to determine how the optimum planting date (optPD)changes with weather scenarios and cultivars and the potential economic implications of planting outside the optimum windows. Results indicated that the mean optPD corresponds to the US Department of Agriculture, National Agriculture Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) 18.4% planting progress (April 28th) in Iowa. The opt optPD was found to be advancing by -0.13 d yr(-1) from 1980 to 2015. A 1 degrees C increase in mean temperature increased the length of the growing season by 10 days while the opt PD changed by -2 to + 6 days, depending on cultivar. Under a more realistic scenario of increasing the minimum temperature by 0.5 degrees C, decreasing the maximum temperature by 0.5 degrees C, increasing spring rainfall by 10% and decreasing summer rainfall by 10%, the optPD only changed by -2 days compared to current trends, however, yield increased by 6.6%. Analysis of historical USDA-NASS planting durations indicated that on average, the planting duration (1-99% statewide reported planting progress) is 44 days, while it can be as low as 21 days in years with favorable weather. A simple economic analysis illustrated a potential revenue loss up to $340 million per year by planting maize outside the optimum window. We conclude that future investments in planting technologies to accelerate planting, especially in challenging weather years, as well as improved optPD x cultivar recommendations to farmers, will provide economic benefits and buffer climate variability.",Planting date; Maize cultivars; Climate change; Frost free period; Modeling; APSIM,"Baum, ME; Licht, MA; Huber, I; Archontoulis, SV",2020.0,Journal,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY,10.1016/j.eja.2020.126101,"[Baum, Mitch E.; Licht, Mark A.; Huber, Isaiah; Archontoulis, Sotirios, V] Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Agron Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA",ELSEVIER,English,1161-0301,
WoS,GES-CAL: A new computer program for the design of closed-loop geothermal energy systems,"The purpose of this paper is to present a new tool developed for the calculation and design of shallow closed-loop geothermal systems. Most of the available geothermal computer programs only allow to consider vertical heat exchangers configurations (i.e. single or double-U tubes), being the horizontal and helical designs excluded. As an attempt to fill this gap, GES-CAL tool, presented here, is capable of providing the complete design of all the most common configurations used in low enthalpy geothermal systems. This software was initially developed for its implementation in the region of Avila (Spain), including the most relevant results of previous author's researches in this area. Throughout this work, the new software is deeply described and implemented in the calculation of three different study cases. Results of GES-CAL are complementary compared with the ones obtained from the most used geothermal software, EED (Earth Energy Designer). From the analysis of these results, it was possible to conclude that GES-CAL tool constitutes an optimal solution for planning a shallow geothermal system, but especially for those installations placed in the region of Avila. In this area, the well field can be designed in more precise way which results in lower drilling lengths and, hence, lower initial investments. The conclusions of this work indicate that GES-CAL offers remarkable advantages such as the automatic calculation of the space energy demand, the inclusion of all the heat exchanger configurations and an economic and environmental evaluation of the final geothermal solution.",Computer program; Sizing tools; GES-CAL; Shallow geothermal systems; EED; Heat exchangers; Software development,"Blaquez, CS; Nieto, IM; Mora, R; Martin, AF; Gonzalez-Aguilera, D",2020.0,Journal,GEOTHERMICS,10.1016/j.geothermics.2020.101852,"[Saez Blaquez, Cristina; Martin Nieto, Ignacio; Mora, Rocio; Farfan Martin, Arturo; Gonzalez-Aguilera, Diego] Univ Salamanca, Higher Polytech Sch Avila, Dept Cartog & Terrain Engn, Hornos Caleros 50, Avila 05003, Spain",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0375-6505,
WoS,A Novel High-Frequency PLL Design for wireless applications,"Nowadays, there are growing trends of advances in wireless devices and becoming common in every household and workplace. The increasing desire for these devices is to create smaller, fast, and low power applications. The growing need in today's wireless applications is increasing requirements for identification of a high-speed low noise, low power novel Phase-locked loop (PLL) design. The PLL feedback loop can be found in nearly all aspects of wireless communication, these include radio, TV, cell phones, PDAs, pagers, wireless transmitters and receivers, etc. Phase-locked loop (PLL) is a feedback control system that generates an output signal whose frequency and phase depends on the phase of the input signal, the main PLL building blocks are; Phase Frequency Detector (PFD), Charge Pump (CP), Loop Filter (LF), Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO), and Frequency Divider (FD). This paper addresses a wide tuning range 2.4-5.0 GHz, novel high-frequency PLL design for wireless applications. The theoretical model and PLL analysis are principally described in the theoretical part. While, in the practical part, the design choices of various blocks, design calculation and simulation for final solutions are presented.

WoS,Designing a multi-epitope vaccine against blood-stage of Plasmodium falciparum by in silico approaches,"Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria disease and is the major cause of infection-related mortalities in the world. Due to increasing in P. falciparum resistance to the first-line antimalarial drugs, an effective vaccine for the control and elimination of malaria infection is urgent. Because the pathogenesis of malaria disease results from blood-stage infection, and all of the symptoms and clinical illness of malaria occur during this stage, there is a strong rationale to develop vaccine against this stage. In the present study, different structural-vaccinology and immuno informatics tools were applied to design an effective antibody-inducing multi-epitope vaccine against the blood-stage of P. falciparum. The designed multi-epitope vaccine was composed of three main parts including B cell epitopes, T helper (Th) cell epitopes, and two adjuvant motives (HP91 and RS09), which were linked to each other via proper linkers. B cell and T cell epitopes were derived from four protective antigens expressed on the surface of merozoites, which are critical to invade the erythrocytes. HP91 and RS09 adjuvants and Th cell epitopes were used to induce, enhance and direct the best form of humoral immune-response against P. falciparum surface merozoite antigens. The vaccine construct was modeled, and after model quality evaluation and refinement by different software, the high-quality 3D-structure model of the vaccine was achieved. Analysis of immunological and physicochemical features of the vaccine showed acceptable results. We believe that this multi-epitope vaccine can be effective for preventing malaria disease caused by P. falciparum. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,DNA sequence similarity analysis using image texture analysis based on first-order statistics,"Similarity is one of the key processes of DNA sequence analysis in computational biology and bioinformatics. In nearly all research that explores evolutionary relationships, gene function analysis, protein structure prediction and sequence retrieving, it is necessary to perform similarity calculations. One major task in alignment-free DNA sequence similarity calculations is to develop novel mathematical descriptors for DNA sequences. In this paper, we present a novel approach to DNA sequence similarity analysis studies using similarity calculations of texture images. Texture analysis methods, which are a subset of digital image processing methods, are used here with the assumption that these calculations can be adapted to alignment-free DNA sequence similarity analysis methods. Gray-level textures were created by the values assigned to the nucleotides in the DNA sequences. Similarity calculations were made between these textures using histogram-based texture analyses based on first-order statistics. We obtained texture features for 3 different DNA data sets of different lengths, and calculated the similarity matrices. The phylogenetic relationships revealed by our method shows our trees to be similar to the results of the MEGA software, which is based on sequence alignment. Our findings show that texture analysis metrics can be used to characterize DNA sequences. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,The road to BOFUSS: The basic OpenFlow userspace software switch,"Software switches are pivotal in the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, particularly in the early phases of development, deployment and testing. Currently, the most popular one is Open vSwitch (OVS), lever-aged in many production-based environments. However, due to its kernel-based nature, OVS is typically complex to modify when additional features or adaptation is required. To this regard, a simpler user-space is key to perform these modifications. In this article, we present a rich overview of BOFUSS, the basic OpenFlow user-space software switch. BOFUSS has been widely used in the research community for diverse reasons, but it lacked a proper reference document. For this purpose, we describe the switch, its history, architecture, uses cases and evaluation, together with a survey of works that leverage this switch. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the switch and its characteristics. Although the original BOFUSS is not expected to surpass the high performance of OVS, it is a useful complementary artefact that provides some OpenFlow features missing in OVS and it can be easily modified for extended functionality. Moreover, enhancements provided by the BEBA project brought the performance from BOFUSS close to OVS. In any case, this paper sheds light to researchers looking for the trade-offs between performance and customization of BOFUSS.",Software-defined networking; Software switches; OpenFlow; Open source; Data plane programmability,"Fernandes, EL; Rojas, E; Alvarez-Horcajo, J; Kis, ZL; Sanvito, D; Bonelli, N; Cascone, C; Rothenberg, CE",2020.0,Review,JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS,10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102685,"[Fernandes, Eder Leao] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England; [Rojas, Elisa; Alvarez-Horcajo, Joaquin] Univ Alcala De Henares, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Kis, Zoltan Lajos] Ericsson, Budapest, Hungary; [Sanvito, Davide] Politecn Milan, Milan, Italy; [Bonelli, Nicola] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy; [Cascone, Carmelo] Open Networking Fdn, USA, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Rothenberg, Christian Esteve] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, INTRIG, Campinas, Brazil",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,1084-8045,
WoS,Chatbots in retailers' customer communication: How to measure their acceptance?,"Currently, online retailers evaluate whether chatbots-software programs that interact with users using natural languages-could improve their customers' satisfaction. In a retail context, chatbots allow humans to pose shopping-related questions and receive answers in natural language without waiting for a salesperson or using other automated communication forms. However, until now, it has been unclear which customers accept this new communication form and which factors determine their acceptance. In this paper, we contrast the well-known technology acceptance model (TAM) with the lesser known uses and gratifications (U&G) theory, applying both approaches to measure the acceptance of the text-based Emma chatbot by its target segment. Emma was developed for the prepurchase phase of online fashion retailing and integrated into Facebook Messenger by the major German online retailer Zalando. Data were collected from 205 German Millennial respondents in a usability study. The results show that both utilitarian factors such as authenticity of conversation and perceived usefulness, as well as hedonic factors such as perceived enjoyment, positively influence the acceptance of Emma. However, privacy concerns and the immaturity of the technology had a negative effect on usage intention and frequency. The predictive power of both models was similar, showing little deviation, but U&G gives alternative insights into the customers' motivation to use Emma compared to the TAM.",,"Rese, A; Ganster, L; Baier, D",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES,10.1016/j.jretconser.2020.102176,"[Rese, Alexandra; Ganster, Lena; Baier, Daniel] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0969-6989,

Considering the structural differences between primary and permanent teeth, this study aimed to compare the microhardness of early enamel lesions of deciduous teeth, treated with an infiltrant resin, a fluoride varnish and GC Tooth Mousse. Materials and Methods: Thirty six intact primary canines were included in the present in-vitro study. They were immersed in a demineralizing solution and incubated at 37 degrees C for 4 days. The samples were randomly assigned into three study groups (rein infiltrate (group 1), GC Tooth Mousse (group 2) and fluoride varnish (group 3); 12 samples within each) and differently treated. Microhardness was evaluated before and after the remineralization process and after treatments for each specimen using a Vickers hardness testing machine. Data analysis was performed using paired T test on SPSS v22 software. Results: In group 2, the microhardness coefficient was increased significantly (P=0.04) from 133.3 to 155.4 (+22.1 V). The microhardness coefficient for group 1 was increased, but not significantly, (P=0.2) from 139.7 to 152.4. In group 3, the microhardness coefficient was significantly (P= 0.001) increased from 138.6 to 178.3 (+39.7 V).

In fact, diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The management of high lipid levels in diabetes is a key aspect within the multifactorial technique to save CVD in people with type 2 diabetes. Several meta-analysis studies have in reality validated effects of statin remedy. Aims: To look into the adherence of simvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: A descriptive case looking at 1680 diabetic patients conducted in Hera General Hospital. Data were retrieved from clinical files from January 2018 until December 2018. Data evaluation performed using the SPSS software. Results: Almost 95 percent of the population around was older than 45 years. Almost all patients (97%) were on statin therapy. Treatment goal for an LDL less than 2.5 mmol/l was found in (20%) patients. Diabetic men were more likely than diabetic women to receive a statin prescription (P <0.05). Conclusion: Data from 2018 showed that diabetic HGH patients showed only a small proportion of patients with diabetes have met the LDL treatment goal this was mainly because of poor adherence.

Methods The available literature was searched for eligible studies up to November 2019. The meta-analysis was performed by the RevMan 5.3 software. Results This meta-analysis involved nineteen studies. The rates of early and late complications in RYGB were much higher than those in SG. More specifically, within 30 days after surgeries, leak, urinary tract infection, obstruction, and death occurred more often in the RYGB group. The above differences may lead to higher rates of hospital readmission and return to the operating room. RYGB was superior to SG in terms of remission of hypertension and the 1-year follow-up weight loss outcome, while there were no differences in terms of remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as well as weight loss outcomes during 2- and 3-year follow-up.

WoS,Earthquake response of monopiles and caissons for Offshore Wind Turbines founded in liquefiable soil,"Monopile has been the most widespread foundation type for Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs) in shallow waters. Caisson (skirted) foundations have also been evaluated in some projects as an economical alternative. While the main concern in design of offshore foundations has been the environmental loads, the recent growth in construction of OWTs in seismic regions with the possibility of soil liquefaction has necessitated evaluation of the impact of earthquake and liquefaction from strong shakings on these structures. Several studies have reported the consequences of soil liquefaction for buildings and onshore structures; However, the effects of liquefaction on offshore foundations have not been sufficiently studied. This paper investigates the use of advanced liquefaction modeling in assessment of the response of monopiles and caissons for offshore wind turbines. The software FLAC3D and the SANISAND constitutive model are used to conduct the nonlinear dynamic analyses for OWTs. Excess pore water pressure during earthquake shaking and earthquake-induced displacements are computed at various points in the soil medium around the considered monopile and caisson foundations. The analyses reveal that SANISAND model is capable of simulating the pore pressure generation in the free-field as observed in a recent centrifuge test. The numerical results also indicate that both monopile and caissons in liquefiable soil deposits experience considerable rotations under the combined action of wind loads and earthquake shaking when liquefaction occurs.",Liquefaction; Monopile; Caisson foundation; Seismic analysis; SANISAND constitutive Model; Offshore wind,"Esfeh, PK; Kaynia, AM",2020.0,Journal,SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.soildyn.2020.106213,"[Esfeh, Pourya Kazemi] Univ Bologna UNIBO, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Bologna, Italy; [Kaynia, Amir M.] Norwegian Geotech Inst NGI, Oslo, Norway; [Kaynia, Amir M.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Trondheim, Norway",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0267-7261,
WoS,"Seismic vulnerability assessment and loss estimation in Cephalonia and Ithaca islands, Greece, due to earthquake events: A case study","In this paper an estimation of seismic losses for various seismic scenarios of the Cephalonia and Ithaca islands, Greece, is proposed. The area under consideration is located in one of the most seismically active regions with the most damage and human casualties in recent history. Seismic losses were estimated at buildings, economic and human level. The estimation method is based on the assumption that seismic risk depends on vulnerability and seismic hazard. Vulnerability estimation was done by detailed fragility curves representing the structures in the area. Subsequently, losses in the wider area were estimated for various seismic risk scenarios. Parametric scenarios for different earthquake level and retrofit strategy were performed. The earthquake loss estimation software ELER (Earthquake Loss Estimation Routine) was used for the calculations. The numerical results extracted and their comparison with results from actual earthquake loss showed that losses can be estimated in the same order of magnitude as the real data and thus enable the state to be better prepared to deal with future earthquakes more effectively.",Seismic losses; Vulnerability; Fragility curve; Earthquake causalities; Seismic hazard; Seismic risk,"Pnevmatikos, N; Konstandakopoulou, F; Koumoutsos, N",2020.0,Journal,SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.soildyn.2020.106252,"[Pnevmatikos, Nikos] Univ West Attica, Sch Mech, Dept Civil Engn, GR-26335 Egaleo, Greece; [Konstandakopoulou, Foteini; Koumoutsos, Nikos] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, GR-26335 Patras, Greece",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0267-7261,
WoS,The Association Between Two Common Polymorphisms and Cancer Susceptibility: A Meta-Analysis,"Background: Most studies revealed that microRNAs could play important roles in the development of various types of cancers. However, the findings remain inconsistent and controversial. To get more accurate results about the association of miR-26a-1 rs7372209 and miR-423 rs6505162 polymorphisms with risk of cancer, we conduct this meta-analysis. Materials and methods: We have searched relevant articles from the PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases up to May 3, 2019. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed to assess the relationship between these two genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to cancer. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata 12.0 software. Results: Thirty-five articles were eligible in this meta-analysis, including 17,746 cases and 21,808 controls. Our results suggested that the miR-26a-1 rs7372209 polymorphism was associated with the susceptibility to overall cancer significantly in homozygote comparison and recessive model (TT versus CC: OR = 1.167, 95% CI: 1.025-1.329, P = 0.020; TT versus CT + CC: OR = 1.162, 95% CI: 1.025-1.318, P = 0.019). For miR-423 rs6505162, this study showed that the relationship between it and overall cancer susceptibility was statistically significant among five genetic models (CA versus CC: OR = 0.884, 95% CI: 0.806-0.969, P = 0.009; AA + CA versus CC: OR = 0.870, 95% CI: 0.789-0.959, P = 0.005; AA versus CA + CC: OR = 0.904, 95% CI: 0.827-0.988, P = 0.026; A versus C: OR = 0.899, 95% CI: 0.834-0.970, P = 0.006) rather than homozygote model.

WoS,"Multi-scaled identification of landscape character types and areas in Lushan National Park and its fringes, China","China's national parks adopt a resource-oriented protection and planning approach that cannot restrain the continuous landscape fragmentation and deterioration, whereas, we propose to characterise the landscape in order to protect its integrity. This paper described a hierarchical identification of landscape character types and areas in Lushan National Park and its fringes according to a refined combination of the parametric and the holistic methods in a multiscalar approach. In terms of the functional hierarchy of landscape character, we decided to order the available data sources in 'downscaling'. At the broad scale, landscape typologies were delimited by raster datasets of four natural attributes: land cover, soil, vegetation, and altitude. At the intermediate scale, landscape typologies were determined by raster datasets of six natural and cultural attributes: aspect, slope, relief amplitude, heritage density, geology and land use. At these two scales, we adopted the principal component analysis (PCA) and two-step cluster analysis in SPSS software to visualise landscape types, to modify and integrate the results obtained in the eCognition software, as well as to rectify the visualisation with manual identifications. At the detailed scale, landscape typologies were demarcated by two raster and one vector datasets of cultural attributes: building density, visual influence and time depth. We performed the visualisation and integration with a similar method except for the PCA step. This multi-scaled identification will provide a nested framework facilitating the integration of the broad Lushan region in both spatial and administrative dimensions.",Landscape character; Landscape classification; eCognition; Cluster analysis; GIS,"Yang, DC; Gao, C; Li, LY; Van Eetvelde, V",2020.0,Journal,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103844,"[Yang, Diechuan; Gao, Chi] Huazhong Agr Univ, Sch Hort & Forestry Sci, Dept Landscape Architecture, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Li, Luyuan] Univ Ghent, Dept Architecture & Urban Planning, Jozef Plateaustr 22, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Eetvelde, Veerle] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",ELSEVIER,English,0169-2046,
WoS,New insights into the variability of lactic acid production in Lachancea thermotolerans at the phenotypic and genomic level,"Non-conventional yeasts are increasingly applied in fermented beverage industry to obtain distinctive products with improved quality. Among these yeasts, Lachancea thermotolerans has multiple features of industrial relevance, especially the production of L( + )-lactic acid (LA), useful for the biological acidification of wine and beer. Since few information is available on this peculiar activity, the current study aimed to explore the physiological and genetic variability among L. thermotolerans strains. From a strain collection, mostly isolated from wine, a huge phenotypic diversity was acknowledged and allowed the selection of a high (SOL13) and a low (COLC27) LA producer. Comparative whole-genome sequencing of these two selected strains and the type strain CBS 6340(T) showed a high similarity in terms of gene content and functional annotation. Notwithstanding, target gene-based analysis revealed variations between high and low producers in the key gene sequences related to LA accumulation. More in-depth investigation of the core promoters and expression analysis of the genes Idh, encoding lactate dehydrogenase, indicated the transcriptional regulation may be the principal cause behind phenotypic differences. These findings highlighted the usefulness of whole-genome sequencing coupled with expression analysis. They provided crucial genetic insights for a deeper investigation of the intraspecific variability in LA production pathway.",Lachancea thermotolerans; L(+)-Lactic acid; Intraspecific variability; Biological acidification; Whole-genome sequencing; Gene expression,"Gatto, V; Binati, RL; Lemos, WJF; Basile, A; Treu, L; de Almeida, OGG; Innocente, G; Campanaro, S; Torriani, S",2020.0,Journal,MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,10.1016/j.micres.2020.126525,"[Gatto, Veronica; Binati, Renato L.; Lemos, Wilson J.

WoS,Integer programming models versus advanced planning business software for a multi-level mixed-model assembly line problem,"Many manufactures are shifting from classical production environments with large batch sizes towards mixed-model assembly lines due to increasing product variations and highly individual customer requests. However, an assembly line should still be run with constant speed and cycle time. Clearly, the consecutive production of different models will cause a highly unbalanced temporal distribution of workload. This can be avoided by moving some assembly steps to pre-levels thus smoothing out the utilization of the main line. In the resulting multi-level assembly line the sequencing decision on the main line has to take into account the balancing of workload for all pre-levels. Otherwise, the modules or parts delivered from the pre-levels would cause congestion of the main line. One planning strategy aims at mixing the models on the main line to avoid blocks of identical units. In this contribution we compare two different realizations for this approach. On one hand we present a mixed-integer programming model (MIP), strengthen it by adding valid inequalities and enrich it with a number of relevant practical extensions. Also the actual objective of explicitly balancing pre-level workloads is considered. On the other hand, we illustrate how this strategy could be realized in an advanced planning system linked to an enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP APO. Finally, we perform a computational study to investigate the possibilities and limitations of MIP models and the realization in SAP APO. The experiments rely on a real-world production planning problem of a company producing engines and gearboxes.",Multi-level production system; Load balancing; Model-mix planning; Mixed-integer programming; SAP APO,"Kreiter, T; Pferschy, U",2020.0,Journal,CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH,10.1007/s10100-019-00642-z,"[Kreiter, Tobias; Pferschy, Ulrich] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria",SPRINGER,English,1435-246X,
WoS,Investigation on the radiation shielding properties of lead silicate glasses modified by ZnO and BaO,"Lead glasses are a category of silicate glasses used for the absorption of electromagnetic waves. In this research, the radiation shielding properties of xSiO(2)center dot(1-x)PbO2 Glass system by adding 5, 10, and 15 mol.% of ZnO and BaO (that the value of additive decreases equally from SiO2 and PbO2 percentages) are investigated. Characterization includes XRD, SEM, EDAX, DRS (UV-vis), and density analyses. DRS analysis and XCOM software are utilized to investigate the absorption value in the range of 200-900 nm and gamma-ray wavelength, respectively. It was revealed that the more ZnO and BaO percentages lead to higher absorption values. The Tauc plot showed that by increasing ZnO or BaO percentage, optical band-gap energies decrease, leading to a higher refractive index and less transparency. In the range of gamma-ray wavelength, XCOM software showed that the best absorption value among all synthesized lead glasses is attributed to the glass containing 15% ZnO that for example, at 0.015 MeV provides 8.28% increase in mass absorption coefficient in comparison to the base sample. Besides, in the range of UV-vis wavelength, the highest absorption belongs to lead glass containing 15% ZnO. Therefore, 51%SiO2-34% PbO2-15%ZnO was selected as the best candidate for protective lead glasses.

Sample success rate of the Rapid DNA system for buccal swab samples, and blood and muscle DVI samples were calculated. Success rates of buccal swab samples were 100% and 75% using cassettes preloaded with all reagents suitable for high- and low-DNA content samples, respectively. Success rates of fresh DVI samples were 80% to 100%. Success rates of putrefied DVI samples varied widely between 0% and 20% and 50% to 80% depending on cassette and sample types.

WoS,Thermal evolution of the intracratonic Paris Basin: Insights from 3D basin modelling,"The thermal evolution of the Paris Basin (PB) has been widely studied using 1D, 2D and, more rarely, 3D thermal models. It is well documented that the PB experienced higher temperatures in the past compared to what is currently observed. However, a quantitative analysis of the main processes and parameters that affect the temperature distribution, at the basin scale and over time, is still not available. In this study, through basin modeling which accounts for the main processes of the thermal evolution of sedimentary basins, we analyze and quantify the role of the different geological mechanisms by discriminating the causes of abnormal temperatures during the Late Mesozoic. This is done with a 3D basin model built from base Moho to present-day topography using the TemisFlow (R) basin modelling software. The model includes thermal processes within an evolving upper crust defined by three main structural domains. Each crustal sector presents radiogenic heat production, conductivity and thickness values which are used as input parameters to reproduce the paleo- and present-day basal heat flow variations observed in the basin. The model calculates heat flow through time in both, crust and sedimentary column where the crust is coupled with the geological evolution of the basin. This approach allows estimating the eroded thickness during the main Tertiary uplift event and therefore the maximum temperature in the Late Cretaceous. The model is constrained by different types of paleo-thermo-chronometers and by 52 wells that are regionally distributed over the entire basin, resulting in a new regional thermal history of the PB. The amount of missing section in the Cretaceous chalk which mainly affected the eastern part of the basin is increased by up to 500m compared with previous studies and constitutes the key controlling factor of the temperature evolution. This new regional thermal history of the Paris Basin may be important for further analysis of the HC generation from the Lower Jurassic Toarcian source-rock and bring new insights into the geothermal potential of the basin.",,"Torelli, M; Traby, R; Teles, V; Ducros, M",2020.0,Journal,MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY,10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2020.104487,"[Torelli, Martina; Traby, Renaud; Teles, Vanessa; Ducros, Mathieu] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Ducros, Mathieu] C6 Consultoria & Treinamento Informat Ltda, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0264-8172,
WoS,The physical separation between the LET associated with the ultimate relative biological effect (RBE) and the maximum LET in a proton or ion beam,"Purpose: To identify the relative positions of the ultimate RBE, at a LET value of LETU (where the LET-RBE turnover point occurs independently of dose), and of the maximum LET (LETM) for a range of ions from protons to Iron ions.Methods:For a range of relativistic velocities (beta), the kinetic energies, LET values and ranges for each ion are obtained using SRIM software. For protons and helium ions, the LET changes with beta are plotted and LETM is compared with LETU. For all the ions studied the residual ranges of particles at LETU and LETM are subtracted to provide the physical separation (S) between LETU and LETM. Results:Graphical methods are used to show the above parameters for protons and helium ions. For all the ions studied, LET(U)occurs at kinetic energies which are higher than those at LETM, so the ultimate maximal RBE occurs proximal to the Bragg peak for individual particles and not beyond it, as is commonly supposed. The distance S, between LETU and LETM, appears to increase linearly with the atomic charge value Z.Conclusions:For the lighter elements, from protons to carbon ions, S is sufficiently small (less than the tolerance/accuracy of radiation treatments) and so will probably not influence therapeutic decisions or outcomes. For higher Z numbers such as Argon and Iron, larger S values of several centimetres occur, which may have implications not only in any proposed therapeutic beams but also at very low doses encountered in radiation protection where the few cells that are irradiated will typically be traversed by a single particle.",radiation physics; hadrontherapy; proton therapy; radiobiology,"Jones, B; Hill, MA",2020.0,Journal,BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS,10.1088/2057-1976/ab9e13,"[Jones, Bleddyn; Hill, Mark A.] Univ Oxford, CRUK MRC Oxford Inst Radiat Oncol & Biol, Gray Lab, Old Rd Campus,Res Bldg,Roosevelt Dr, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England",IOP PUBLISHING LTD,English,2057-1976,
WoS,Sickle cell disease clinical phenotypes in Nigeria: A preliminary analysis of the Sickle Pan Africa Research Consortium Nigeria database,"Background/objective: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disease with multiple phenotypic expressions. Previous studies describing SCD clinical phenotypes in Nigeria were localized, with limited data, hence the need to understand how SCD varies across Nigeria. Method: The Sickle Pan African Research Consortium (SPARCO) with a hub in Tanzania and collaborative sites in Tanzania, Ghana and Nigeria, is establishing a single patient-consented electronic database with a target of 13,000 SCD patients. In collaboration with the Sickle Cell Support Society of Nigeria, 20 hospitals, with paediatric and adult SCD clinics, are participating in patient recruitment. Demographic and clinical information, collected with uniform case report forms, were entered into Excel spreadsheets and uploaded into Research Electronic Data Capture software by trained data clerks and frequency tables generated. Result: Data were available on 3622 patients enrolled in the database, comprising 1889 (52.9%) females and 1434 (39.6%) children <= 15 years. The frequencies of Hb SS, Hb SC and Hb S beta thalassemia in this data set were 97.5%, 2.5% and 0% respectively. Sixty percent, 23.8%, 5.9%, 4.8% and 2.5% have had bone pain crisis, dactylitis, acute chest syndrome, priapism and stroke respectively. The most frequent chronic complications were: leg ulcers (6.5%), avascular necrosis of bone (6.0%), renal (6.3%) and pulmonary hypertension (1.1%). Only 13.2% had been hospitalized while 67.5% had received blood transfusion.

WoS,Computed tomography medical image reconstruction on affordable equipment by using Out-Of-Core techniques,"Background and objective: As Computed Tomography scans are an essential medical test, many techniques have been proposed to reconstruct high-quality images using a smaller amount of radiation. One approach is to employ algebraic factorization methods to reconstruct the images, using fewer views than the traditional analytical methods. However, their main drawback is the high computational cost and hence the time needed to obtain the images, which is critical in the daily clinical practice. For this reason, faster methods for solving this problem are required. Methods: In this paper, we propose a new reconstruction method based on the QR factorization that is very efficient on affordable equipment (standard multicore processors and standard Solid-State Drives) by using Out-Of-Core techniques. Results: Combining both affordable hardware and the new software proposed in our work, the images can be reconstructed very quickly and with high quality. We analyze the reconstructions using real Computed Tomography images selected from a dataset, comparing the QR method to the LSQR and FBP. We measure the quality of the images using the metrics Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index, obtaining very high values. We also compare the efficiency of using spinning disks versus Solid-State Drives, showing how the latter performs the Input/Output operations in a significantly lower amount of time. Conclusions: The results indicate that our proposed me thod and software are valid to efficiently solve large-scale systems and can be applied to the Computed Tomography reconstruction problem to obtain high-quality images.

WoS,Biomechanical analysis for five fixation techniques of Pauwels-III fracture by finite element modeling,"Background and objectives: There are many fixation methods for Pauwels- III fracture, the most common implants are Locking Plate (LP), Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS), Multiple Lag Screw (MLS), and mixed fixture (DHS+ MLS) implants, the common procedure is HemiArthroplasty (HA). However, how these fixtures biomechanically function is not clear. The aims of this study are to compare the mechanical behaviors of these five implants by finite element modeling and determinate the most suitable procedure for individuals with Pauwels- III fractures. Methods: We gathered 20 sets of femur images from CT scans in the *. dicom format first, and then processed them by using reverse engineering software programs, such as Mimics, Geomagic Studio, UG-8, Pro-Engineer and HyperMesh. Finally, we assembled and analyzed the five types of fixture models, the LP, DHS, MLS, DHS + LS and HA models, by AnSys. Results: These numerical models of Pauwels III fractures, including fixators and a simulative HA, were validated by a previous study and a cadaver test. Our analytical findings include the following: the displacements of all fixtures were between 0.3801 and 1.0834 mm, and the differences were not statistically significantly different; the resulting average peaks in stress were e(Ha) = 43.859 <= d(LP) = 60.435 <= b(MLS) = 68.678 < c(LS+DHS) = 98.478 < a(DHS) = 248.595 in Mpa, indicating that the stress of DHS and DHS+ LS are greater than those of LP, HA and MLS, while the last 3 models were not significantly different.

WoS,Micro- and macrostructure changes of soil under irrigation with electromagnetically treated water,"Electromagnetic treatment of irrigation water (ETIW) for agricultural purposes is increasingly studied, especially for saline water, but little is known about its effect on soil structure. The aim of this study was to quantify pore changes due to ETIW applied to a cultivated soil. The study was performed on undisturbed soil in pots subject to 12 treatments: two types of irrigation water (treated electromagnetically or untreated) x three irrigation doses xtwo cultivation statuses (cultivated or uncultivated). The structure of soil samples taken from the surface layer at the end of the experiment was studied by impregnating it with a fluorescent resin and examining horizontal polished sections. Images were analyzed using Visilog software at two spatial resolutions (micro- and macro-morphological) to quantify pores classified according to size and shape at each scale. No significant difference in porosity was found among depths, regardless of scale. Soil porosity increased slightly as the irrigation dose increased. Cultivation had no significant effect on porosity at either scale. In contrast, ETIW had a strong effect on porosity, which, on average among depths, increased from 8.8-11.4 % to 11.9-14.8 % at the macroscopic scale and from 13.1-14.2 % to 20.6-22.7 % at the microscopic scale. At the macroscopic scale, pores of all morphological types increased after ETIW. At the microscopic scale, packing pores increased the most after ETIW, while cracks and tubular voids changed the least. Our results suggest that ETIW thus acts on soil structure by fragmenting soil material at a fine scale and creating abundant interstitial porosity between aggregates by crumbling. ETIW can improve soil properties greatly by increasing soil porosity at two scales. Through this porosity, water, solutes and gases can diffuse through the ground, thus increasing exchange processes.",Soil structure; Porosity; Image analysis; Electromagnetic water treatment,"Moussa, M; Hallaire, V; Michot, D; Hachicha, M",2020.0,Journal,SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH,10.1016/j.still.2020.104690,"[Moussa, Malak; Hachicha, Mohamed] Univ Carthage, Natl Res Inst Rural Engn Water & Forests, 17 Rue Hedi Karray,BP 10, Ariana 2080, Tunisia; [Moussa, Malak] Univ Carthage, Natl Agron Inst Tunisia, 43 Ave Charles Nicolle, Tunis 1082, Mahrajene, Tunisia; [Hallaire, Vincent; Michot, Didier] AGROCAMPUS OUEST, INRAE, UMR SAS, F-35000 Rennes, France",ELSEVIER,English,0167-1987,
WoS,Standardization and standards in Bulgarian libraries: Current state,"The article contains the results of an empirical study conducted in the early 2018 through a survey conducted among the libraries in Bulgaria. Data obtained were processed by the software product for mathematical analysis of statistical data SPSS for Windows 19.0. The aim of the study is to create a complete picture of the Bulgarian library system in terms of understanding the benefits of standardization activity and the application of specific standards in the field of library activities. The applied research methods are: research, analysis and synthesis of information received, a comparative analysis between different groups of libraries participated in the survey. In order to specify the psychometric characteristics of the methods and verification of the working hypothesis, the following methods for statistical processing were applied: descriptive statistics; correlation analysis; factorial analysis; one-way ANOVA test. This study is the first large-scale study of its kind on standardization among Bulgarian libraries. Its contributions can be assigned to those that enrich the theory and methodology of sociological studies in the field of library activities. As a result of the survey the current level of application of the specific national, branch and international standards in the Bulgarian libraries was established.

WoS,Large scale SNP unearthing and genetic architecture analysis in sea-captured and cultured populations of Cynoglossus semilaevis,"Knowledge on population structure and genetic diversity is a focal point for association mapping studies and genomic selection. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) represents an innovative method for large scale SNP detection and genotyping of genetic resources. Here we used the GBS approach for the genome-wide identification of SNPs in a collection of Cynoglossus semilaevis and for the assessment of the level of genetic diversity in C. semilaevis genotypes. GBS analysis generated a total of 55.12 Gb high-quality sequence data, with an average of 0.63 Gb per sample. The total number of SNP markers was 563, 109. In order to explore the genetic diversity of C. semilaevis and to select a minimal core set representing most of the total genetic variation with minimum redundancy, C. semilaevis sequences were analyzed using high quality SNPs. Based on hierarchical clustering, it was possible to divide the collection into 2 clusters. The marine fishing populations were clustered and clearly separated from the cultured populations, and the cultured populations from Hebei was also distinct from the other two local populations. These analyses showed that genotypes were clustered based on species-related features. Differential significant SNPs were also captured and validated by GBS and SNaPshot, with linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis, seven SNPs have been confirmed to have obvious differentiation in two populations, which may be used as the characteristic evaluation sites of sea-captured and cultured Cynoglossus semilaevis populations. And SNP markers and information on population structure developed in this study will undoubtedly support genome-wide association mapping studies and marker-assisted selection programs. These differential SNPs could be also employed as the characteristic evaluation sites of sea-captured and cultured Cynoglossus semilaevis populations in future.",Genotyping by sequencing; Cynoglossus semilaevis; Population structure; Single nucleotide polymorphism,"Zhang, B; Jia, L; He, XX; Chen, CX; Liu, H; Liu, KF; Zhao, N; Bao, BL",2020.0,Journal,GENOMICS,10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.06.013,"[Zhang, Bo; Bao, Baolong] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Explorat & Utilizat Aquat Genet Resources, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bo; Bao, Baolong] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Minist Sci & Technol, Int Res Ctr Marine Biosci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bo; Bao, Baolong] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Natl Demonstrat Ctr Expt Fisheries Sci Educ, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bo; Jia, Lei; He, Xiaoxu; Chen, Chunxiu; Liu, Hao; Liu, Kefeng] Tianjin Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Na] Tianjin Haolinsaiao Biotechnol Co Ltd, Tianjin, Peoples R China",ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,English,0888-7543,
WoS,Evaluation of factors contributing to the failure of information systems in public universities: The case of Iran,"In this paper, we evaluate the reasons for the failure of information systems in public universities. To that end, we start by presenting a hierarchical structure of criteria after reviewing related studies, and dividing the criteria into the categories of project management, organizational management, human-related, organizational and technical. To assess the weight of the criteria in the proposed framework, we collect the opinions of a sample of information technology experts working in different public universities in Iran, using an online questionnaire that is based on the best-worst method (BWM). By analyzing the weight of the criteria, we can reveal that misfit of information systems software (closely followed by lack of top management support and unsuccessful monitoring and measurement) has the greatest impact on the failure of information systems in the public universities of Iran.

WoS,"Winter is here! A decade of cache-based side-channel attacks, detection & mitigation for RSA","Timing-based side-channels play an important role in exposing the state of a process execution on underlying hardware by revealing information about timing and access patterns. Side-channel attacks (SCAs) are powerful cryptanalysis techniques that focus on the underlying implementation of cryptographic ciphers during execution rather than attacking the structure of cryptographic functions. This paper reviews cache-based software side-channel attacks, mitigation and detection techniques that target various cryptosystems, particularly RSA, proposed over the last decade (2007-2018). It provides a detailed taxonomy of attacks on RSA cryptosystems and discusses their strengths and weaknesses while attacking different algorithmic implementations of RSA. A threat model is presented based on the cache features that are being leveraged for such attacks across cache hierarchy in computing architectures. The paper also provides a classification of these attacks based on the source of information leakage. It then undertakes a qualitative analysis of secret key retrieval efficiency, complexity, and the features being exploited on target cryptosystems in these attacks. The paper also discusses the mitigation and detection techniques proposed against such attacks and classifies them based on their effectiveness at various levels in caching hardware and leveraged features. Finally, the paper discusses recent trends in attacks, the challenges involved in their mitigation, and future research directions needed to deal with side-channel information leakage.

WoS,Addressing medically underserved populations through maternal-fetal transport: a geographic analysis,"Objective:Despite regionalization of maternal care in the USA, there is little contemporary information on characteristics and utilization of maternal-fetal transport. We used geographic analysis to investigate referral and transportation patterns of the maternal-fetal transport service at our institution. Methods:This is a retrospective cohort study of all calls taken by our maternal-fetal transfer service. Call logs were abstracted, and diagnoses, gestational ages, referring hospital, and mode of transportation were analyzed. The United States Health Resources and Services Administration's Medically Underserved Area (MUA) designations were used to identify hospitals in these areas. Geographic information system software was used to analyze and map geographic variables, including frequency of transfers from each hospital, distance traveled, mode of transfer, and MUAs. Results:From November 2012 to March 2017, there were 835 telephone consults without transfer and 1682 patients transferred from 103 hospitals. Preterm labor was the most common diagnosis (n = 338, 20%), followed by hypertensive disorders (n = 231, 14%). There were 738 transfers (44%) from MUAs, and 20 (19%) of hospitals were critical access hospitals, accounting for 121 (7%) transfers. One-way trips from a referring hospital accounted for 659 patients, and the transport team was dispatched in 1023 cases. The median distance traveled was 24 mi. For hospitals within 50 mi, the mean difference in transport time between air and ground was <1 h, yet there were 73 air round trips for hospitals Conclusion:The transfer system is robust and supports underserved hospitals; however, the service could be deployed more efficiently.",Geographic analysis; maternal-fetal transport; medical transportation; regional perinatal care; underserved areas,"Rosenbloom, JI; Nelson, DM; Saunders, S; Cole, FS; Chandarlis, J; Macones, GA; Cahill, AG",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE,10.1080/14767058.2018.1564028,"[Rosenbloom, Joshua I.; Nelson, D.

WoS,Voltage-gated ion channels mediate the electrotaxis of glioblastoma cells in a hybrid PMMA/PDMS microdevice,"Transformed astrocytes in the most aggressive form cause glioblastoma, the most common cancer in the central nervous system with high mortality. The physiological electric field by neuronal local field potentials and tissue polarity may guide the infiltration of glioblastoma cells through the electrotaxis process. However, microenvironments with multiplex gradients are difficult to create. In this work, we have developed a hybrid microfluidic platform to study glioblastoma electrotaxis in controlled microenvironments with high throughput quantitative analysis by machine learning-powered single cell tracking software. By equalizing the hydrostatic pressure difference between inlets and outlets of the microchannel, uniform single cells can be seeded reliably inside the microdevice. The electrotaxis of two glioblastoma models, T98G and U-251MG, requires an optimal laminin-containing extracellular matrix and exhibits opposite directional and electro-alignment tendencies. Calcium signaling is a key contributor in glioblastoma pathophysiology but its role in glioblastoma electrotaxis is still an open question. Anodal T98G electrotaxis and cathodal U-251MG electrotaxis require the presence of extracellular calcium cations. U-251MG electrotaxis is dependent on the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) and T98G is dependent on the R-type VGCC. U-251MG electrotaxis and T98G electrotaxis are also mediated by A-type (rapidly inactivating) voltage-gated potassium channels and acid-sensing sodium channels. The involvement of multiple ion channels suggests that the glioblastoma electrotaxis is complex and patient-specific ion channel expression can be critical to develop personalized therapeutics to fight against cancer metastasis. The hybrid microfluidic design and machine learning-powered single cell analysis provide a simple and flexible platform for quantitative investigation of complicated biological systems.",,"Tsai, HF; IJspeert, C; Shen, AQ",2020.0,Journal,APL BIOENGINEERING,10.1063/5.0004893,"[Tsai, Hsieh-Fu; IJspeert, Camilo; Shen, Amy Q.] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Micro Bio Nanofluid Unit, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan",AMER INST PHYSICS,English,2473-2877,
WoS,Characteristics and dynamics of compressible cavitating flows with special emphasis on compressibility effects,"The objective of the paper is to investigate the physics involved in the compressible cavitating flows, with emphasis on the compressibility effects. 3-D numerical simulations were conducted on the open source software platform OpenFOAM, using both the native incompressible cavitation solver interPhaseChange-FOAM and implemented compressible cavitation solver, where the cavitation model and turbulence model are kept the same and differences of the two approaches mainly root in the density variances of pure liquid and pure vapor. Results are presented for the transient sheet/cloud cavitating flows around a Clark-Y hydrofoil fixed at attack of angle alpha=8 degrees at inlet velocity U-10m/s and cavitation number sigma =0.8, where both ensemble averaged statistics and transient characteristics are analyzed. Good agreement can be obtained using both the incompressible and compressible approaches when compared with the experiment data. While it is found that compared with the incompressible approach, the compressible approach can predict the unsteady cavitation evolution and cavity shedding frequency better. With the compressibility effects considered, the time averaged void fraction distribution decreases, and the cavity size (i.e. cavitation area) becomes smaller. The re-entrant flow thickness normalized by local cavity thickness predicted by the compressible approach is larger than that by the incompressible approach, indicating that the compressible approach can predict the re-entrant jet dynamics well. The velocity divergence analysis show that compared with that in incompressible approach, where velocity divergence mainly comes from the mass transfer between phases, in compressible approach, the velocity divergence originates from both the cavitation two-phase fluid compressibility and mass transfer, and the fluid density variance dominates in compressible results. Following, the budget analysis of vorticity transport equation (VTE) show that the vortex stretching term dominates the cavitation vortex dynamics. Compressibility effects will significantly increase the dilatation term and decrease baroclinic term by decreasing the misalignment between density gradient and pressure gradient. Finally, the temperature and density variance in different cavitation structures are presented. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,"Energy, exergy, and economic analyses of a new integrated system for generation of power and liquid fuels using liquefied natural gas regasification and solar collectors","Simultaneous design of units and process integration reduce the number of unnecessary equipment and energy consumption. In this paper, an integrated structure is developed and analyzed for liquid fuels and power co-generation, using the air separation unit, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis unit, steam power plant, and organic Rankine power generation unit. Liquefied natural gas regasification and solar dish collectors are employed to supply the cooling and heating for the integrated structure, respectively. The integrated process is simulated and designed using MATLAB, HYSYS, and TRNSYS software packages, where a systematic sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effects of operating conditions on the process behaviors/performance. This integrated plant generates 200.6 MW power and 78.88 kgmol/h liquid fuels. The overall thermal energy and total exergy efficiencies of the integrated approach are 42.36% and 64.72%, respectively.

WoS,Multi-objective optimization of energy and water management in networked hubs considering transactive energy,"It is undeniable that the energy crisis and the reduced underground freshwater are challenging topics in the world and this issue have encouraged the researchers to seek different ways to solve them. One solution to fix the energy dilemma is energy hub concept in which the transactive energy can be transferred between the hubs. In addition, the industrial desalination units that use power to change the brackish water into potable water are proposed to address the freshwater shortage. It goes without saying that these two solutions behave inversely, so in order to minimize both the energy and freshwater extracted from underground reservoirs, a multi-objective procedure is applied in this study. The epsilon-constraint method and fuzzy satisfying approach are employed to find the most preferred solution in this proposed multi-objective problem. Reported results on how the water system adjusts its scheduling, considering the energy system conditions, validate the fact that the interdependent energy and water structures should be replaced by the proposed framework in the future works.

WoS,Using a volumetric apparatus to identify and measure the mass transfer resistance in commercial adsorbents,"The mass transfer coefficient is a fundamental property needed to design adsorption gas separations. A collaborative study is presented where commercial LiLSX beads used in air vacuum swing adsorption for the production of oxygen are tested in two volumetric apparatuses. The initial results based on the software available in the commercial system seemed to point to a surface barrier model for the adsorption kinetics of nitrogen, but this system is known to be macropore diffusion controlled. A detailed model of the system and a new way of representing the experimental data are used to show that the mass transfer kinetics is clearly a diffusion process. Guidelines and recommendations on which tests are needed to ensure the correct use of a volumetric system in this case are presented. Through the correct interpretation of the flow through the valve in the two volumetric apparatuses, consistency in the mass transfer time constant is achieved. The effect of using the correct diffusion time constant vs the one obtained using the traditional approach is demonstrated comparing a typical oxygen vacuum swing adsorption process.

WoS,Morphometric characterization of collagen and fat in normal ventricular myocardium,"Objective: We used automated image analysis software to determine the proportion of collagen, fat, and myocytes across six histological regions of normal ventricular myocardium. Methods: Twenty-nine non -cardiac death cases referred to our national cardiac pathology center were included in this study. Whole hearts were macroscopically and microscopically normal following expert histopathological evaluation. Tissue sections from the right ventricular outflow tract, right ventricle (RV), anterior interventricular septum (IVS), posterior IVS, anterior left ventricle (LV), and posterior LV were stained with Picrosirius red for collagen and scanned using a high -resolution slide scanner. Quantifica- tion of collagen, fat, and myocyte proportions was performed using Visiopharm software after automated exclusion of perivascular collagen. Results: The majority of decedents were male (25/29; 86%) with a mean age at death of 32.1 +/- 9.9 (range 18-54) and mean BMI 28.7 +/- 7.3. We report predicted values (collagen %, fat %, myocytes %) for cardiac tissue composition within the RV, IVS, and LV (including epicardial and endocardial layers). The propor- tion of collagen and fat were higher in the RV compared with the LV (ratios 1.61 [1.45-1.78]; 2.63 [1.99- 3.48], respectively) and RV compared with the IVS (ratios 1.77 [1.60-1.97]; 8.41[6.35-11.13], respectively). The ratio of epicardial versus endocardial fat was increased in both ventricles (RV: ratio 4.49 [3.67-5.49]; LV: ratio 3.46 [2.49-4.81]). In multivariable analysis, there was no significant association between colla- gen or fat proportion and sex (p = 0.12; p = 0.08, respectively), age at death (p = 0.36; p = 0.23, respectively), or BMI (p = 0.45; p = 0.43, respectively). Conclusions: Our findings provide location and sex -specific proportions of myocardial histological tissue composition that may aid quantitative evaluation of pathology in future studies.

WoS,Lecture capture in pharmacy education at UBC: Updating our understanding,"Introduction: Lecture capture is a contemporary learning technology used to improve the quality of professional programs such as pharmacy. Building on our 2014 study, the objective of this study was to reexamine the value of lecture capture for student and faculty users and make decisions about its continuance and optimization. Methods: Survey methodology was used to gather student and faculty perspectives on the lecture recordings. Collected data focused on usage, learning impacts, and attendance. Lecture capture software provided analytics on student viewing patterns. The constant comparative method was used to analyze student and faculty comments for underlying themes and data discrepancies. Results: Following an evolutionary development path, lecture capture has become a mainstream learning resource for students and faculty. Student usage has increased dramatically and strategically. In addition to enhancing in-class experiences, study effectiveness, and overall learning, students continue to claim minimal impacts on attendance. Faculty perspectives remain modest. While faculty recognize the learning benefits for students and are prepared to continue using lecture recordings, issues related to absenteeism are increasingly troublesome. Faculty are also using lecture recordings for faculty development purposes. Conclusions: Faculty have renewed their commitment to the lecture capture program going forward. Importantly, the study has helped refocus the evolution of the program away from binary questions such as whether or not to use lecture recordings and the impacts of lecture capture on attendance and towards specific guidance for students and faculty on the best use of the resource and deeper questions about student learning.",Educational technology; Lecture capture; Lecture recordings; Attendance; Scholarship of teaching and learning,"Albon, SP; Larson, K; Marchand, JP",2020.0,Journal,CURRENTS IN PHARMACY TEACHING AND LEARNING,10.1016/j.cptl.2020.04.031,"[Albon, Simon P.; Larson, Kane] Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, 2405 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Marchand, Jon-Paul] Univ British Columbia, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, Off Educ Technol & Learning Designs, 2405 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,English,1877-1297,

WoS,A generic approach to analysing failures in human - System interaction in autonomy,"Autonomous systems operation will in the foreseeable future rely on the interaction between software, hardware and humans. Efficient interaction and communication between these agents are crucial for safe operation. Conventional methods for hazard identification and safety assessment focus often on one of the aspects of the system only, e.g., human reliability, software failures, or equipment reliability. The method Human-System Interaction in Autonomy (H-SIA) was recently proposed, focusing on autonomous ships operation and collision scenarios. H-SIA provides a framework for analyzing autonomous ship operation as an entirety, rather than each agent separately. The method comprised initially of two main elements: An Event Sequence Diagram (ESD) and a Concurrent Task Analysis (CoTA). While the ESD models the events that can take place following an initiating event, the CoTA models which tasks the agents must perform for these events to succeed. This paper extends HSIA to include the paths to failure, through the development of Fault Trees (FTs), which is necessary for risk analysis and identification of risk reduction measures. The FTs development of H-SIA introduces novelties in comparison to common FTs: (i) they model the system as whole, (ii) they are generic and can accommodate a diversity of systems designs; (iii) they lead to basic failure events. The FTs allows for identification of failure events arising through interaction between autonomous ship and human operators, as well as failure propagation through these agents. The basic failure events are applicable for different autonomous concepts. A case study on autonomous ship collision demonstrates the use of the extended method. The case study illustrates HSIA's applicability to different designs and levels of autonomy, its potential for identification of failure events, and its use in risk assessments.",Autonomous systems; Autonomous ship; Risk assessment; Human-autonomy interaction; System design,"Ramos, MA; Thieme, CA; Utne, IB; Mosleh, A",2020.0,Journal,SAFETY SCIENCE,10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104808,"[Ramos, Marilia A.; Thieme, Christoph A.; Utne, Ingrid B.; Mosleh, Ali] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Ramos, Marilia A.; Mosleh, Ali] Univ Calif Los Angeles, B John Garrick Inst Risk Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",ELSEVIER,English,0925-7535,
WoS,Experimental and numerical studies of bolted T-stub steel connection with different flange thicknesses connected to a rigid base,"This paper presents experimental and Finite Element (FE) analyses of T-Stub steel connections. Such connection may be classified as rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible. For rigid T-Stub, no praying action is observed. For flexible T-Stubs, praying action may overload the bolts. A better knowledge of the contact stresses distribution between T-Stub flange and support base helps understand the resistance mechanism of the T-Stub connections. The contact area between T-Stub flange and support base depends largely on the flange thickness. This paper investigates the effect of the thickness of T-Stub connections fixed to a rigid support base. Nonlinear FE models utilizing ABAQUS software were developed to study the behavior of T-Stub connections. The results obtained from FE analyses were verified against experimental results. A parametric study was conducted to observe the effects of flange thickness on (a) the contact stress distribution between the flange and rigid base, (b) the prying actions on bolts, and (c) the shear stresses on bolts. The results from experimental tests and FE analyses were compared with T-Stub resistance capacity calculated using the provisions of Eurocode-3 and AISC.",T-Stub connections; Contact stresses; Prying action; Shear stresses on bolts,"Bezerra, LM; Bonilla, J; Silva, WA; Matias, WT",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110770,"[Bezerra, Luciano M.; Matias, William T.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Bonilla, Jorge] Univ Ciego de Avila, Grp Numer Methods Engn, Ciego De Avila, Cuba; [Silva, Wellington A.] Univ Fed Goias, Dept Civil Engn, Goiania, Go, Brazil",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0141-0296,
WoS,Effective live load mass for storage buildings on friction-pendulum isolators,"This paper presents the results from finite element models of based-isolated storage buildings subjected to ground motion excitation and supporting rigid blocks with the possibility to slide. Main components of the models were first compared and calibrated with the results from numerical solutions, finite element software, and shake table tests. The successfully verified finite element models were then used to assess ASCE 7-16 design provisions for the treatment of storage loads as seismic weight in base-isolated structures. The analyses included multi-story shear buildings of different heights and three-dimensional buildings of three-stories with both regular and irregular plans under combined horizontal and vertical ground excitation. Alternative low and high friction between the rigid blocks (representing the storage live load) and the floor deck were evaluated in the analyses as well as the effect of light versus heavy storage live loads. Ground excitation consisted of 100 records, covering scenarios that range from low to high seismic risk. The combination of cases included in the parametric study led to thousands of nonlinear time history analyses. Selected engineering design parameters (EDP) to conduct the evaluation consisted of isolator deformation and maximum force demands in the lateral load resting system. Calculated EDPs from the detailed models (accounting for inelastic response of the lateral load resisting system coupled with potential sliding of rigid blocks) were compared with calculated EDPs from simplified models with no blocks but having additional floor mass equal to 25% of the design live load. The latter models represented analysis conditions that ASCE 7-16 minimum provisions would allow in consulting practice. This study demonstrates that using the Standards minimum provision can lead to: i) significant underestimations of the deformation demand and thus unconservative designs of base isolators; ii) significant underestimations of design forces, and consequently, improper design of the lateral load resisting elements. In order to address these issues, a simple expression recently developed by the authors to estimate the portion of the design live load as seismic weight was also evaluated. It is shown that using the portion of the live load given by this equation in the simplified models with no blocks but having additional floor mass produce very similar EDPs as those obtained from the detailed models with sliding blocks and thus representing a significant improvement over the existing ASCE 7-16 minimum provisions when applied to base-isolated storage structures.",Structure-live load interaction; Live load as seismic weight; Base-isolated storage structures,"Reyes, JC; Herrera, MT; Smith-Pardo, JP; Cordoba, LS",2020.0,Journal,ENGINEERING STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110843,"[Reyes, Juan C.; Cordoba, Laura S.] Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bogota, Colombia; [Herrera, Marco T.] Univ Piura, Dept Civil Engn, Piura, Peru; [Smith-Pardo, J.

WoS,COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF KEYPOINT DETECTORS FOR 3D DIGITAL AVATAR RECONSTRUCTION,"Three-dimensional personalized human avatars have been successfully utilized in shopping, entertainment, education, and health applications. However, it is still a challenging task to obtain both a complete and highly detailed avatar automatically. One approach is to use general-purpose, photogrammetry-based algorithms on a series of overlapping images of the person. We argue that the quality of avatar reconstruction can be increased by modifying parts of the photogrammetry-based algorithm pipeline to be more specifically tailored to the human body shape. In this context, we perform an extensive, standalone evaluation of eleven algorithms for keypoint detection, which is the first phase of the photogrammetry-based reconstruction pipeline. We include well established, patented Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints (SIFT) and Speeded up robust features (SURF) detection algorithms as a baseline since they are widely incorporated into photogrammetry-based software. All experiments are conducted on a dataset of 378 images of human body captured in a controlled, multi-view stereo setup. Our findings are that binary detectors highly outperform commonly used SIFT-like detectors in the avatar reconstruction task, both in terms of detection speed and in number of detected keypoints.",Detector; Photogrammetry-based reconstruction; 3D human avatar; Structure from Motion; Multi-view Stereo,"Gajic, D; Gojic, G; Dragan, D; Petrovic, V",2020.0,Journal,FACTA UNIVERSITATIS-SERIES ELECTRONICS AND ENERGETICS,10.2298/FUEE2003379G,"[Gajic, Dusan; Gojic, Gorana; Dragan, Dinu; Petrovic, Veljko] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21102, Serbia",UNIV NIS,English,0353-3670,

In order to reduce the recombination caused by the presence of the quantum layers and increase the absorption of photons, electron blocking layers (EBLs) and hole blocking layers (HBLs) have been added to the solar cell in an In-0.5(Al0.7Ga0.3)(0.5)P semiconductor. The results show that the efficiency of the proposed solar cell increases 17.38% by obtaining impurity the thickness and doping of the EBL and HBL layers. It can be concluded that the use of the In-0.5(Al0.7Ga0.3)(0.5)P semiconductor with EBL and HBL layers decreases the open circuit voltage (V-oc) caused in the quantum wells.

WoS,Real-Time Anomaly Detection of NoSQL Systems Based on Resource Usage Monitoring,"Today, the emergence of the industry revolution systems such as Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, and big data frameworks poses new challenges in terms of storage and processing of real-time data. As systems scale in humongous sizes, a crucial task is to administer the variety of different subsystems and applications to ensure high performance. This is directly related with the identification and elimination of system failures and errors, while the system runs. In particular, database systems may experience abnormalities related with decreased throughput or increased resource usage, that in turn affects system performance. In this article, we focus on not only SQL (NoSQL) database systems that are ideal for storing sensor data in the concept of Industry 4.0. This typically includes a variety of applications and workloads that are difficult to online monitor, thus making anomaly detection a challenging task. Creating a robust platform to serve such infrastructures with minimum hardware or software failures is a key challenge. In this article, we propose RADAR, an anomaly detection system that works on real time. RADAR is a data-driven decision-making system for NoSQL systems, by providing process information extraction during resource monitoring and by associating resource usage with the top processes, to identify anomalous cases. In this article, we focus on anomalies such as hardware failures or software bugs that could lead to abnormal application runs, without necessarily stopping system functionality, e.g., due to a system crash, but by affecting its performance, e.g., decreased database system throughput. Although different patterns may occur through time, we focus on periodic running workloads (e.g., monitoring daily usage) that are very common for NoSQL systems, and Internet of Things scenarios where data streams are forwarded to the Cloud for storage and processing. We apply various machine learning algorithms such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal ARIMA, and long-short-term memory recurrent neural networks.

WoS,Cross-Network Fusion and Scheduling for Heterogeneous Networks in Smart Factory,"In the context of Industry 4.0, extensive deployment and application of advanced manufacturing equipment and various sensors is leading to a growing demand for data exchange between different devices. In smart factories, network transmission has multiprotocol features of wired/wireless communication, and different data flows have different real-time requirements. In this article, a heterogeneous network architecture based on software-defined network is proposed for realizing cross-network flexible forwarding of multisource manufacturing data and optimized utilization of network resources. Subsequently, the mechanism of cross-network fusion and scheduling (CNFS) is analyzed from the perspective of high dynamic characteristics and different delay requirements of data flows. Based on this analysis, a route-aware data flow dynamic reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm improves the efficiency of manufacturing data cross-network fusion, especially for multivariety and small-batch intelligent manufacturing systems. Furthermore, for meeting the bandwidth requirements of different delay flows, a delay-sensitive network bandwidth scheduling algorithm is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CNFS mechanism is verified using a candy packaging intelligent production line prototype platform.",Heterogeneous networks; Real-time systems; Bandwidth; Job shop scheduling; Smart manufacturing; Computer architecture; Cross-network fusion; heterogeneous networks; network resource scheduling; smart factory; software-defined network (SDN),"Wan, JF; Yang, J; Wang, SY; Li, D; Li, P; Xia, M",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS,10.1109/TII.2019.2952669,"[Wan, Jiafu; Yang, Jun; Wang, Shiyong; Li, Di] South China Univ Technol, Sch Mech & Automot Engn, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Peng] OWL Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Inst Ind IT, D-32657 Lemgo, Germany; [Xia, Min] Univ Lancaster, Dept Engn, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,1551-3203,
WoS,Geometrical constrained independent component analysis for hyperspectral unmixing,"One of the limitations of the hyperspectral remote sensing application is the existence of mixed pixels in image data. Spectral decomposition, which separates the mixed pixels into a set of endmember spectra and abundance fractions, is the most effective way to solve the mixed pixel problem. Due to the independence of source signals, independent component analysis (ICA) has been developed for hyperspectral unmixing by adding auxiliary constraints. Abundance sum-to-one and nonnegative constraints are two obvious features for hyperspectral data. In this paper, by processing these two constraints sequentially from the geometrical point of view to restrain the sum-to-one constraint thoroughly at each iteration, geometrical constrained ICA (GCICA) is proposed based on treating the abundance distribution as the independent signal. To validate the proposed algorithm, the synthetic data, and real image data are used for unmixing, respectively. Synthetic data are generated based on spectra from the ENVI (Environment for Visualizing Images) software spectral library. The real images are used with three hyperspectral datasets, AVIRIS (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) Cuprite dataset, AVIRIS Indiana Pine dataset and HYDICE (Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment) dataset. Results, in comparison with previously proposed algorithms, show that the proposed method has better performance for the decomposition of hyperspectral data in abundance and endmember spectral extraction, thus providing a new and effective method for spectral unmixing and signal separation without prior information.",,"Chen, SB; Cao, YJ; Chen, L; Guo, XL",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,10.1080/01431161.2020.1750732,"[Chen, Shengbo; Cao, Yijing] Jilin Univ, Coll Geoexplorat Sci & Technol, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lei] Tianjin Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, 393 Binshui West St, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xulin] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Geog & Planning, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,English,0143-1161,

For the visual analysis, Transient System Simulation Tool and Radiance were coupled. A south oriented office within the Abbey of San Lorenzo ad Septimum, located in Aversa (southern Italy), was considered for the simulations. The simulations were performed considering five window control strategies, two liquid crystal based electrical-driven glazing (able to switch faster than 1 s from an opaque to a transparent state) and two simulation switching times (1 h and 15 min). The simulation results associated with the electric -driven windows were compared to those obtained for a conventional double Low-E glazing window, highlighting that: (i) the use of the examined dynamic glazing can help to improve both the energy efficiency as well as the internal visual comfort, (ii) the effects of the control strategy are strongly related to the thermal and visual characteristics of the dynamic window and (iii) by reducing the switching time of the window, it is possible to improve the energy saving as well as the comfort inside the office.",Electric-driven smart window; Energy and environmental analysis; Visual performance; TRNSYS; Radiance,"Scorpio, M; Ciampi, G; Rosato, A; Maffei, L; Masullo, M; Almeida, M; Sibilio, S",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101398,"[Scorpio, Michelangelo; Ciampi, Giovanni; Rosato, Antonio; Maffei, Luigi; Masullo, Massimiliano; Sibilio, Sergio] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Architecture & Ind Design, I-81031 Aversa, CE, Italy; [Almeida, Manuela] Univ Minho UMinho, Sch Engn, CTAC, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal",ELSEVIER,English,2352-7102,

The change in cementite volume fraction and size was determined from samples heat treated for different durations at 840 degrees C and 1050 degrees C. The SEM micrographs were analyzed by using ImageJ software to count size and volume fraction of carbides. The obtained statistical data were used to draw the dissolution curves with a nonlinear curve fitting method. It was found that the cementite dissolution rate is fast at the beginning of partial and full austenitization. A model was established and carbide dissolution was calculated using DICTRA software. The dissolution curves were obtained and compared with the DICTRA simulations. The calculation results are in good agreement with the dissolution curves from statistical results of SEM micrographs.

WoS,Sparse thermal data for cellular automata modeling of grain structure in additive manufacturing,"Grain growth in the wake of the melt pool formed during alloy-based additive manufacturing (AM) is complex and multifaceted, depending on parameters governing heat transport, fluid flow, and solidification itself. Cellular automata (CA) models have proven effective in providing computationally efficient and physically sound predictions of grain structure for several AM problems, but their efficiency is tied to the performance of heat transport models. CA models use only a small portion of the problem's temperature data (near the moving melt pool boundary), and much of the CA calculations do not affect the final result due to re-melting of material. Coupling of and communication between heat transport and solidification models, and eliminating operations irrelevant towards final grain structure prediction, will be necessary for using these methods for efficient simulation of large parts. We introduce a procedure of decoupling the CA from temperature field simulation, using files of relevant temperature data written by the heat transport model. This approach is validated against the standard coupling approach using data obtained through the computational fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM. Negligible differences are seen in grain size, volume, and texture distributions for multilayer simulation of test problems, while the quantity of temperature data for these test problems was reduced by four orders of magnitude (from 100s of GB to 10s of MB) and the code performance sped up by a factor of around 50. Variability in microstructure as a function of cell size, substrate, time step, and nucleation parameters is studied, and it is found that cell sizes less than or equal to 1.67 mu m and sufficiently small time steps yield statistically equivalent microstructures. Finally, a potential use case for this CA approach-the layer-wise convergence in grain structure starting from extremes in initial grain size-is examined. This approach's ability to simulate expected trends in nucleation and epitaxial grain growth for large regions of microstructure, simulated independently of heat transport models themselves, should prove useful for investigation of various microstructure uncertainties and prediction of part-scale experimental results.",additive manufacturing; cellular automata; alloy solidification,"Rolchigo, M; Stump, B; Belak, J; Plotkowski, A",2020.0,Journal,MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,10.1088/1361-651X/ab9734,"[Rolchigo, Matthew; Belak, James] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Stump, Benjamin; Plotkowski, Alex] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Mat Sci & Technol Div, Oak Ridge, TN USA",IOP PUBLISHING LTD,English,0965-0393,
WoS,Persona Perception Scale: Development and Exploratory Validation of an Instrument for Evaluating Individuals' Perceptions of Personas,"Although used in many domains, the evaluation of personas is difficult due to the lack of validated measurement instruments. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Persona Perception Scale (PPS), a survey instrument for evaluating how individuals perceive personas. We develop the scale by reviewing relevant literature from social psychology, persona studies, and Human-Computer Interaction to find relevant constructs and items for measuring persona perceptions. Following initial pilot testing, we conduct an exploratory validation of the scale with 412 respondents and find that the constructs and items of the scale perform satisfactorily for deployment. The research has implications for both academic researchers and persona developers. Using the PPS, researchers and designers can evaluate how different persona designs affect individual perceptions of personas, for example persona users' (e.g., designers, marketers, software developers) perceived credibility of the persona and their willingness to use it.

In order to investigate the buckling stability of the structures before each lateral impact, they are subjected to be compressive-axial loading. The rest of the structures first subjected under the axial-compressive loading, then in the next step, a compressive loading is applied to determine the effect of the impact on the compressive strength of the damaged structures. In the numerical analysis, the Abaqus software is used to modeling and performing the mentioned analysis. Finally, the comparison of the results shows that the effect of the lateral impact causes how many reductions will be occurred in the buckling strength.

WoS,Solid-fluid equilibrium measurements of benzene in methane and implications for freeze-out at LNG conditions,"Information about the solubility of benzene in light hydrocarbons is particularly important for the prediction of freeze-out risk in LNG production. Engineering models developed to predict this risk need to be tested against high quality experimental data covering a range of conditions to assess their validity. A visual high pressure sapphire cell, housed in a specialized cryogenic environmental chamber, was employed to measure the melting temperature of methane + benzene binary systems at temperatures from 120 K, pressures up to 22 MPa, and benzene concentrations ranging from 120 to 1012 parts per million (ppm) by mole. The results obtained were compared with literature data and the predictions of the thermodynamic model implemented in the software package ThermoFAST. These comparisons reveal that the literature data are in fact consistent with each other, and with the measurements and predictions made in this work, within their experimental scatter. ThermoFAST was able to represent the melting temperatures obtained for benzene concentrations of 1012 and 199 ppm with r.m.s deviations of 0.7 and 3.4 K, respectively. At 120 ppm and 6.3 MPa, the measured solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) temperature deviated from the ThermoFAST prediction by less than 2 K.

WoS,Preserving instance state during refactorings in live environments,"An important activity of software evolution consists in applying refactorings to enhance the quality of the code without changing its behaviour. Having a proper refactoring tool is a must-to in any professional development environment. In addition, live programming allows faster development than the usual edit-compile-debug process. During live programming sessions, the developer can directly manipulate instances and modify the state of the running program. However, when a complex refactoring is performed, instances may be corrupted (i.e., their state is lost). For example, when pushing an instance variable to a superclass there is a moment where the superclass does not have yet acquired the new instance variable and the subclass does not have it any more. It means that the value assigned to this instance variable in existing instances is lost after the refactoring. This problem is not anecdotal since 36% of the refactorings described in Fowler's catalogue corrupt instances when used in a live programming context. There is a need to manually migrate, regenerate or reload instances from persistent sources. This manual fix lowers the usefulness of live programming. In this context of live programming, we propose, AtomicRefactoring, a new solution based on Dynamic Software Update to preserve the state of the application after performing refactorings. We provide a working extension to the existing refactoring tool developed for the language Pharo (a new offspring inheriting from Smalltalk), allowing application developers to perform complex refactorings preserving the live state of the running program.

WoS,An SDN based framework for maximizing throughput and balanced load distribution in a Cloudlet network,"Although mobile devices have experienced voluminous proliferation throughout the last decade, there are limited resources in terms of their portable size. Such limitations could be mitigated by remote execution of the computation-intensive tasks to the cloud. By creating a cluster of servers (a.k.a. Cloudlets) to the network edge and close to the mobile devices, task offloading could be performed with a more acceptable delay in comparison with a cloud-based solution. Nevertheless, once the user requests mount, the resource constraints in a Cloudlet will lead to resource shortages. However, this challenge can be obviated using a network of Cloudlets for sharing their resources. This paper proposes a novel framework to optimally manage the resources and balance an equitable load across a network of Cloudlets via software-defined networking (SDN) techniques. To achieve this, firstly, the problem is considered as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model in order to balance the distribution of independent tasks offloaded from the mobile devices along with optimal use of resources. The MILP model guarantees meeting the tasks' deadlines and maximizes overall system throughput. Secondly, by showing that the addressed problem is NP-hard, an LP-relaxation model is proposed to enable the SDN controller on a large-scale network. Finally, we conduct experiments by emulating the proposed framework in Mininet-WiFi, with the Floodlight usage as the SDN controller. The simulation results indicate that the proposed architecture can achieve a significant throughput maximization of a system, which satisfactorily performs load balancing, and offers adequate proof, as well.

WoS,Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at the Exascale,"Domain science applications and workflow processes are currently forced to view the network as an opaque infrastructure into which they inject data and hope that it emerges at the destination with an acceptable Quality of Experience. There is little ability for applications to interact with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a model-based architecture, implementation, and deployment which enables automated end-to-end network service instantiation across administrative domains. An intent based interface allows applications to express their high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource control systems allow for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time responsiveness based on individual application and infrastructure operator requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education infrastructures. Key contributions of this work include an architecture definition, reference implementation, and deployment. This provides the basis for further innovation of smart network services to accelerate scientific discovery in the era of big data, cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

WoS,Flux: Overcoming scheduling challenges for exascale workflows,"Many emerging scientific workflows that target high-end HPC systems require complex interplay with the resource and job management software (RJMS). However, portable, efficient and easy-to-use scheduling and execution of these workflows is still an unsolved problem. We present Flux, a novel, hierarchical RJMS infrastructure that addresses the key scheduling challenges of modern workflows in a scalable, easy-to-use, and portable manner. At the heart of Flux lies its ability to be seamlessly nested within batch allocations created by other schedulers as well as itself. Once a hierarchy of Flux instances is created within each allocation, its consistent and rich set of well-defined APIs portably and efficiently support those workflows that can often feature non-traditional execution patterns such as requirements for complex co-scheduling, massive ensembles of small jobs and coordination among jobs in an ensemble. Our evaluation of Flux on some of the emerging workflow efforts at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory indicates that our approach can significantly address major workflow scheduling challenges: job throughput, co-scheduling, job coordination and communication and portability challenges. Further, our performance evaluation on both synthetic and real-world ensemble-based workflows suggest that our solution can improve the job throughput performance of these scientific workflows by a factor of 48.

WoS,Secure software placement and configuration,"Finding the best way to place the components of an application on a set of heterogeneous servers is a challenging task, especially if some components are associated with security requirements. To address security requirements, several security controls may be available, some of them software-based (e.g., encryption), others hardware-based (e.g., trusted execution environments). Security controls may incur widely varying performance overhead. There is a non-trivial interplay between application placement (which component to place on which server) and the configuration of security controls (which security control to activate for which component). On the one hand, placing a component on a secure server may make it unnecessary to use software-based security controls for the component. On the other hand, the overhead of using a specific security control may increase the resource requirements of a component so that it does not fit onto its designated server. Therefore, this paper addresses the joint problem of application placement and configuration of security controls. We formalize the problem and use mixed integer quadratic programming to solve it. A case study is used to demonstrate that the proposed approach can automatically determine the placement and configuration of complex applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Implementation-independent function reuse,"Functions are essential building blocks of information retrieval and information management. However, efforts implementing these functions are fragmented: one function has multiple implementations, within specific development contexts. This inhibits reuse: metadata of functions and associated implementations need to be found across various search interfaces, and implementation integration requires human interpretation and manual adjustments. An approach is needed, independent of development context and enabling description and exploration of functions and (automatic) instantiation of associated implementations. In this paper, after collecting scenarios and deriving corresponding requirements, we (i) propose an approach that facilitates functions' description, publication, and exploration by modeling and publishing abstract function descriptions and their links to concrete implementations; and (ii) enable implementations' automatic instantiation by exploiting those published descriptions. This way, we can link to existing implementations, and provide a uniform detailed search interface across development contexts. The proposed model (the Function Ontology) and the publication method following the Linked Data principles using standards, are deemed sufficient for this task, and are extensible to new development contexts. The proposed set of tools (the Function Hub and Function Handler) are shown to fulfill the collected requirements, and the user evaluation proves them being perceived as a valuable asset during software retrieval. Our work thus improves developer experience for function exploration and implementation instantiation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,A machine learning approach to online fault classification in HPC systems,"As High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems strive towards the exascale goal, failure rates both at the hardware and software levels will increase significantly. Thus, detecting and classifying faults in HPC systems as they occur and initiating corrective actions before they can transform into failures becomes essential for continued operation. Central to this objective is fault injection, which is the deliberate triggering of faults in a system so as to observe their behavior in a controlled environment. In this paper, we propose a fault classification method for HPC systems based on machine learning. The novelty of our approach rests with the fact that it can be operated on streamed data in an online manner, thus opening the possibility to devise and enact control actions on the target system in real-time. We introduce a high-level, easy-to-use fault injection tool called FINJ, with a focus on the management of complex experiments. In order to train and evaluate our machine learning classifiers, we inject faults to an in-house experimental HPC system using FINJ, and generate a fault dataset which we describe extensively. Both FINJ and the dataset are publicly available to facilitate resiliency research in the HPC systems field. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach allows almost perfect classification accuracy to be reached for different fault types with low computational overhead and minimal delay.

WoS,Classification of hand movements using variational mode decomposition and composite permutation entropy index with surface electromyogram signals,"Research of human hand movements recognition can be applied to artificial limb control, motion recognition of wearable exoskeleton, human-computer interaction in virtual reality and so on. Surface Electromyogram (sEMG) signal is the preferred source. There are many researches on how to extract information from sEMG signal and apply it to human motion recognition. However, how to extract the feature signal from sEMG signal is a difficult problem in the research of human hand movement recognition based on sEMG signal. In this paper, a method based on Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and composite permutation entropy index (CPEI) method is proposed for hand motion classification. Previously, the VMD method had not been used in human hand motion recognition studies. The method proposed in this work applies the VMD method to decompose the original sEMG signal into multiple Variational Mode Functions (VMFs) and calculate the corresponding CPEI of each signal component. Three feature selection methods (Infinite Latent Feature Selection (ILFS), ReliefF, and Laplacian Score) were applied to rank the features and remove the unimportant features. Three classifiers (Naive Bayes, K-NN, and Bagging) were used to recognize the hand actions. Ten volunteers participated in the experiment, and the experimental data were used to verify the proposed method. The average accuracy was 94.28 +/- 1.26% for the proposed method with Laplacian Score for feature sorting and selection, and Bagging as classifier. Besides, 600 randomly selected hand movements are predicted (CPU is i5-8250U, ram is 8g, processing software is Spyder, python 3.7), and the corresponding execution time of proposed method is 0.56 s.

In this study, the influence of reinforcement detailing (including beam longitudinal reinforcement, beam transverse reinforcement, the angle of beam stirrups and column longitudinal reinforcement) on the displacement ductility and curvature ductility is numerically investigated. To achieve the study's objective, 25 RC beam-column joint models were developed in non-linear Finite Element software; three of them were verified by a similar experimental study conducted by Li et al. The reinforcement detailing was then changed to evaluate response of the joints. Results show that by increasing the longitudinal reinforcement of beam or decreasing the size of beam stirrup, both displacement ductility and curvature ductility decrease. Another notable conclusion is that decreasing the angle of beam stirrup or increasing the longitudinal reinforcement of a column can lead to an increase in curvature ductility and displacement ductility.",Reinforced concrete; Reinforcement detailing; Beam-column joint; Finite element; Displacement ductility; Curvature ductility,"Dabiri, H; Kaviani, A; Kheyroddin, A",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101333,"[Dabiri, Hamed] Univ Camerino, Sch Sci & Technol, Camerino, Italy; [Kaviani, Ahmad] Semnan Univ, Fac Struct Engn, Semnan, Iran; [Kheyroddin, Ali] Semnan Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Semnan, Iran",ELSEVIER,English,2352-7102,

Function alteration together with being in a deteriorated state augments the energy consumption problem.

WoS,Level-set methods applied to the kinematic wave equation governing surface water flows,"Critical issues arising from the governing nonlinear equations in surface water hydrodynamic include discontinuities in water surface levels, blow-up of water surface gradient, and treatment of dry beds or zero water depths, involving mathematical problems related to functional regularities of unknown variables such as the water depth. The level-set method is a powerful approach to relax requirements for functional regularities of unknowns in nonlinear partial differential equations of first order. In this study, the level-set method is applied to the one-dimensional kinematic wave equation, resulting in a linear level-set equation of the first order in a two-dimensional space to tackle dry beds. The zeros of the level-set function represent the water depths. Hypothesizing that the level-set function is continuous in the domain, it is numerically computed with a characteristic method. The development of overturning is regulated with singular viscosity regularization (SVR), whose effect is to relocate the zeros of the level-set function close to the exact positions of the shock fronts in dam-break problems. The method is firstly verified with the explicitly known exact solutions of primitive dam-break problems, optimizing a parameter of SVR. Then, abrupt water release from Chan Thnal Reservoir, Kampong Speu Province, Cambodia into an initially dry bed of its irrigation canal system is simulated as a practical demonstrative example.

WoS,Motion simulation and performance analysis of two-body floating point absorber wave energy converter,"As an important structure for utilizing wave energy, the two-body floating point absorber (FPA) wave energy converter has a simple structure, high energy conversion rate, and wide frequency response range. In this paper, a heave motion model of two-body FPA wave energy converter was established. On this basis, the secondary development of AQWA software programming in Fortran language was conducted by reckoning in the power take-off (PTO) effect, and the motion simulation of the two-body FPA wave energy converter was realized. For the specific oscillating two-body FPA model, the study analysed the frequency domain hydrodynamic performance and the time domain motion characteristics of the device. The results showed that the numerical model was adequate to predict the motion performance of the two-body FPA. The maximum value of the heaving response amplitude operator (RAO) was reached with the frequency of 0.7-0.8 rad/s. As the wave period increased, the generated power of the two-body FPA initially increased and subsequently decreased. The stiffness coefficient has less effect on the generated power than the damping coefficient. The results and conclusions have reference significance for the development of new wave energy devices and the efficient and reliable utilization of wave energy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Biodiesel production from Ethiopian 'Besana'- Croton macrostachyus seed: Characterization and optimization,"The study explores the potential of the Croton macrostachyus seed, a non-edible feedstock found in abundance in the southeastern parts of Ethiopia, for the production of biodiesel. Soxhlet extractor was used to extract, 53.34% of the oil from the Croton macrostachyus seed. This oil was further purified and the resulting product was known as the purified Croton macrostachyus seed (P-CMS) oil. After obtaining the P-CMS oil, biodiesel was produced by the transesterification process. Focus was made on the optimization of biodiesel production by varying the identified process parameters, through the Box- Behnken Design using response surface methodology (RSM) (Design-Expert (R) Version 11 software). The crude biodiesel was purified, characterized and complied with the ASTM D6751, United States and the EN 14214, European Union standards. The optimum conversion efficiency of the P-CMS oil to fatty acid methyl ether (FAME) was 96% at the optimal conditions (6:1, methanol to oil ratio; 1%, catalyst loading; 50 degrees C, reaction temperature). A plan for the environmental impact assessment and life cycle assessment were provided to evaluate the sustainability of this new feedstock and the biodiesel produced from it. Results of these studies indicated the prospective of Croton macrostachyus seed as a new biodiesel feedstock. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a digital alpha-particle spectrometer, compatible with the low-cost digitizers, was designed and constructed. Similar to the analog pulse-height analyses, the digital signals must also be carefully shaped. Here, the charge pulses induced by alpha particles were measured in a silicon PIN-diode detector. Then, a digital sparsity-based pulse-processor was introduced for shaping the charge signals that were digitized by a low sampling rate digitizer. To this end, a charge-sensitive pre-amplifier was designed and fabricated for coupling to the digitizers. To perform off-line analysis, the detector pulses were stored through a combination of a fast-digital oscilloscope and the LabVIEW software. Finally, the pulse-height spectrum was obtained by a digital multi-channel analyzer block. The performance of the designed filter was examined for Ra-226 alpha spectrum by comparing its output with those of other conventional filters.

Furthermore, they are subjected to backflow lightning overvoltages due to the installation in high soil resistivity areas, however, such the study is not aforementioned well in the literature. Therefore, the analyses and reductions of backflow lightning overvoltages are investigated in this paper, considering a PV power plant as an example installed in Taif city, KSA. All PV plant components are modeled using high-frequency models, in which they are such as air-termination, grounding system, surge protective devices, PV string, inverters, underground cables, and power transformers. To decrease the lightning overvoltages in the PV power plant, a modified PV grounding system design is introduced and evaluated. The evaluation is performed considering step voltage profiles using COMSOL Multiphysics and backflow lightning overvoltage magnitudes at different points in PV plant using ATP/EMTP.

The main plate examined has four layers carbon/epoxy and the stiffeners composed of carbon/epoxy face sheets and polypropylene honeycomb core. The experimental and theoretical studies are carried out in order to investigate the effect of sandwich stiffeners on the dynamic response of laminated composite plates under the blast load. In the theoretical study, the equations of motion of the stiffened laminated composite plate are derived by the use of virtual work principle. Geometric nonlinearities are modelled by taking von Karman Large Deformation Theory into account for the sandwich plate. The clamped boundary conditions are considered for all edges of the plate. The equations of motion are discretized into the time domain by using Galerkin's method.

WoS,Stress Wave Propagation and Structural Response of Precast Concrete Segmental Columns under Simulated Blast Loads,"Although a number of precast concrete segmental columns (PCSC) have been built and developed in recent years owing to their various advantages, the dynamic responses of the column under blast loads are not well investigated. The characteristics of stress wave propagation within the column and their effects on the response and failure of the PCSC are still unknown. Understanding blast load induced stress wave propagation and the subsequent dynamic structural responses of PCSC is essential for blast resistant design and protection of PCSC. In this study the dynamic behaviours of the PCSC under blast loads are numerically investigated by using the explicit finite element software LS-DYNA. The numerical models and modelling techniques are carefully validated by three experimental blast tests from three different studies. The stress wave propagation within the cross-section and along the column height caused by blast loads is examined. The effect of steel tubes in protecting the PCSC from the blast loads is also investigated. It is found that the deformation of the column section under blast loads consists of two main phases, i.e. compression phase and expansion phase, in which failure of the concrete segment mostly occurs in the latter phase. Besides, the use of steel tubes has a marginal influence during the compression phase on the concrete section, but it becomes crucial in the expansion phase that the local failure of concrete segment, i.e. spalling and scabbing, is prevented by the confining effect. Furthermore, confining all concrete segments by steel tubes shifts the response of the PCSC from the local failure of the concrete segment to the global flexural response with fracture of the post-tensioned tendon. The influence of the blast location on the response of the column is also investigated in this study.",Stress wave propagation; Blast load; Segmental columns; Dynamic responses; CFST,"Do, TV; Pham, TM; Hao, H",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2020.103595,"[Do, Tin, V] Karagozian & Case Australia Pty Ltd, Bondi Jct, NSW 2022, Australia; [Do, Tin, V; Pham, Thong M.; Hao, Hong] Curtin Univ, Ctr Infrastruct Monitoring & Protect, Sch Civil & Mech Engn, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0734-743X,

The relationship of normal stress and normal velocity on the surface of the projectile nose was modified based on the assumption that the shape of the tunnel section is the same as that of the projectile. Then, in the low velocity range, a formula for predicting the final penetration depth of the pyramidal projectile is proposed, and the penetration ability of pyramidal projectiles with and without a shank is discussed. The results showed that the penetration depth decreases with the increasing side numbers of the projectile section shape, and the maximum depth of penetration corresponds to the triangular cross-section. In addition, the penetration processes of triangular and circular projectiles into concrete targets were simulated by employing the finite element software LS-DYNA. The Mises stress, tunnel shape, depth of penetration and velocity were investigated. It suggested the triangular projectile has a slight penetration advantage over the circular projectile when the penetration velocity is less than threshold velocity, and this advantage gradually disappears with the increase of impacting velocity. Finally, the shear weakening effect is used to explain the resistance characteristics of the triangular projectile in various velocity ranges, and a method to estimate the upper limit of threshold velocity is given by using the dynamic cavity expansion theory.",Non-circular projectile; Dynamic cavity expansion; Resistance characteristics; High-speed penetration,"Dong, H; Wu, HJ; Liu, ZH; Gao, XD; Pi, AG; Li, JZ; Huang, FL",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2020.103583,"[Dong, Heng; Wu, Haijun; Pi, Aiguo; Li, Jinzhu; Huang, Fenglei] Beijing Inst Technol, State Key Lab Explos Sci & Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zihao] China Shipbldg Informat Ctr, Dept Int Maritime Affairs & Standardisat Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gao, Xudong] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0734-743X,
WoS,"Gamma-ray shielding properties of phosphate glasses containing Bi2O3, PbO, and BaO in different rates","Glass-based materials are one of the most common shielding materials. Phosphate glasses have unique properties that make them useful for some technical and industrial applications. The mass attenuation coefficients (mu(m)), effective atomic cross sections (sigma(a)), effective atomic numbers and electron densities (Z(eff) and N-eff) of phosphate glasses containing different concentrations of Bi2O3, PbO, and BaO (30-70% by weight) have been determined in the energy range of 10 keV-10 MeV. To calculate these parameters, XCOM and XMuDat computer programs and also the Auto-Z(eff) software and interpolation method have been used. The results of XCOM, XMuDat and Auto-Z(eff) programs were in good agreement. It was found that the mu(m) and sigma(a) parameters decrease as the photon energy increase. Also, the sigma(a) and Z(eff) values improve by increasing the Bi2O3, PbO and BaO contents, while increasing these contents to the same fraction has no significant effect on mu(m) in the energy range of 0.4-4 MeV, where the Compton Effect takes over as dominant process.

WoS,Commercial filament testing for use in 3D printed phantoms,"There is a great demand for phantoms by many areas of knowledge to be used for teaching or daily work. However, commercial phantoms are expensive and hard to obtain, especially in countries going through development. As an alternative, 3D printing can be the way to produce less expensive and reliable 3D phantoms. The goal of this study is to evaluate 14 available commercial filaments, in order to find if and how they can be used in 3D printed phantoms in computed tomography. Each material was printed as a 2 cm edge cube with rectilinear pattern and 60, 80 and 100% infill. The 80% infill of five other patterns were also printed and compared. Each 100% infill cube was weighted and had its density calculated. After that, the cubes were scanned in a Philips CT Brilliance 6 with 120 kVp, 200 mA, 2 mm slices and standard reconstruction. At the center of each cube, a similar to 120 mm(2) region of interest was set to measure the mean Hounsfield Unit (HU) and its standard deviation. The software Origin was used to plot HU results for rectilinear pattern, determine linear trends with its R-2 and compare achieved values with HU tissue range from literature. To confirm the response of HU values of selected tested materials in CT imaging as a function of percentage infill, a phantom prototype of a finger was 3D printed. The HU of the tested materials ranged from -516.2 +/- 7.3 to 329.8 +/- 18.9. All human tissues could be mimicked making use of these materials, except cortical bone above similar to 350 HU and tooth parts.

WoS,PittPack: An open-source Poisson's equation solver for extreme-scale computing with accelerators,"We present a parallel implementation of a direct solver for Poisson's equation on extreme-scale supercomputers with accelerators. We introduce a chunked-pencil decomposition as the domain-decomposition strategy to distribute work among processing elements to achieve improved scalability at high counts of accelerators. Chunked-pencil decomposition enables overlapping MPI communication and data transfer between the central processing units (CPUs) and the graphics processing units (GPUs). It enables contiguous message transfer among the nodes and improves data locality by keeping neighboring elements in adjacent memory locations while permitting the use of shared memory for certain segments of the algorithm when possible. We study two different communication patterns within the chunked-pencil decomposition. The first pattern fully overlaps the communication with data transfer and aims to speedup the overall turnaround time. The second pattern concentrates on low memory usage and is more network friendly than the first pattern for computations at extreme scale. In our parallel implementation, we interleave OpenACC with MPI to support computations on the GPU or the CPU. The numerical solution and its formal second order of accuracy is verified using the method of manufactured solutions for various combinations of boundary conditions. Additionally, we used PittPack within an incompressible flow solver to further validate its accuracy and as well as demonstrate its versatility as a software package.

WoS,Evolutionary multi-objective optimization and Pareto-frontal uncertainty quantification of interatomic forcefields for thermal conductivity simulations,"Predictive Molecular Dynamics simulations of thermal transport require forcefields that can simultaneously reproduce several structural, thermodynamic and vibrational properties of materials like lattice constants, phonon density of states, and specific heat. This requires a multi-objective optimization approach for forcefield parameterization. Existing methodologies for forcefield parameterization use ad-hoc and empirical weighting schemes to convert this into a single-objective optimization problem. Here, we provide and describe software to perform multi-objective optimization of Stillinger-Weber forcefields (SWFF) for two-dimensional layered materials using the recently developed 3rd generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III). NSGA-III converges to the set of optimal forcefields lying on the Pareto front in the multi-dimensional objective space. This set of forcefields is used for uncertainty quantification of computed thermal conductivity due to variability in the forcefield parameters. We demonstrate this new optimization scheme by constructing a SWFF for a representative two-dimensional material, 2H-MoSe2 and quantifying the uncertainty in their computed thermal conductivity.

WoS,Tight-Binding Studio: A technical software package to find the parameters of tight-binding Hamiltonian,"We present the Tight-Binding Studio (TB Studio) software package that calculates the different parameters of a tight-binding Hamiltonian from a set of Bloch energy bands obtained from first principle theories such as density functional theory, Hartree-Fock calculations or semi-empirical band-structure theory. This will be helpful for scientists who are interested in studying electronic and optical properties of structures using Green's function theory within the tight-binding approximation. TB Studio is a cross-platform application written in C++ with a graphical user interface design that is user-friendly and easy to work with. This software is powered by Linear Algebra Package C interface library for solving the eigenvalue problems and the standard high performance OpenGL graphic library for real time plotting.

WoS,freud: A software suite for high throughput analysis of particle simulation data,"The freud Python package is a library for analyzing simulation data. Written with modern simulation and data analysis workflows in mind, freud provides a Python interface to fast, parallelized C++ routines that run efficiently on laptops, workstations, and supercomputing clusters. The package provides the core tools for finding particle neighbors in periodic systems, and offers a uniform API to a wide variety of methods implemented using these tools. As such, freud users can access standard methods such as the radial distribution function as well as newer, more specialized methods such as the potential of mean force and torque and local crystal environment analysis with equal ease. Rather than providing its own trajectory data structure, freud operates either directly on NumPy arrays or on trajectory data structures provided by other Python packages. This design allows freud to transparently interface with many trajectory file formats by leveraging the file parsing abilities of other trajectory management tools. By remaining agnostic to its data source, freud is suitable for analyzing any particle simulation, regardless of the original data representation or simulation method. When used for on-the-fly analysis in conjunction with scriptable simulation software such as HOOMD-blue, freud enables smart simulations that adapt to the current state of the system, allowing users to study phenomena such as nucleation and growth.

Certain more standardized techniques - including correlation functions, order parameters, and clustering - are computationally intensive tasks that must be carefully implemented to scale to the larger systems common in modern simulations. Solution method: freud performs a wide variety of particle system analyses, offering a Python API that interfaces with many other tools in computational molecular sciences via NumPy array inputs and outputs. The algorithms in freud leverage parallelized C++ to scale to large systems and enable real-time analysis. The library's broad set of features encode few assumptions compared to other analysis packages, enabling analysis of a broader class of data ranging from biomolecular simulations to colloidal experiments.

WoS,ExaHyPE: An engine for parallel dynamically adaptive simulations of wave problems,"ExaHyPE (An Exascale Hyperbolic PDE Engine) is a software engine for solving systems of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Hyperbolic PDEs are typically derived from the conservation laws of physics and are useful in a wide range of application areas. Applications powered by ExaHyPE can be run on a student's laptop, but are also able to exploit thousands of processor cores on state-of-the-art supercomputers. The engine is able to dynamically increase the accuracy of the simulation using adaptive mesh refinement where required. Due to the robustness and shock capturing abilities of ExaHyPE's numerical methods, users of the engine can simulate linear and non-linear hyperbolic PDEs with very high accuracy. Users can tailor the engine to their particular PDE by specifying evolved quantities, fluxes, and source terms. A complete simulation code for a new hyperbolic PDE can often be realised within a few hours - a task that, traditionally, can take weeks, months, often years for researchers starting from scratch. In this paper, we showcase ExaHyPE's workflow and capabilities through real-world scenarios from our two main application areas: seismology and astrophysics.

An a-posteriori limiting approach is applied to the ADER-DG solution, whereby spurious solutions are discarded and recomputed with a robust, patch-based finite volume scheme.

WoS,A MATLAB tool for computing the spherical harmonic fractal dimension of the cerebral cortex,"Fractal dimension (FD) has become a very useful tool in neuroscience with a wide range of applications in characterizing several neurodegenerative diseases. The most commonly used method for computing the FD of brain tissues is box-counting. This technique performs very well on 2D images and 3D volumes; however, it presents several drawbacks when processing cortical surfaces in 3D. In this study, we present a MATLAB program for computing the FD of 3D surfaces based on spherical harmonics. We developed a novel MATLAB program, called UJA-SHFD, based on a spherical harmonics FD algorithm which overcomes the limitations of the classical box-counting algorithm when processing 3D surfaces. Moreover, spherical-harmonic-based FD (SHFD) enables the processing of both global (providing a single FD value for the entire surface) and local level assessments in each cortical surface vertex. UJA-SHFD has been specifically designed and tested for processing cortical surfaces obtained from the FreeSurfer software suite. Nevertheless, the program can also process any kind of surface in the Wavefront OBJ format. UJA-SHFD can be used both through a graphical user interface and at the command line. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of UJA-SHFD through its application to a neuroimaging study looking at the progression of brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. UJA-SHFD is a novel MATLAB program with the goal of developing neuroimaging analyses of FD computation for the investigation of brain morphological changes in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. The MATLAB source code of UJA-SHFD is freely available.

WoS,Energy performance and cost analysis for the nZEB retrofit of a typical UK hotel,"It is commonly known that commercial buildings contribute to a large proportion of energy consumption nationally and across Europe. The introduction of 'nearly zero energy buildings' (nZEBs) by the Energy Performance Building Directive [Recast] in 2010 has meant that a variety of active measures must be undertaken by the construction industry to define, shape, and meet the standard for both residential and commercial buildings. Hotels are typically ranked amongst the top five energy consumers in the tertiary sector. However, energy saving potential within the hotel industry is also significant. The aim of this study is to present an energy performance analysis and identify the primary energy consumption (PEC) level, post-retrofit, which could represent the cost-optimal level for a UK nZEB-hotel. Thermal Analysis Simulation software (Tas) is used to validate and assess the energy performance of the building pre- and post-retrofit. TasGenOpt is used to select individual EEMs that meet the nZEB targets and create the retrofit scenarios. Finally, building life cycle cost (BLCC) software is used to carry out the global cost calculations. It is found that whilst the nZEB target is technically feasible there is a 30% gap between the nZEB solution and the cost-optimal one. This is significant as it means that the current nZEB standard is not comparable to the best financial solution.

WoS,Flexibility Planning of Distributed Battery Energy Storage Systems in Smart Distribution Networks,"The deployment of batteries in the distribution networks can provide an array of flexibility services to integrate renewable energy sources (RES) and improve grid operation in general. Hence, this paper presents the problem of optimal placement and sizing of distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESSs) from the viewpoint of distribution system operator to increase the network flexibility. The problem is formulated as an optimization framework wherein the objective function is to minimize the annualized sum of investment costs and operational costs of DBESSs while it is constrained to power flow, DBESS and RES constraints as well as distribution network operation limits. In addition, while the problem model is as nonlinear programming, this paper suggests an equivalent linear programming model for all constraints and quadratic formulation for the objective function to reach the global optimal solution with low error calculation. In the next step, the Benders decomposition approach is deployed to acquire better calculation speed.

WoS,Predicting the air temperature of a building zone by detecting different configurations using a switched system identification technique,"Considerable efforts have been made to find a reliable model able to accurately describe and predict the thermal behavior of the indoor environment of a building. Such a model is essential, in particular, for designing climate control strategies for optimizing both the comfort level and the energy consumption. However, a building is a complex system characterized by a nonlinear thermal behavior, so the task to find such a reliable model is rather difficult. This paper aims at overcoming some of these difficulties by presenting a data driven approach based on a switched system identification to detect and model the thermal behavior of a building zone during normal usage. The proposed technique relies on a PieceWise AutoRegressive model with eXogeneous inputs (PWARX) consisting of a set of sub-models with each one of them describing a certain configuration/state of the dwelling, e.g. turning the heating ON/OFF or opening/closing windows, doors and shutters. The approach is data-driven, easy to implement and its computational time is inferior to creating a detailed model under a specialized software. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for providing a quick description of the thermal behavior of existing buildings for which it is possible to install sensors and perform measurements. Using the available measurements, the algorithm is able to detect various configurations as will be shown by two numerical examples. Such a collection of sub-models provides a better temperature estimate than using ARX models, so it will eventually allow to select better strategies for improving energy efficiency.",Building thermal modeling; System identification; Hybrid model; PWARX,"Ajib, B; Lefteriu, S; Caucheteux, A; Lecoeuche, S",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100995,"[Ajib, Balsam; Lefteriu, Sanda; Lecoeuche, Stephane] Univ Lille, IMT Lille Douai, Unite Rech Informat Automat, F-59000 Lille, France; [Caucheteux, Antoine] Cerema DTer Ouest DLRCA, 23 Ave Amiral Chauvin, F-49136 Le Ponts De Ce, France",ELSEVIER,English,2352-7102,

Material and method: NGS analyses were performed on forty-one plasma samples from HIV-1 affected patients using the Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay (Vela-Diagnostics, Germany). This system comprises a semi-automated Ion torrent based platform and the sequencing results were analyzed based on ANRS, REGA and Stanford drug resistance algorithms. Phylogenetic analysis was analyzed based on https://comet.lih.lu database as well as MEGA5 Software. Results: Drug resistances were identified in thirty-three samples (80%) out of forty-one samples. The Phylogenetic analysis results showed that CRF-35AD (94%) and subtypes B (2.4%) and G (2.4%) were dominant subtypes in this study. NRTI and NNRTI associated dominant mutations were M184I/V and K103 N.High-level resistance to lamivudine (3 TC) and Emtricitabine (FTC) were detected in 34.3% of patients while 53.1% were resistant to Efavirenz (EFV) and Nevirapine (NVP). The Protease inhibitor (PI) minor and major mutations were not reported but more than 95% of samples had polymorphisms mutation in K20R, M36I, H69K, L89 M positions. These mutations are subtype dependent and completely are absent in subtype B virus. The secondary mutations were reported in positions of E157Q, 5230 N, and T97A of integrase gene and four samples represent low-level resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Conclusions: This is the first preliminary evaluation of HIV-1 drug resistance mutation (DRM) by using the Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay in Iran. The NGS represent a promising tool for the accurate detection of DRMs of CRF-35AD that is dominant subtype in Iranian HIV-1 infected population and for the first time revealed HIV-1 subtype G in Iranian population.

Traditionally unsupervised, it has received renewed attention recently as it has shown to produce better results when provided with new types of information, thus leading to a new kind of semi-supervised learning: constrained clustering. This technique is a generalization of traditional clustering that considers additional information encoded by constraints. Constraints can be given in the form of instance-level must-link and cannot-link constraints, which is the focus of this paper. We propose a new metaheuristic algorithm, the Dual Iterative Local Search, and prove its ability to produce quality results for the constrained clustering problem. We compare the results obtained by this proposal to those obtained by the state-of-the-art algorithms on 25 datasets with incremental levels of constraint-based information, supporting our conclusions with the aid of Bayesian statistical tests.

A novel operator based micromechanical modelling in conjunction with finite element formulation of hybrid composite is derived considering the modulus operator for fibre, matrix as well as filler particles.

These dynamic parameters are verified with free vibration experiments conducted using an impact hammer and an accelerometer connected to a device loaded with B&K PULSE software. The predicted results are found to be in good convergence with the experiments. Further, it is also observed that damping ratio increases while natural frequency decreases with increase in SiC content.

WoS,The role of microscale solid matrix compressibility on the mechanical behaviour of poroelastic materials,"We present the macroscale three-dimensional numerical solution of anisotropic Biot's poroelasticity, with coefficients derived from a micromechanical analysis as prescribed by the asymptotic homogenisation technique. The system of partial differential equations (PDEs) is discretised by finite elements, exploiting a formal analogy with the fully coupled thermal displacement systems of PDEs implemented in the commercial software Abaqus. The robustness of our computational framework is confirmed by comparison with the well-known analytical solution of the one-dimensional Therzaghi's consolidation problem. We then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations of the model in a sphere (representing a biological tissue) by applying a given constant pressure in the cavity. We investigate how the macroscale radial displacements (as well as pressures) profiles are affected by the microscale solid matrix compressibility (MSMC). Our results suggest that the role of the MSMC on the macroscale displacements becomes more and more prominent by increasing the length of the time interval during which the constant pressure is applied. As such, we suggest that parameter estimation based on techniques such as poroelastography (which are commonly used in the context of biological tissues, such as the brain, as well as solid tumours) should allow for a sufficiently long time in order to give a more accurate estimation of the mechanical properties of tissues.",Poroelasticity; Finite element method; Poroelastography; Asymptotic homogenisation; Multiscale modelling; Micromechanics,"Dehghani, H; Noll, I; Penta, R; Menzel, A; Merodio, J",2020.0,Journal,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS,10.1016/j.euromechsol.2020.103996,"[Dehghani, H.] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Med, Inst Computat Engn, 6 Ave Fonte, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Noll, I; Menzel, A.] TU Dortmund Univ, Inst Mech, Dept Mech Engn, Leonhard Euler Str 5, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany; [Penta, R.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Math & Stat, Math & Stat Bldg,Univ Pl, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Menzel, A.] Lund Univ, Div Solid Mech, POB 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Merodio, J.] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Mecan Medios Continuos & T Estruct, ETSI Caminos Canales & Puertos, Calle Prof Aranguren S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain",ELSEVIER,English,0997-7538,
WoS,A geologic model for lunar ice deposits at mining scales,"Water ice has been detected at the lunar poles, but existing and near-future orbital datasets do not have the capabilities to determine its horizontal and vertical distribution at meter to hundred-meter scales relevant for mining operations. Additionally, there has not yet been a coherent geologic model put forward for how ice deposits have formed and evolved that can be used to assist in planning prospecting campaigns or developing relevant hardware. Here, we propose a system model for understanding these deposits at scales of meters to hectares. The model considers sources of water ice, capture at and below the surface, and retention; it focuses heavily on impact gardening as a modifying process that drives changes in how ice is distributed. 3-dimensional stochastic impact simulations are then used to test the system model and explore how ice deposits might evolve over an area the size of a potential mining outpost. The simulation results showed ice concentrations should eventually become fairly homogeneous at meter to hectare scales due to impact gardening, and high concentrations are distributed randomly rather than clustered in Earth-like ore bodies. We found the best ice deposits for extracting likely exist 10s of cm deep or more, even in locations where ice is currently stable at the very surface. Terrestrial mining software was then used to create block models and grade/tonnage curves that can inform future in-situ resource utilization demonstration missions and future mining operations planning.",Moon; Ices; Regoliths,"Cannon, KM; Britt, DT",2020.0,Journal,ICARUS,10.1016/j.icarus.2020.113778,"[Cannon, Kevin M.; Britt, Daniel T.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Phys, 4111 Libra Dr,Phys Sci Bldg 430, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,English,0019-1035,
WoS,Experimental and Numerical Study of Bearing Capacity of Circular Footings on Layered Soils With and Without Skirted Sand Piles,"The present paper investigates the behaviour of circular shallow footings on soft clay soils with skirted and non-skirted sand piles. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the settlement and bearing capacity of a circular foundation, which is placed on a soft clay layer, based on a sandy soil layer. Different piles with varying length to clay layer thickness ratios ranging from 0.25 to 1 were modelled experimentally, as well as numerically, both with and without skirt. The effects of using a steel skirt and the length to clay layer thickness ratio of the piles, compared to the case in which the footing is placed on a pile without any skirt, and in the case of a shallow foundation without piles, were also investigated in this study. A model generated by finite element software was also used for numerical analysis. The results indicate that the use of skirted piles can affect the load-settlement curves and increase the bearing capacity. By increasing the ratio of pile length to clay thickness, the bearing capacity of the shallow foundation will be increased and the corresponding settlement will be decreased. Therefore, the bearing capacity failure mechanism of a footing resting on soft clay can be modified from the punching failure to the general shear failure at the tip of the confined replaced sand column. Load-settlement diagrams and bearing capacity obtained by numerical results are in accordance with the results derived from experimental observations.",Skirted pile; Bearing capacity; Circular footing; Soft clay soil; Experimental study; Numerical analysis,"Zeydi, H; Boushehrian, AH",2020.0,Journal,IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,10.1007/s40996-019-00284-w,"[Zeydi, H.] Islamic Azad Univ, Estahban Branch, Geotech Engn, Estahban, Iran; [Boushehrian, A.

WoS,Driving Time Prediction at Freeway Interchanges Using Artificial Neural Network and Particle Swarm Optimization,"Regarding the role of time in human life, the driving time can be a tangible criterion to represent the quality of flow in every traffic facility such as freeway interchanges. There are a lot of appreciable attempts which focused on determining travel time in long-length paths in the networks. But, there are not enough considerable studies on predicting the driving time in short-length paths such as the parts of an interchange. Besides, when the study area has to be changed, or when the purpose is to design a nonexistent interchange, predicting the driving time in diverse parts of an interchange cannot be carried out by direct measurement, and when there is information shortage on some hardly achievable traffic-based characteristics of interchanges, predicting the driving time by common procedures will be so hard or even impossible. Using simulation software usually needs considerable time and budget, too. In this paper, focus was on studying the short-length fragments of freeway interchanges to predict driving time by investigating ten real-world interchanges and more than 13,600 different simulated parts of interchanges. An artificial neural network (ANN)-based model and a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based model were developed, and therefore, predicting driving time was possible just based on basic simple traffic and geometrical properties of the interchange. The results of testing, validating, and statistical analysis depicted a proper and precise development of the models. Although the PSO-based models have higher RMSE values than ANN-based models, the models were reliable enough to use for predicting the driving time in four parts of interchanges.",Freeway interchange; Prediction model; Driving time; Artificial neural network; Particle swarm optimization,"Behbahani, H; Hosseini, SM; Samerei, SA; Taherkhani, A; Asadi, H",2020.0,Journal,IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,10.1007/s40996-019-00289-5,"[Behbahani, Hamid; Hosseini, Sayyed Mohsen; Samerei, Seyed Alireza; Taherkhani, Alireza; Asadi, Hemin] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, POB 13114-16846, Tehran, Iran",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,English,2228-6160,
WoS,A Semi-Supervised Meta-Heuristic Shell Form-Finding Approach,"This paper proposes a general semi-supervised form-finding approach for optimization of shells, where an initial geometry referred to as the Directive Form (DF) influences and directs the shape optimization process. The degree of the influence of the DF over the optimization process is controlled by the optimizer algorithm. A normal option involves stronger influence of DF within the early stages of the optimization process and a vanishing effect towards the later stages of the process. The method is illustrated through an example using the artificial intelligence for the optimization process. The selected problem is optimized with particle swarm optimization algorithm in MATLAB. The required structural analysis of the optimization steps is carried out by the finite element software SAP2000 which is linked up with the optimization algorithm via the application programming interface software. The coordinates of the nodes over the surface of the shell are selected as the optimization variables, and the semi-supervised algorithm finds the desired optimal form by minimizing the eccentricity of the forces as the target function. Finally, the paper presents a simple and workable stress calculation method for the optimized shells under gravitational loads.",Shell; Form finding; Optimization; Artificial intelligence; Shell calculation; Particle swarm intelligence,"Baghdadi, A; Heristchian, M; Kloft, H",2020.0,Journal,IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,10.1007/s40996-019-00264-0,"[Baghdadi, Abtin; Kloft, Harald] TU Braunschweig, Inst Struct Design, Dept Architecture Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Braunschweig, Germany; [Heristchian, Mahmoud] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, South Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,English,2228-6160,

The advances in electronic devices technologies lead to more powerful and lighter processors to be used in avionic systems which have attracted more attention to these UAVs. The first steps of utilizing an unmanned helicopter are dynamic modeling, control system design and performing model-in-the-loop (MIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests which are presented in this paper. In this research, MIL and HIL tests of an unmanned helicopter are done using novel Linux-based flight control system built on Raspberry Pi board (different from normally used PC-104 and STM- or Arduino-based systems).

WoS,Ti-6Al-4V TIG Weld Analysis Using FEM Simulation and Experimental Characterization,"This study involves thermal, metallurgical and mechanical analysis during tungsten inert gas welding of Ti-6Al-4V alloy aiming at optimizing the welding current to enhance the mechanical properties. Firstly, a 3D transient FEM simulation of TIG Ti-6Al-4V weld using ABAQUS software, based on a Gaussian distribution of power density in space, has been built to predict the effect of welding current on the heat input, weld bead geometry, temperature and residual stresses distribution across the welding line. Secondly, a validation of FEM with the experimentally measured temperature distribution and welding bead geometries has been presented. Finally, experimental study of the effect of TIG welding current, the suitable range predicted from FEM, on the microstructure, hardness and tensile strength of 12-mm-thick alloy plate is discussed. Using FEM, the suitable range of welding current was predicted to be 130-170 A. There was a close agreement among the experimental results and the FEM simulation data. It has been found that low welding current of 130 A results in high tensile strength and hardness of the welding joint. This is attributed to low heat input, high cooling rate and the formation of a fine grain structure containing martensite-phase with low values of residual stresses.",Ti-6Al-4V TIG weld; FEM simulation; Transient thermal analysis; Welding current; Microstructure; Mechanical properties,"Reda, R; Magdy, M; Rady, M",2020.0,Journal,IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING,10.1007/s40997-019-00287-y,"[Reda, Reham] Suez Univ, Fac Engn, Suez 43721, Egypt; [Magdy, Mohamed; Rady, Mohamed] Helwan Univ, Fac Engn, Helwan 11792, Egypt",SPRINGER,English,2228-6187,
WoS,Computational Investigation of Porous Media Combustion Technology in Spark Ignition Engine,"In the present work, computational fluid dynamics approach is adopted to study the possibility of using porous media in combustion and emission in a single-cylinder four-stroke spark ignition engine. The combustion behavior inside the engine without and with application of porous media is studied. The analysis with application of PM signifies enhanced combustion behavior. The compression ratio is kept at 7. Two different types of fluid computational domains are considered, namely, without and with PM. The three-dimensional modeling, meshing and simulations of the combustion chambers are performed with the ANSYS 17.1-FLUENT software. Thek-epsilon turbulence model, the premixed combustion model and the spark ignition model are used in the study. The parameters to be analyzed are the variation of cylinder pressure, temperature and turbulence at different crank angles. The results of the computational work without PM are validated with the experimental work, which is executed on the research engine setup operated in SI mode. The work is performed at different engine loads by varying the engine torque, viz. 6 Nm (25%), 12 Nm (50%), 18 Nm (75%) and 24 Nm (100%) along with the no-load condition. The analyses of the results indicate that the peak value of total pressure (1,986,868.99 Pa) and average value of total temperature (632.63 K) with PM at 100% load are lower than without PM (1,992,314.50 Pa and 604.81 K). The concentrations of NO(X)emissions are significantly reduced by the use of PM for all the loads. The percentage reductions in NO(X)emissions at no load, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, are found to be 2.5%, 11.1%, 9.4%, 9% and 2.12%, respectively.",Porous media; Spark ignition; Combustion; Load; Peclet number,"Sharma, D; Debnath, BK",2020.0,Journal,IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING,10.1007/s40997-019-00285-0,"[Sharma, Debojit; Debnath, Biplab Kumar] NIT Meghalaya, ME Dept, Shillong 793003, Meghalaya, India",SPRINGER,English,2228-6187,
WoS,Cardiac function and blood flow hemodynamics assessment of zebrafish (Danio rerio) using high-speed video microscopy,"Background: In the last few decades, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were introduced as a model organism to investigate human diseases including cardiovascular and neuronal disorders. In most zebrafish investigations, cardiac function and blood flow hemodynamics need to be assessed to study the effects of the interference on the cardiovascular system. For heart function assessment, most important parameters include heart rate, cardiac output, ejection fraction, fractional area change, and fractional shortening. Methods: A 10 s high-speed video of beating heart and flowing blood within major vessels of zebrafish that are less than 5 days post fertilization (dpf) were recorded via a stereo microscope equipped with a high speed camera. The videos were analyzed using MicroZebraLab and image J software for the assessment of cardiac function. Results: Using the technique described here, we were able to simply yet effectively assess cardiac function and blood flow dynamics of normal zebrafish embryos.

WoS,ASPLe: A methodology to develop self-adaptive software systems with systematic reuse,"More than two decades of research have demonstrated an increasing need for software systems to be self-adaptive. Self-adaptation manages runtime dynamics, which are difficult to predict before deployment. A vast body of knowledge to develop Self-Adaptive Software Systems (SASS) has been established. However, we discovered a lack of process support to develop self-adaptive systems with reuse. The lack of process support may hinder knowledge transfer and quality design. To that end, we propose a domain-engineering based methodology, Autonomic Software Product Lines engineering (ASPLe), which provides step-by-step guidelines for developing families of SASS with systematic reuse. The evaluation results from a case study show positive effects on quality and reuse for self-adaptive systems designed using the ASPLe compared to state-of-the-art engineering practices.

WoS,Achieving agility and quality in product development - an empirical study of hardware startups,"Context: Startups aim at scaling their business, often by developing innovative products with limited human and financial resources. The development of software products in the startup context is known as opportunistic, agility-driven, and with high tolerance for technical debt. The special context of hardware startups calls for a better understanding of state-of-the-practice of hardware startups' activities. Objective: This study aimed to identify whether and how startups can achieve product quality while maintaining focus on agility. Method: We conducted an exploratory study with 13 hardware startups, collecting data through semi-structured interviews and analysis of documentation. We proposed an integrative model of agility and quality in hardware startups. Results: Agility in hardware startups is complex and not achieved through adoption of fast-paced development practices alone. Hardware startups follow a qualitydriven approach for development of core components, where frequent user testing is a measure for early debt management. Hardware startups often lack mindset and strategies for achieving long-term quality in early stages. Conclusions: Hardware startups need attention to hardware quality to allow for evolutionary prototyping and speed. Future research should focus on defining quality-driven practices that contribute to agility, and strategies and mindsets to support long-term quality in the hardware startup context.

WoS,The influence of Technical Debt on software developer morale,"Context: Previous research in the Technical Debt (TD) field has mainly focused on the technical and economic aspects, while its human aspect has received minimal attention. Objective: This paper aims to understand how software developers' morale is influenced by TD and how their morale is influenced by TD management activities. Furthermore, this study correlates the morale with the amount of wastage of time due to TD. Method: Firstly, we conducted 15 interviews with professionals, and, secondly, these data were complemented with a survey. Thirdly, we collected 473 data points from 43 developers reporting their amount of wasted time. The collected data were analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques, including thematic and statistical analysis. Results: Our results show that the occurrence of TD is associated with a lack of progress and waste of time. This might have a negative influence on developers' morale. Further, management of TD seems to have a positive influence on developers' morale. Conclusions: The results highlight the effects TD has on practitioners' software work. This study presents results indicating that software suffering from TD reduces developers' morale and thereby also their productivity. However, our results also indicate that TD management increases developers' morale and developer productivity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The accumulation of changes pushed by different developers leave traces on the underlying code, that have an effect on its future maintainability, and even reuse. Objective: This study focuses on the how the changes by different developers might have an impact on the code: we investigate whether the work of multiple developers, and their experience, have a visible effect on the structural metrics of the underlying code. Method: We consider nine object-oriented (OO) attributes and we measure them in a GitHub sample containing the top 200 'forked' projects. For each of their classes, we evaluated the number of distinct developers contributing to its source code, and their experience in the project. Results: We show that the presence of multiple developers working on the same class has a visible effect on the chosen OO metrics, and often in the opposite direction to what the guidelines for each attribute suggest. We also show how the relative experience of developers in a project plays an important role in the distribution of those metrics, and the future maintenance of the Java classes. Conclusions: Our results show how distributed development has an effect on the structural attributes of a software system and how the experience of developers plays a fundamental role in that effect.

WoS,An automatic software vulnerability classification framework using term frequency-inverse gravity moment and feature selection,"Vulnerability classification is an important activity in software development and software quality maintenance. A typical vulnerability classification model usually involves a stage of term selection, in which the relevant terms are identified via feature selection. It also involves a stage of term-weighting, in which the document weights for the selected terms are computed, and a stage for classifier learning. Generally, the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) model is the most widely used term-weighting metric for vulnerability classification. However, several issues hinder the effectiveness of the TF-IDF model for document classification. To address this problem, we propose and evaluate a general framework for vulnerability severity classification using the term frequency-inverse gravity moment (TF-IGM). Specifically, we extensively compare the term frequency-inverse gravity moment, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and information gain feature selection using five machine learning algorithms on ten vulnerable software applications containing a total number of 27,248 security vulnerabilities. The experimental result shows that: (i) the TF-IGM model is a promising term weighting metric for vulnerability classification compared to the classical term-weighting metric, (ii) the effectiveness of feature selection on vulnerability classification varies significantly across the studied datasets and (iii) feature selection improves vulnerability classification.

WoS,Integrating GitLab metrics into coursework consultation sessions in a software engineering course,"Software developers use version control systems for collaborative coding. These systems are integrated into several software development platforms (including GitLab and GitHub) which support additional software engineering functionalities. Using these platforms in an educational context allows students to gain skills relevant to industry, whilst providing a means of keeping track of their activities. In this paper, we investigate the effect of presenting teams of students with GitLab metrics about their performance at coursework consultation sessions (checkpoint sessions), with a particular focus on the number of issues assigned and completed, and the number of commits made to the repository. A comparative analysis of project marks in two consecutive academic years indicates that these checkpoint sessions may lead to better student outcomes. An interview study with students and teaching assistants identified viewing the GitLab metrics in the checkpoints as an opportunity to see the relative contributions of team members and address resulting issues, and as a catalyst for improving engagement with the team project. The study also identified drawbacks of using the metrics too simplistically, and suggested that it was important to consider the quality and amount of written code, as well as the number of times someone committed to the repository.

WoS,CODE reuse in practice: Benefiting or harming technical debt,"During the last years the TD community is striving to offer methods and tools for reducing the amount of TD, but also understand the underlying concepts. One popular practice that still has not been investigated in the context of TD, is software reuse. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relation between white-box code reuse and TD principal and interest. In particular, we target at unveiling if the reuse of code can lead to software with better levels of TD. To achieve this goal, we performed a case study on approximately 400 OSS systems, comprised of 897 thousand classes, and compare the levels of TD for reused and natively-written classes. The results of the study suggest that reused code usually has less TD interest; however, the amount of principal in them is higher. A synthesized view of the aforementioned results suggest that software engineers shall opt to reuse code when necessary, since apart from the established reuse benefits (i.e., cost savings, increased productivity, etc.) are also getting benefits in terms of maintenance. Apart from understanding the phenomenon per se, the results of this study provide various implications to research and practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,Code smells and refactoring: A tertiary systematic review of challenges and observations,"Refactoring and smells have been well researched by the software-engineering research community these past decades. Several secondary studies have been published on code smells, discussing their implications on software quality, their impact on maintenance and evolution, and existing tools for their detection. Other secondary studies addressed refactoring, discussing refactoring techniques, opportunities for refactoring, impact on quality, and tools support. In this paper, we present a tertiary systematic literature review of previous surveys, secondary systematic literature reviews, and systematic mappings. We identify the main observations (what we know) and challenges (what we do not know) on code smells and refactoring. We perform this tertiary review using eight scientific databases, based on a set of five research questions, identifying 40 secondary studies between 1992 and 2018. We organize the main observations and challenges about code smell and their refactoring into: smells definitions, most common code-smell detection approaches, code-smell detection tools, most common refactoring, and refactoring tools. We show that code smells and refactoring have a strong relationship with quality attributes, i.e., with understandability, maintainability, testability, complexity, functionality, and reusability. We argue that code smells and refactoring could be considered as the two faces of a same coin. Besides, we identify how refactoring affects quality attributes, more than code smells. We also discuss the implications of this work for practitioners, researchers, and instructors. We identify 13 open issues that could guide future research work.

WoS,Transformed k-nearest neighborhood output distance minimization for predicting the defect density of software projects,"Background: Software defect prediction is one of the most important research topics in software engineering. An important product measure to determine the effectiveness of software processes is the defect density (DD). Cased-based reasoning (CBR) has been the prediction technique most widely applied in the software prediction field. The CBR involves k-nearest neighborhood for finding the number (k) of similar software projects selected to be involved in the prediction process. Objective: To propose the application of a transformed k-nearest neighborhood output distance minimization (TkDM) algorithm to predict the DD of software projects to compare its prediction accuracy with those obtained from statistical regression, support vector regression, and neural networks. Method: Data sets were obtained from the ISBSG release 2018. A leave-one-out cross validation method was performed. Absolute residual was used as the prediction accuracy criterion for models. Results: Statistical significance tests among models showed that the TkDM had the best prediction accuracy than those ones from statistical regression, support vector regression, and neural networks. Conclusions: A TkDM can be used for predicting the DD of new and enhanced software projects developed and coded in specific platforms and programming languages types. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,When to update systematic literature reviews in software engineering,"[Context] Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been adopted by the Software Engineering (SE) community for approximately 15 years to provide meaningful summaries of evidence on several topics. Many of these SLRs are now potentially outdated, and there are no systematic proposals on when to update SLRs in SE. [Objective] The goal of this paper is to provide recommendations on when to update SLRs in SE. [Method] We evaluated, using a three-step approach, a third-party decision framework (3PDF) employed in other fields, to decide whether SLRs need updating. First, we conducted a literature review of SLR updates in SE and contacted the authors to obtain their feedback relating to the usefulness of the 3PDF within the context of SLR updates in SE. Second, we used these authors' feedback to see whether the framework needed any adaptation; none was suggested. Third, we applied the 3PDF to the SLR updates identified in our literature review. [Results] The 3PDF showed that 14 of the 20 SLRs did not need updating. This supports the use of a decision support mechanism (such as the 3PDF) to help the SE community decide when to update SLRs. [Conclusions] We put forward that the 3PDF should be adopted by the SE community to keep relevant evidence up to date and to avoid wasting effort with unnecessary updates. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,Model-based testing of software product lines: Mapping study and research roadmap,"Model-Based Testing (MBT) has been successfully applied to Software Product Lines (SPL). This paper provides a panorama of state-of-the-art on MBT of SPLs. We performed a systematic mapping for answering questions related with domains, approaches, solution types, variability, test case automation, artifacts, and evaluation. We built a roadmap from 44 selected studies. Main obtained results are: Software and Automotive domains are most considered; Black-box testing is widely performed; most studies have fully-automated support; variability is considered in most studies; Finite State Machines is the most used model to test SPLs; Behavioral-based and Scenario-based are the most used models; Case Studies and Experiments are used to evaluate MBT solutions and the majority is performed in industrial environments; traceability is not widely explored for MBT solutions. Furthermore, we provide a roadmap synthesizing studies based on used models, more formal artifacts, supporting tools, variability management, (semi-)automation, and traceability. The roadmap contributes to identify related primary studies based on given artifacts, variability management, tools, automation, and traceability techniques and to identify, from a given primary study, which artifacts, tools, variability management, automation and traceability techniques are related. Therefore, the roadmap serves as a guide to researchers and practitioners on how to model-based test SPLs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,Transient cavitating flow structure and acoustic analysis of a hydrofoil with whalelike wavy leading edge,"In this paper, the open source software OpenFOAM is used to perform a numerical investigation of the cavitating flow around a modified NACA63(4)-021 hydrofoil with bioinspired, wavy leading edge, with particular emphasis on study of the interactions between the cavitation and the streamwise vortices and the far-field radiation noise. A modified k-omega shearstress transport (SST) model coupled with the Schnerr-Sauer cavitation model and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy approach are introduced to the simulation. The transient cavitation structure and the streamwise vortices are captured well and the results show significant interactions between the cavitation and the streamwise vortices. Cavitation can promote fragmentation of the streamwise vortices, while the streamwise vortices cause cavitation inception to occur earlier and bind the cavitation within the trough region by changing the pressure distribution on the hydrofoil. The transformation of the FW-H equation's solution indicates that the monopole noise is directly related to the cavitation volume acceleration and the dipole noise is related to the mechanical force of the hydrofoil on fluids and the rate at which this force changes. The collapse of cavitation cloud and the collision of the re-entrant jet and main flow will cause violent fluctuation of the mechanical force thus produce instantaneous extreme dipole noise values, while the monopole noise is relatively strong in the cavitation collapse stage due to significant cavitation volume acceleration. The time domain hydroacoustic characteristics are similar for the modified hydrofoil and the baseline hydrofoil. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,Analytical solution considering the tangential effect for an infinite beam on a viscoelastic Pasternak foundation,"In this study, the dynamic response of an infinite beam resting on a Pasternak foundation subjected to inclined travelling loads was developed in the form of the analytical solution wherein the tangential effect between the beam and foundation and the damping were taken into consideration. Three parameters were used to model the mechanical resistance of the viscoelastic Pasternak foundation, one of them accounts for the compressive stress in the soil, the other accounts for the shearing effect of soils, and the last one accounts for the damping of the foundation. By contrast, the Pasternak model is more realistic than the Winkler model that just considers the compressive resistance of soil. In the paper, the tangential effect between the beam and foundation was simulated by a series of separate horizontal springs, the damping was also considered to obtain the dynamic response under forced vibration. The theory of elasticity and Newton's laws were used to derive the governing equation. To simplify the partial-differential equation to an algebraic equation, the double Fourier transformation was used wherein the analytical solution in the frequency domain for the dynamic response of the beam is obtained. And its inversion was adopted to convert the integral representation of the solution into the time domain. The degraded solution was then utilized to verify the validity of the proposed solution. Finally, the Maple mathematical software was used for further discussion. The solution proposed in this study can be a useful tool for practitioners.

WoS,HBIM for storing life-cycle data regarding decay and damage in existing timber structures,"The conservation and maintenance of the historical heritage is an issue of great importance, especially when dealing with elements that can easily suffer damage along the time, either to intrinsic materials properties or by exposure conditions, like often happen for timber structures. For the management and maintenance of historic timber structures, HBIM (Historic Building Information Modeling) is here presented as a fundamental tool. This work presents the application of a methodology that uses common HBIM software in combination with results obtained from non-destructive testing and geometric surveying, allowing it to perform modeling, analysis and storage of geometric data, levels of decay and lack of material of timber structures within a tridimensional space. Moreover, the proposed framework incorporates different time stages, thus allowing to make periodic comparisons along time, that substantiate a decision making process to take decisions about maintenance and intervention actions. In this work two case studies are used to validate this methodology and present its possible use. The case studies are: (i) the timber structure of the roof of the key tower of the Castle of Guimaraes, and (ii) the timber structure of the ceiling and roof of the room of the Knight's Room in the Convent of Christ, Tomar, both Portuguese buildings listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.",Wood; Non-destructive test data; LiDAR; Cloud points; BIM environment,"Mol, A; Cabaleiro, M; Sousa, HS; Branco, JM",2020.0,Journal,AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION,10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103262,"[Cabaleiro, Manuel] Univ Vigo, Sch Ind Engn, Dept Mat Engn Appl Mech & Construct, Vigo 36208, Spain; [Mol, Alvaro; Sousa, Helder S.; Branco, Jorge M.] Univ Minho, Inst Sci & Innovat BioSustainabil IB S, Dept Civil Engn, ISISE, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal",ELSEVIER,English,0926-5805,
WoS,An optimized multicopter UAV sounding technique (MUST) for probing comprehensive atmospheric variables,"The unique maneuverability, ease of deployment, simplicity in logistics, and relatively low costs of multicopters render them effective vehicles for low atmospheric research. While many efforts have contributed to the fundamental success of atmospheric applications of multicopters in the past, several challenges remain, including limited measurable variables, possible response-delay in real-time observations, insufficient measurement accuracy, endurance of harsh conditions and tolerance towards interferences. To address these challenges and further fortify the applicability in diversified research disciplines, this study developed an optimized multicopter UAV sounding technique (MUST). The MUST serves as an integrated platform by combining self-developed algorithms, optimized working environments for sensors/monitors, and retrofitted sampling devices to probe a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables. These variables of interest include meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind direction and speed), the chemical composition (speciated VOCs, CO, CO2, CH4, CO2 isotopologues, O-3, PM2.5, and black carbon), and the radiation flux, as well as visible and thermal images. The aim of this study is to achieve the following objectives: 1. to easily probe a comprehensive set of near-surface atmospheric variables; 2. to improve data quality by correcting for sensors' delay in real-time observations and minimizing environmental interferences; and 3. to enhance the versatility and applicability of aerial measurements by incorporating necessary hardware and software. Field launching cases from the surface to a maximum height of 1000 m were conducted to validate the robustness of the integrated MUST platform with sufficient speed, accuracy and resolution for the target variables.

WoS,Machine learning for predictive scheduling and resource allocation in large scale manufacturing systems,"The digitalization processes in manufacturing enterprises and the integration of increasingly smart shop floor devices and software control systems caused an explosion in the data points available in Manufacturing Execution Systems. The degree in which enterprises can capture value from big data processing and extract useful insights represents a differentiating factor in developing controls that optimize production and protect resources. Machine learning and Big Data technologies have gained increased traction being adopted in some critical areas of planning and control. Cloud manufacturing allows using these technologies in real time, lowering the cost of implementing and deployment. In this context, the paper offers a machine learning approach for reality awareness and optimization in cloud. Specifically, the paper focuses on predictive production planning (operation scheduling, resource allocation) and predictive maintenance. The main contribution of this research consists in developing a hybrid control solution that uses Big Data techniques and machine learning algorithms to process in real time information streams in large scale manufacturing systems, focusing on energy consumptions that are aggregated at various layers. The control architecture is distributed at the edge of the shop floor for data collecting and format transformation, and then centralized at the cloud computing platform for data aggregation, machine learning and intelligent decisions. The information is aggregated in logical streams and consolidated based on relevant metadata; a neural network is trained and used to determine possible anomalies or variations relative to the normal patterns of energy consumption at each layer. This novel approach allows for accurate forecasting of energy consumption patterns during production by using Long Short-term Memory neural networks and deep learning in real time to re-assign resources (for batch cost optimization) and detect anomalies (for robustness) based on predicted enerdgy data.

In vitro models can be used to compare these responses between adjuvants and the infection targeted by the vaccine. We utilized transcriptomic profiling of an Atlantic salmon cell line to compare innate immune responses against ISAV and an experimental viral vaccine adjuvant: poly (I:C). Induction of interferon and interferon induced genes were observed after both treatments, but often with different amplitude and kinetics. Using KEGG ortholog database and available software from Bioconductor we could specify a complete bioinformatic pipeline for analysis of transcriptomic data from Atlantic salmon, a feature not previously available.

WoS,Fingerprinting pike: The use of image recognition to identify individual pikes,"It is difficult to determine the individual behaviour, growth, and survival of large predatory freshwater fish without stressing or even killing them. In this study, we tested the ability of an image recognition program to identify individual recaptured pike (Esox lucius) based on skin pattern. We and local anglers caught 209 pike individuals, including 45 recaptures, over the course of 1.5 years. The software correctly identified the image of all recaptured fish as already present in the database. Based on recaptures, we predicted a population of 560 pike in the lake and showed a much more comprehensive size structure than seen using standardized gillnet sampling which only yielded four pike. Angling and photographic identification involving reporting by citizen-scientists provided valuable temporal data in a non-invasive manner compared to traditional sampling. This methodology is based on freeware software and removes the need for any tagging equipment. It can potentially be used on other freshwater fish species and larger populations if the skin pattern is distinctive. However, it relies on the willingness of anglers to report their catches.",Capture-recapture; Citizen-science; Photo-identification; Population structure; Temporal data,"Kristensen, E; Sand-Jensen, K; Martinsen, KT; Madsen-Osterbye, M; Kragh, T",2020.0,Journal,FISHERIES RESEARCH,10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105622,"[Kristensen, Emil; Sand-Jensen, Kaj; Martinsen, Kenneth Thoro; Madsen-Osterbye, Mikkel; Kragh, Theis] Univ Copenhagen, Biol Inst, Freshwater Biol Sect, Univ Pk 4,3rd Floor, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",ELSEVIER,English,0165-7836,
WoS,IoTSim-SDWAN: A simulation framework for interconnecting distributed datacenters over Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN),"Software-defined networking (SDN) has evolved as an approach that allows network administrators to program and initialize, control, change and manage networking components (mostly at L2-L3 layers) of the OSI model. SDN is designed to address the programmability shortcomings of traditional networking architectures commonly used in cloud datacenters (CDC). Deployment of SDN solutions have demonstrated significant improvements in areas such as flow optimization and bandwidth allocation in a CDC. However, the benefits are significantly less explored when considering Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) architectures in the context of delivering solutions by networking multiple CDCs. To support the testing and bench-marking of data-driven applications that rely on data ingestion and processing (e.g., Smart Energy Cloud, Content Delivery Networks) across multiple cloud datacenters, this paper presents the simulator, IoTSim-SDWAN. To the best of our knowledge, IoTSim-SDWAN is the first simulator that facilitates the modeling, simulating, and evaluating of new algorithms, policies, and designs in the context of SD-WAN ecosystems and SDN-enabled multiple cloud datacenters. Finally, IoTSim-SDWAN simulator is evaluated for network performance and energy to illustrate the difference between classical WAN and SD-WAN environments. The obtained results show that SD-WAN surpasses the classical WAN in terms of accelerating traffic flows and reducing power consumption. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

WoS,Cost optimization of secure routing with untrusted devices in software defined networking,"Over the years, switches and network routers have been compromised frequently, and a lot of vulnerabilities have occurred in network infrastructure. Secure routing (SR) is one of the challenges that currently exists in computer networks. Software-defined networks (SDN) are designed by assuming that routers or switches are trustworthy. In SDN, untrusted devices have resulted in security issues such as traffic analysis, failure to receive information, packet change and removal, inaccurate routing, and network downtime. Using encryption methods is a possible solution to deal with some of these problems, but it requires additional infrastructure as well as significant overhead at runtime. One of the most trusted routing methods is through replicated devices (switches or routers). Recently we have seen less attention given to the number of replicated devices in SR. In this paper, the problem of SR is converted into a multi-objective optimization problem, considering the reliability of different manufacturers and SR with untrusted devices is performed. To this end, a mathematical model is provided to study the objectives of maximum reliability and cost minimization. The NSGA-II algorithm is applied to determine the optimal number of replicated devices in order to minimize the cost of implementing SR in spite of the presence of untrusted devices in SDN. Our simulation results show that our proposed method compared to the base method (without considering optimization) decreases implementation cost by 27% and increases the reliability from 70% to 93.2%.

WoS,Advantages of first-derivative reflectance spectroscopy in the VNIR-SWIR for the quantification of olivine and hematite,"The focus of this paper is to study the application of the first order derivative method for the estimation of minerals rates in different mineral mixtures. The primary goal with this is to find robust spectral features of specific minerals that are not severely influenced by the spectral features of the other minerals in a mixture. Results were used to select appropriate spectral features to be applied for quantifying the minerals in upcoming studies. Mixtures of different terrestrial minerals equivalent to those dominating the Martian surface with a grain size <0.25 mm were prepared and analyzed in the laboratory by reflectance spectroscopy in the VNIR-SWIR range. The first derivatives were computed and correlated with the mineral concentration at specific wavelengths using the Unscrambler X software. The results indicated the first derivatives near 2300 nm, that is a characteristic absorption feature of olivine rich in magnesium and iron silicate, correlate strongly to the olivine content for all the mixtures containing olivine, binary and ternary, with regression coefficients ranging between 0.93 and 0.98. Additionally, the main advantage of this work is that first derivative spectra of mixtures with different olivine ratio highlights in the overlapping regions of the spectra the wavelengths where the first derivative values correlate strongly to the amount of olivine in the mixtures. The region near 1050-1300 nm was identified as a promising one for hematite-olivine mixtures and 785-900 nm for magnetite olivine, with a regression coefficient mean of 0.97 and 0.98, respectively. The study of hematite-plagioclase mixtures demonstrates that wavelengths near 785-858 nm and 940-989 nm lying within the overlapping regions of hematite and plagioclase exhibit robust correlation to the hematite content with a regression coefficient mean of 0.98 for both areas.",Reflectance spectroscopy; First derivative; Quantification; Minerals; Olivine,"Bou-Orm, N; AlRomaithi, AA; Elrmeithi, M; Ali, FM; Nazzal, Y; Howari, FM; Al Aydaroos, F",2020.0,Journal,PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE,10.1016/j.pss.2020.104957,"[Bou-Orm, Nadine; AlRomaithi, Amna Abdulrahman; Elrmeithi, Mariam; Ali, Fatima Mohammad; Nazzal, Yousef; Howari, Fares M.] Zayed Univ, Coll Nat & Hlth Sci, POB 144534, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Al Aydaroos, Fatima] UAE Space Agcy, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0032-0633,
WoS,Solidification and heat treatment simulation for aluminum alloys with scandium addition through CALPHAD approach,"Scandium, and scandium combined with zirconium, improves multiple properties of aluminum based alloys. In this work, we performed solidification and heat treatment simulations for studying precipitation kinetics of Al3Sc crystals within the framework of CALPHAD approach on novel candidate alloy compositions from our previous work belonging to 2XXX, 6XXX and 7XXX class of aluminum alloys. In our previous work, computational study was performed on stability of various stable and metastable phases along with thermodynamically stable Al3Sc phase in heat-treatable aluminum alloys of 2XXX, 6XXX and 7XXX series by application of several concepts of artificial intelligence on phase stability data generated under the framework of CALPHAD approach. We considered 12 elements for 2XXX, 10 elements for 6XXX and 11 elements for 7XXX class of alloys, thus selected a comparatively large multicomponent system when compared to works reported on aluminum alloys through CALPHAD approach. In 2XXX and 7XXX series, both Sc and Zr were included, while in 6XXX series only Sc was added. Software Thermocalc was used to generate phase stability data. For proper precipitation of Al3Sc crystals during heat treatment, it is important that Al3Sc is present in the melt. Hence, solidification simulation (Scheil-Gulliver) was performed, followed by heat treatment simulation at various temperatures for a few candidate alloys belonging to these three series of aluminum alloys with Sc added.

This study describes a unique three-dimensional reconstruction of a lignite microstructure using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to acquire images of subsequent coal cross-sections which are exposed by focused ion beam (FIB) milling at cryogenic temperatures. Because of the organic origin and high moisture content, the fully hydrated lignite sample was frozen in nitrogen slush for the SEM observation in its frozen native state in order to avoid dehydration and other sample modifications. The acquired data cube contained distinguished petrographic phases, identified with coaly macerals of xylitic and detritic coal along with the fragment of the gelified leaf tissue, typical for ortho-lignite structure. The 3D reconstruction and phase segmentation process was performed using the Avizo software to constitute a cuboid model with an edge length of ca. 10 mu m. Lignite exhibits low local uniformity, therefore to draw generally valid conclusions, a statistical relevant number of similar three dimensional reconstructions at representative locations for the different lithotypical and petrographic coal compositions within the analysed fragment would be demanded.",Low-rank coal; Lignite; Brown coal; Xylitic coal; Detritic coal; Focused ion beam; 3D coal microstructure reconstruction; cryo-FIB-SEM tomography,"Zakrzewski, M; Schertel, A; Brus, G; Wagner, M; Sciazko, A; Komatsu, Y; Kimijima, S; Kaneko, S; Szmyd, JS",2020.0,Journal,FUEL,10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117919,"[Zakrzewski, Marcin; Brus, Grzegorz; Sciazko, Anna; Szmyd, Janusz S.] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Fundamental Res Energy Engn, 30 Mickiewicza Ave, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Schertel, Andreas] Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, ZEISS Customer Ctr Europe, D-73447 Oberkochen, Germany; [Wagner, Marian] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Min Geol, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland; [Sciazko, Anna; Komatsu, Yosuke; Kaneko, Shozo] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Kimijima, Shinji] Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Machinery & Control Syst, Saitama 3378570, Japan",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0016-2361,
WoS,Programmable Photonics: An Opportunity for an Accessible Large-Volume PIC Ecosystem,"We look at the opportunities presented by the new concepts of generic programmable photonic integrated circuits (PIC) to deploy photonics on a larger scale. Programmable PICs consist of waveguide meshes of tunable couplers and phase shifters that can be reconfigured in software to define diverse functions and arbitrary connectivity between the input and output ports. Off-the-shelf programmable PICs can dramatically shorten the development time and deployment costs of new photonic products, as they bypass the design-fabrication cycle of a custom PIC. These chips, which actually consist of an entire technology stack of photonics, electronics packaging and software, can potentially be manufactured cheaper and in larger volumes than application-specific PICs. We look into the technology requirements of these generic programmable PICs and discuss the economy of scale. Finally, we make a qualitative analysis of the possible application spaces where generic programmable PICs can play an enabling role, especially to companies who do not have an in-depth background in PIC technology.",Photonics; Integrated optics; Optical waveguides; Adaptive optics; Couplers; Phase shifters; Silicon; Integrated optics; costs; techno-economic analysis; programmable circuits,"Bogaerts, W; Rahim, A",2020.0,Journal,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS,10.1109/JSTQE.2020.2982980,"[Bogaerts, Wim; Rahim, Abdul] Univ Ghent, IMEC, Photon Res Grp, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,1077-260X,
WoS,Quantifying surgeon maneuevers across experience levels through marker-less hand motion kinematics of simulated surgical tasks,"This paper compares clinician hand motion for common suturing tasks across a range of experience levels and tissue types. Medical students (32), residents (41), attending surgeons (10), and retirees (2) were recorded on digital video while suturing on one of: foam, pig feet, or porcine bowel. Depending on time in position, each medical student, resident, and attending participant was classified as junior or senior, yielding six experience categories. This work focuses on trends associated with increasing tenure observed from those medical students (10), residents (15), and attendings (10) who sutured on foam, and draws comparison across tissue types where pertinent. Utilizing custom software, the two-dimensional location of each of the participant's hands were automatically recorded in every video frame, producing a rich spatiotemporal feature set. While suturing on foam, increasing clinician experience was associated with conserved path length per cycle of the non-dominant hand, significantly reducing from junior medical students (mean = 73.63 cm, sd = 33.21 cm) to senior residents (mean = 46.16 cm, sd = 14.03 cm, p = 0.015), and again between senior residents and senior attendings (mean = 30.84 cm, sd = 14.51 cm, p = 0.045). Despite similar maneuver rates, attendings also accelerated less with their non-dominant hand (mean = 16.27 cm/s(2), sd = 81.12 cm/s(2), p = 0.002) than senior residents (mean = 24.84 cm/s(2), sd = 68.29 cm/s(2), p = 0.002). While tying, medical students moved their dominant hands slower (mean = 4.39 cm/s, sd = 1.73 cm/s, p = 0.033) than senior residents (mean = 6.53 cm/s, sd = 2.52 cm/s). These results suggest that increased psychomotor performance during early training manifest through faster dominant hand function, while later increases are characterized by conserving energy and efficiently distributing work between hands. Incorporating this scalable video-based motion analysis into regular formative assessment routines may enable greater quality and consistency of feedback throughout a surgical career.",Marker-less; Assessment; Surgery,"Azari, DP; Miller, BL; Le, BV; Greenberg, CC; Radwin, RG",2020.0,Journal,APPLIED ERGONOMICS,10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103136,"[Azari, David P.; Radwin, Robert G.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 1550 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Miller, Brady L.; Le, Brian, V] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Urol, Third Floor,1685 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Greenberg, Caprice C.] Univ Wisconsin, Clin Sci Ctr, Dept Surg, Wisconsin Surg Outcomes Res WiSOR Program, 600 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53792 USA; [Radwin, Robert G.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biomed Engn, 1415 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0003-6870,
WoS,Difference thresholds for a vehicle on a 4-poster test rig,"Improving vibration-induced discomfort often requires a reduction in the vibration experienced by vehicle occupants. Simulation software and test equipment are able to measure changes in vibration that are too small for humans to perceive. It is therefore important to know how large the change in vibration should be, i.e. the difference threshold, for occupants to perceive an improvement in comfort. This study estimates difference thresholds for ten automotive engineers seated in a vehicle on a 4-poster test rig. Participants were exposed to multi-axis vibration. Component ride values were calculated by applying BS 6841 frequency weightings and multiplication factors to seat accelerations in the six directions. Difference thresholds were estimated for two road profiles using the vertical component ride value and combined point ride value (i.e. the root-sums-of-squares of the six component ride values). The two road profiles had different magnitudes, but the same spectral shape, resulting in median vertical component ride values of 0.58 and 1.01 m.s.(-2), root-mean-square. An updown transformed response rule was used with a three-down-one-up response grouping to estimate difference thresholds at a 79.4% probability level. The median relative difference threshold for the two roads was 10.13% and 8.58% considering the vertical component ride value, and 10.99% and 9.24% considering the combined point ride value. No statistically significant difference was found between the medians of the relative difference threshold over the two roads considering either of the two ride values (p-value = 0.995 in both instances), suggesting that Weber's law holds.",Difference threshold; Whole-body vibration; Multi-axis vibration; Vibration-induced discomfort; Ride comfort,"Grabe, RP; Kat, CJ; van Staden, PJ; Els, PS",2020.0,Journal,APPLIED ERGONOMICS,10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103115,"[Grabe, Roland Peter; Kat, Cor-Jacques; Els, Pieter Schalk] Univ Pretoria, Dept Mech & Aeronaut Engn, Hatfield, South Africa; [van Staden, Paul Jacobus] Univ Pretoria, Dept Stat, Hatfield, South Africa",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0003-6870,
WoS,Simultaneous eco-toxicity assessment technique using an online monitoring system: effects of different environmental factors on swimming behavior of zebrafish (Danio rerio),"Environmental factors, such as photoperiod and temperature were the main limiting factors for the survival of organisms in the nature environment. Changes in environmental factors are well predicted but determining their effects on organisms are challenging hot topic in the field of eco-toxicology. Thus, technology based eco-toxicity assessment was focused worldwide. In this research, the effects of different temperatures (15 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) and photoperiods (dark and light periods) on the continuous behavior responses of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were investigated using an online monitoring system (OMS). We designed a new fish chamber with sensors to measure the behavior responses of zebrafish under different conditions. Data obtained from the OMS could be assessed for factors such as difference in swimming behavior, circadian rhythm, and avoidance behavior using latest software (MATLAB). The observed behavior anomalies on zebrafish under different temperatures and continuous photoperiods were statically significant (p < 0.05). We conclude that the new designed fish chamber (behavior sensors) is good in sensing behavioral responses of zebrafish under different conditions. The fish behavior strength could be a potential biomarker to assess the effects of environmental factors. The present study would be a basic platform for assessing the effects of different stressors simultaneously on swimming behavior of zebrafish. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Uncertainty & sensitivity analyses for LOCA simulation of PHEBUS experiment FPT-1 using a modified SUNSET code,"One task of the regulatory body during the review and assessment process is the quantification of uncertainty and sensitivity (U&S) during normal and accident conditions. Nowadays there are many codes having the capability of estimating U&S, but few of them can estimate uncertainty and sensitivity during severe accident conditions. The IRSN uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis tool named SUNSET is considered one of the most important tools used in U&S analysis, where it is coupled with ASTEC software package (Accident Source Term Evaluation Code) for computing U&S during severe accident condition. Unfortunately, the SUNSET tool cannot perform U&S analyses during all the transient time. The SUNSET software can only calculate U&S parameters for maximum, minimum, and last output values, therefore it was necessary to modify the SUNSET tool to calculate U&S during the whole transient time. The main objective of this study is to develop a Python script to replace the SUNSET post-processing step, extract the results, and perform U&S analysis. ASTEC code has been used for the simulation of a loss of coolant accident in the cold leg of the primary circuit of the FPT-1 test. The obtained results indicate the efficiency of the modified SUNSET tools to calculate the uncertainty during severe accidents. In general, it was found that the code is capable to model the main severe accident phenomena. SUNSET package shows good agreement with the experimental data, for the whole calculation period, until thermocouples failure moment. The obtained results show that the main safety parameters are very sensitive to the power multiplier. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Code development and analysis of heat pipe cooled passive residual heat removal system of Molten salt reactor,"The high efficient and reliable Passive Residual Heat Removal System (PRHRS) is of great importance to the development of Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), whether the liquid fuel MSR or solid fuel MSR. In this research, based on the structure and operation performance of the new conceptual PRHRS, using high temperature heat pipe as heat transportation, a set of reasonable mathematical and physical models have been built, mainly including reactor core model, high temperature heat pipe model and PRHRS model. The new conceptual Passive Residual heat removal system Analysis Code (PRAC) has been developed using FORTRAN language. The verification and validation for PRAC is conducted by using existed Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) data provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the PRHRS experimental data in our previous work. The results show that the developed PRAC could predict the MSR transients reasonably and show high fidelity. The numerical results of reactor core neutronic and thermal-hydraulic model show a good agreement when compared with MSRE pump startup and shutdown transients. The numerical results by PRHRS model agree well with experimental data which the maximum error of the fluoride salt temperature and heat pipe wall temperature are within 1.2% and 2.8%.

WoS,Research on the software reliability quantitative evaluation of nuclear power plant digital control system based on non-homogeneous poisson process model,"With the application of digital technology, the software used in various systems has become increasingly important, as well as complex. This increase in complexity and scale has led to an increase in the probability of software failure. Quantitative reliability evaluation of the digital instrumentation and control system software used in nuclear power plants represent a significant challenge. This study uses a non-homogeneous Poisson process model for quantitative evaluation of the software reliability of a nuclear power plant safety digital control system (DCS), which is the research object. To analyse the research object, a software test environment is established, and the research object is tested to obtain the software failure data. The software reliability growth model, which is widely used in other industries, is combined with data on nuclear power plant DCS software defects that obey a non-homogeneous Poisson process, to construct a non-homogeneous Poisson process model. The formulas for software reliability indicators such as total failures, remaining failures, failure rate (failures per week), reliability, and time to next failure(s) are derived. The software failure data obtained from the test are used to determine the variables of the model based on maximum likelihood estimation; the estimates are then used to quantitatively evaluate software reliability-related indicators. Finally, the minimum correlation error method is used to analyse the error by comparing the actual and model prediction results. The model can evaluate the current reliability level of software and predict the impact of subsequent reliability test results. The findings from this study can provide data support for evaluating the reliability of nuclear power plant DCS software. Therefore, this study can be significant for further research on the reliability of nuclear power plant DCS software. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Underwater vibration analysis method for rotating propeller blades using laser Doppler vibrometer,"Vibration analysis for rotating propeller blades under water is obviously challenging. This study proposes stationary and tracking laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) based measurement techniques for vibration analysis of the rotating propeller. The vibration measurement setup consists of an LDV, a DAQ and control system, and the rotating propeller that contains five blades mounted to the shaft through a rotor. To confirm the reliability of the proposed stationary and tacking LDV measurement results, the hammer impact tests are performed using a contact PZT accelerometer to obtain the velocity vibration results in time and frequency domain. These results are compared with LDV measurements for both in air and underwater cases. Both LDV and contact PZT measurements were taken simultaneously. The compared results show that the time-velocity signals and the corresponding frequency components obtained using hammer impact tests are very similar to the proposed LDV based measurement techniques. In addition, a numerical simulation is performed using COMSOL Multiphysics software to obtain natural frequencies of the system in air and underwater cases. These numerical simulation results are compared with bolt impact measurements taken on rotating propeller blade using LDV. Comparison of stationary and tracking LDV measurement results with the numerical analysis for in air and underwater cases showed matching results. From these results, it is concluded that the proposed techniques can be effectively used for underwater vibration measurement of the blades of rotating propeller.",Propeller; Underwater; Vibration analysis; Laser Doppler vibrometer; Stationary and tracking measurement techniques,"Abbas, SH; Jang, JK; Kim, DH; Lee, JR",2020.0,Journal,OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.optlaseng.2020.106133,"[Abbas, Syed Haider; Jang, Jae-Kyeong; Lee, Jung-Ryul] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Aerosp Engn, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kim, Dong-Ho] Hyundai Heavy Ind, Dynam Res Dept, Adv Technol Res Inst, Ulsan, South Korea",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0143-8166,
WoS,In-situ construction of Co(OH)(2) nanoparticles decorated urchin-like WO3 for highly efficient degradation of sulfachloropyridazine via peroxymonosulfate activation: Intermediates and DFT calculation,"Sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) was commonly used as a broad-spectrum sulfonamide antibiotic and hard to be removed through traditional sewage treatment process. In this study, we developed a simple and controllable strategy to realize in-situ construction of Co(OH)(2) nanoparticles decorated urchin-like WO3 (Co(OH)(2)/WO3), which could efficiently remove SCP through peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Some tiny nanoparticles of Co (OH)(2) decorated on the spines/nanorods or surfaces of urchin-like WO3y by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The obtained 10 wt% Co(OH)(2)/WO3 realized completely removal of SCP (degradation efficiency 100%) with a high reaction rate constant (k(1)) of 0.88 min(-1) within 3 min at optimal pH 7. That was because the urchin-like WO3 with numerous adsorption functional groups on its surface (e.g., W = O and -OH bonds) could adsorb the Co2+ easily to form CoOH+, which was perceived the rate-limiting step for PMS activation and generating radicals. Radical quenching experiments indicated that SO4 center dot- played a more significant role than HO center dot radicals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the atoms of SCP with high Fukui index (f-) were active sites, which preferred to be attacked by the electrophilic SO4 center dot- and HO center dot radicals. The toxicity of the intermediates by SCP degradation was evaluated by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) prediction through Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T.). The possible degradation pathway and catalytic mechanism for SCP removal were proposed.

WoS,An exploratory spatial analysis of low birth weight and its determinants in India,"Background: Low birth weight (LBW), defined as a live birth weighing less than 2500 g, is a significant public health problem in India. The complex nature of this problem is not fully understood. Moreover, significant disparities in LBW prevalence not only documented across various socio economic groups but across states and districts as well. The identification of spatial patterns of LBW and its determinants is important for understanding epidemiology of this public health challenge. Objective: This paper examines the determinants and spatial patterns of Low birth weight prevalence spatial pattern of LBW and its determinants in India. Methods: Using fourth round of National Family Health Survey data, regression and spatial analysis have been performed through STATA, ArcGIS and GeoDa software. Results: The result indicates lower odds of LBW prevalence among educated mothers, mothers who have more than 4 ANC visit, mothers who took IFA tablets during pregnancy, mothers with normal BMI and mothers with age above 20 years. The Moran's I for LBW is 0.543. It indicates high spatial autocorrelation in LBW over the districts of India The bivariate LISA maps obtained indicate spatial distribution of LBW and independent variables systematically contrasts the districts of central and eastern India (e.g. in Uttar Pradesh) with those of the extreme south (e.g. in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, etc.). Conclusion: Our findings reveal greater attention towards maternal and child health care especially for the backward districts in the states of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Bihar and Rajasthan are needed.

The latest digital camera can be slightly modified to obtain real time pupil response under infrared videography and analyzed by image analysis. So the current study has undertaken to confirm characterization of the system by comparing with manual measurements in healthy volunteers. Methods: This study was conducted in 40 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 25 years. The system was calibrated by measuring the known length of 3 different lines for reliability. Later real time static pupil pictures were measured and compared with the manual examination of pupil determined by a ruled scale with 0.5 mm accuracy. Results: The Image J software was precalibrated with known length and estimated 5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm lines respectively. The results are 5.01 +/- 0.14 mm, 10.01 +/- 0.36 mm and 15.02 +/- 0.23 mm. There were no significant differences observed between the values analyzed by two examiners. Later the results were compared between manual examination and real time image analysis.

There is considerable attention given to the impact of individual-level factors on Anaemia, but less is known about how community characteristics affect Anaemia among children. The present study was focused at estimating the prevalence and associated risk factors at individual and community level in India among children aged 6-59 months in India. Methods: Descriptive statistics and the chi-square test were applied using fourth round of National Family Health Survey dataset. Later, to explore the association of child anemia and some potential risk factors regarding hierarchy (individual and community level) of data, a multilevel logistic regression model was conducted using STATA-SE 14 software. Results: The results indicate that some aspects of the community influence the anemia risks of children. For instance, a 1% increase in the proportion of mother education in the community decreased the likelihood of anemia by 9% among children. Northeast region was the only region at lesser risk of anemia. Higher community level ethnic and religious homogeneity is associated with decreased odds of anemia among children. Children aged 12-35 months, girl child, children having diarrhoea, mothers of age group 15-24, high parity and low exposure to mass-media were the high risk individual factors of anemia among children. Conclusions: Overall, the present study indicated the requirement to include community-level factors beyond the individual level factors by policymakers to eradicate the burden of anemia in the country and the high prevalence states.",Anemia; Individual-level effects; Community-level effects; Multilevel modelling; India,"Dutta, M; Bhise, M; Prashad, L; Chaurasia, H; Debnath, P",2020.0,Journal,CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH,10.1016/j.cegh.2020.02.015,"[Dutta, Mili; Bhise, Mahadev; Debnath, Paramita] Int Inst Populat Sci IIPS, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Prashad, Lokender] Tata Inst Social Sci TISS, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Chaurasia, Himanshu] Natl Inst Res Reprod Hlth NIRRH, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",ELSEVIER - DIVISION REED ELSEVIER INDIA PVT LTD,English,2452-0918,
WoS,Estimation of lung and bronchial cancer registry completeness via capture-recapture method using population-based cancer registry in Khuzestan province in 2011,"Introduction: Population-based cancer registry (PBCR) plays a significant role in burden of cancer estimation. Estimating the completeness of cancer registry is one of the criteria to assess the quality of data (results). Also, Capture-recapture is one of the methods used to assess completeness of cancer registry. Objective: This study was aimed to estimate the completeness of lung and bronchial cancer registry using three-source capture-recapture method in Khuzestan province. Materials and methods: This study was carried out using three-source capture-recapture method and data were obtained from three sources including medical records, death certificates and pathology labs (reports) in Khuzestan. In this study, total new cases of lung and bronchial cancer registered by the three sources in 2011, were enrolled. Among the sources, the common cases were identified and the completeness rate of lung and bronchial cancer registry was calculated by log-linear method using R software, finally. Results: Totally, 426 new cases for lung cancer had reported from the three sources in 2011. The completeness index of lung cancer registry was totally estimated 72%, as well as it was independently 40%, 25% and 37.6% for the medical records, pathology reports and death certificates sources, respectively. Conclusion: According to the results, after collection and remove repetition of the cases related to lung cancer, it should be added their number registered by the pathology (labs), medical records and death certificates sources by 28%-40%, to estimate actual incidence of lung cancer.

WoS,Quality of services provided by public funded ambulance program: Experience from a northern state in India,"Background: Ambulance Services are vital in providing pre-hospital treatment and care to help regain life. Timely and safe transport of patients from the emergency scene to the appropriate healthcare facility for further care is a complex process. Administering emergency services in minimal time is a challenge in a country with basic lacunae in infrastructure, making the role of EMTs (emergency medical technicians) and ambulance quality vital in saving lives. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire for the emergency medical technicians and ten parameters to inspect the quality of ambulances was used. Emergency medical technicians in 150 ambulances were interviewed and ambulance was inspected through convenience sampling. Chi-squared test was applied to investigate the association between quality of ambulance & emergency medical technicians' knowledge. Logistic regression was used to obtain the measure of association adjusted for confounders. SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 25, (Licensed software of IIHMR University, Jaipur) was used for analysis. Results: Majority of the ambulances 68% (n = 102) were found to have met the standards. Almost 71% (n = 107) of the EMTs were observed to have below average knowledge. Among ambulances not meeting the standards, 66.7% (n = 101) had EMT with below average knowledge. Ambulance quality was found to be independent of the knowledge of EMTs after adjusting for the effects of years of experience and age of the EMTs.

WoS,CodeGRU: Context-aware deep learning with gated recurrent unit for source code modeling,"Context: Recently deep learning based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have shown great potential in the modeling of source code. However, a major limitation of these approaches is that they take source code as simple tokens of text and ignore its contextual, syntactical and structural dependencies. Objective: In this work, we present CodeGRU, a gated recurrent unit based source code language model that is capable of capturing source code's contextual, syntactical and structural dependencies. Method: We introduce a novel approach which can capture the source code context by leveraging the source code token types. Further, we adopt a novel approach which can learn variable size context by taking into account source code's syntax, and structural information. Results: We evaluate CodeGRU with real-world data set and it shows that CodeGRU outperforms the state-of-the-art language models and help reduce the vocabulary size up to 24.93%. Unlike previous works, we tested CodeGRU with an independent test set which suggests that our methodology does not requisite the source code comes from the same domain as training data while providing suggestions. We further evaluate CodeGRU with two software engineering applications: source code suggestion, and source code completion. Conclusion: Our experiment confirms that the source code's contextual information can be vital and can help improve the software language models.

WoS,Comparing manual and automated feature location in conceptual models: A Controlled experiment,"Context: Maintenance activities cannot be completed without locating the set of software artifacts that realize a particular feature of a software system. Manual Feature Location (FL) is widely used in industry, but it becomes challenging (time-consuming and error prone) in large software repositories. To reduce manual efforts, automated FL techniques have been proposed. Research efforts in FL tend to make comparisons between automated FL techniques, ignoring manual FL techniques. Moreover, existing research puts the focus on code, neglecting other artifacts such as models. Objective: This paper aims to compare manual FL against automated FL in models to answer important questions about performance, productivity, and satisfaction of both treatments. Method: We run an experiment for comparing manual and automated FL on a set of 18 subjects (5 experts and 13 non-experts) in the domain of our industrial partner, BSH, manufacturer of induction hobs for more than 15 years. We measure performance (recall, precision, and F-measure), productivity (ratio between F-measure and spent time), and satisfaction (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use) of both treatments, and perform statistical tests to assess whether the obtained differences are significant. Results: Regarding performance, manual FL significantly outperforms automated FL in precision and F-measure (up to 27.79% and 19.05%, respectively), whereas automated FL significantly outperforms manual FL in recall (up to 32.18%). Regarding productivity, manual FL obtains 3.43%/min, which improves automated FL significantly. Finally, there are no significant differences in satisfaction for both treatments. Conclusions: The findings of our work can be leveraged to advance research to improve the results of manual and automated FL techniques. For instance, automated FL in industry faces issues such as low discrimination capacity. In addition, the obtained satisfaction results have implications for the usage and possible combination of manual, automated, and guided FL techniques.",Controlled experiment; Feature location; Model-Driven engineering; Conceptual models,"Perez, F; Echeverria, J; Lapena, R; Cetina, C",2020.0,Journal,INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.infsof.2020.106337,"[Perez, Francisca; Echeverria, Jorge; Lapena, Raul; Cetina, Carlos] Univ San Jorge, SVIT Res Grp, Autovia A-23 Zaragoza Huesca Km299, Zaragoza 50830, Spain",ELSEVIER,English,0950-5849,
WoS,On an optimal analogy-based software effort estimation,"Context: An analogy-based software effort estimation technique estimates the required effort for a new software project based on the total effort used in completing past similar projects. In practice, offering high accuracy can be difficult for the technique when the new software project is not similar to any completed projects. In this case, the accuracy will rely heavily on a process called effort adaptation, where the level of difference between the new project and its most similar past projects is quantified and transformed to the difference in the effort. In the past, attempts to adapt to the effort used machine learning algorithms; however, no algorithm was able to offer a significantly higher performance. On the contrary, only a simple heuristic such as scaling the effort by consulting the difference in software size was adopted. Objective: More recently, million-dollar prize data-science competitions have fostered the rapid development of more powerful machine learning algorithms, such as the Gradient boosting machine and Deep learning algorithm. Therefore, this study revisits the comparison of software effort adaptors that are based on heuristics and machine learning algorithms. Method: A systematic comparison of software effort estimators, which they all were fully optimized by Bayesian optimization technique, was carried out on 13 standard benchmark datasets. The comparison was supported by robust performance metrics and robust statistical test methods. Conclusion: The results suggest a novel strategy to construct a more accurate analogy-based estimator by adopting a combined effort adaptor. In particular, the analogy-based model that adapts to the effort by integrating the Gradient boosting machine algorithm and a traditional adaptation technique based on productivity adjustment has performed the best in the study. Particularly, this model significantly outperformed various state-of-the-art effort estimation techniques, including a current standard benchmark algorithmic-based technique, analogy-based techniques, and machine learning-based techniques.",Software effort estimation; Analogy; Effort adaptation; Hyperparameter optimization; Ensemble; Empirical experiments,"Phannachitta, P",2020.0,Journal,INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.infsof.2020.106330,"[Phannachitta, Passakorn] Chiang Mai Univ, Coll Arts Media & Technol, 239 Suthep, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand",ELSEVIER,English,0950-5849,
WoS,A large scale study on how developers discuss code smells and anti-pattern in Stack Exchange sites,"Context: In this paper, we investigate how developers discuss code smells and anti-patterns across three technical Stack Exchange sites. Understanding developers perceptions of these issues is important to inform and align future research efforts and direct tools vendors to design tailored tools that best suit developers. Method: we mined three Stack Exchange sites and used quantitative and qualitative methods to analyse more than 4000 posts that discuss code smells and anti-patterns. Results: results showed that developers often asked their peers to smell their code, thus utilising those sites as an informal, crowd-based code smell/anti-pattern detector. The majority of questions (556) asked were focused on smells like Duplicated Code, Spaghetti Code, God and Data Classes. In terms of languages, most of discussions centred around popular languages such as C# (772 posts), JavaScript (720) and Java (699), however greater support is available for Java compared to other languages (especially modern languages such as Swift and Kotlin). We also found that developers often discuss the downsides of implementing specific design patterns and 'flag' them as potential anti-patterns to be avoided. Some well-defined smells and anti-patterns are discussed as potentially being acceptable practice in certain scenarios. In general, developers actively seek to consider trade-offs to decide whether to use a design pattern, an anti-pattern or not. Conclusion: our results suggest that there is a need for: 1) more context and domain sensitive evaluations of code smells and anti-patterns, 2) better guidelines for making trade-offs when applying design patterns or eliminating smells/anti-patterns in industry, and 3) a unified, constantly updated, catalog of smells and anti-patterns.

Objective: Different than the basic developer information displayed on OSS platforms, we propose portraying developers as a quick approach for characterizing and understanding them. We discuss how to build developer portraits to make them concise yet informative. Method: We propose a mull-dimensional developer portrait model to specify the attributes of various aspects concerning software development about developers. Then, a method that leverages text analysis, web data analysis, and code analysis techniques is presented to analyze a developer's various sources of data on OSS platforms for constructing the portrait. Results: The constructed portraits can be vividly displayed on the web to help people quickly understand developers and make better decisions during collaborative software development. Case studies on two representative problems in the software engineering area-code recommendation and programming task assignment-are conducted, and the results show the improvement in recommendation and the potential for proper assignments when using our portraits.

This relatively low enthalpy return fluid, which will otherwise be reinjected back into the earth, will be utilized as the thermal energy source of the chiller. Although such chillers are considered low-grade energy refrigeration cycles, the one proposed here has an advantage in terms of economy and efficiency. A parametric analysis is performed using Engineering Equation Solver software and is used to highlight the effect of the heat exchanger size on the coefficient of performance of the chiller. The analysis proved that the proposed device can operate with excellent cooling capacity, reaching 16 kW, and a relatively high coefficient of performance (similar to 0.7) while being driven by the low-grade energy. The heat source temperature, solution heat exchanger effectiveness and the size of the absorber were shown to be key parameters for the design and operation of absorption chillers.

This fault-tolerant capability is highly appreciated by industry for security and economic reasons.

Even though this is done at the software stage, the obligation to identify the faulty phases and store the modifications for every fault scenario adds further complexity.

WoS,T-A-Formulation to Model Electrical Machines With HTS Coated Conductor Coils,"Modeling high temperature superconductor (HTS) motors remains challenging mainly due to the high aspect ratio of these conductors but also because of the properties of the magnetic materials. This article presents a 2-D time dependent model to assess the ac losses of superconducting motors based on the new T-A-formulation, which by using the finite-element method, allows its implementation in commercial software. The T-A-formulation computes the magnetic flux density with different Maxwell's equations depending on the areas of the motor and makes it possible to use the thin strip approximation i.e., the HTS tapes are modeled as infinitely thin lines. The model is then expected to tackle the high aspect ratio of the HTS as well as decreasing both the mesh complexity and the computing time. The first objective of the article is to validate the method in 2-D by evaluating the ac losses of a specific synchronous motor called superconducting torque motor; the computed results are compared with good agreements to those assessed with the minimum electromagnetic entropy production method, already validated. In a second part, the same losses are computed, taking into account the field anisotropy of $J_{c}$ with the implementation of a dataset based on experimentally measured $I_{c}$ at 65 and 77 K.

WoS,New QSAR models to predict chromosome damaging potential based on the in vivo micronucleus test,"A large number of computer-based prediction methods to determine the potential of chemicals to induce mutations at the gene level has been developed over the last decades. Conversely, only few such methods are currently available to predict potential structural and numerical chromosome aberrations. Even fewer of these are based on the preferred testing method for this endpoint, i.e. the micronucleus test. For the present work, in vivo micronucleus test results of 718 structurally diverse compounds were collected and applied for the construction of new models by means of the freely available SARpy in silico model building software. Multiple QSAR models were created using parameter variation and manual verification of (non-) alerting structures. To this extent, the original set of 718 compounds was split into a training (80 %) and a test (20 %) set. SARpy was applied on the training set to automatically extract sets of rules by generating and selecting substructures based on their prediction performance whereas the test set was used to evaluate model performance. Five different splits were made randomly, each of which had a similar balance between positive and negative substances compared to the full dataset. All generated models were characterised by an overall better performance than existing free and commercial models for the same endpoint, while demonstrating high coverage.",Chromosome damage; In vivo micronucleus; Genotoxicity; QSAR; In silico model,"Van Bossuyt, M; Raitano, G; Honma, M; Van Hoeck, E; Vanhaecke, T; Rogiers, V; Mertens, B; Benfenati, E",2020.0,Journal,TOXICOLOGY LETTERS,10.1016/j.toxlet.2020.04.016,"[Van Bossuyt, Melissa; Van Hoeck, Els; Mertens, Birgit] Sciensano, Sci Direct Chem & Phys Hlth Risks, Brussels, Belgium; [Van Bossuyt, Melissa; Vanhaecke, Tamara; Rogiers, Vera] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Vitro Toxicol & Dermato Cosmetol, Brussels, Belgium; [Raitano, Giuseppa; Benfenati, Emilio] Ist Ric Farmacol Mario Negri IRCCS, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Milan, Italy; [Honma, Masamitsu] Natl Inst Hlth Sci, Div Genet & Mutagenesis, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan",ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,English,0378-4274,
WoS,The prevalence and severity of persistent ambiguity in software requirements specifications: Is a special effort needed to find them?,"Context and motivation: All the research in methods and tools for avoiding, detecting, and removing ambiguities in requirements specifications assumes that doing so is necessary and that the methods and tools for doing so are worth the effort to use them. Each of two attempts by de Bruijn et al. and Philippo et al. to test these assumptions empirically with a case study examined a random sampling of the ambiguities in the requirements specification for already constructed software. Each study concluded that ambiguities in the examined requirements specification did not result in any serious defects in the downstream development and seem to have been resolved through the normal multiple inspections and discussions that characterize a serious requirements engineering process. Question/problem: However, because each study examined only a small random sampling of the many ambiguities in its specification, it may have missed the rare ambiguity that causes a serious defect in the constructed software. Moreover, as a case study, its results cannot be generalized. So the unanswered questions are: (1) How prevalent are ambiguities that cause defects? and (2) What kinds of defects do these ambiguities cause? Principal idea/Goal: The research reported in this paper tried hard to falsify de Bruijn's and Philippo's result in three different case studies, each with a requirements specification and already developed software. Each study used a purposive sampling of the ambiguities in its requirements specification to find those ambiguities that are least likely to have been discussed and resolved during the inspections and discussions about the specifications in an attempt to find undetected ambiguities that caused or can cause major defects in the implemented software. The purposive sampling was to identify types of ambiguity, called persistent ambiguities of which many people are not aware; which, therefore, will not come up in any of the discussions about the requirements; and which will persist into the implementation to cause defects. After obtaining the persistent ambiguities in the project's requirements specification, we asked the project's chief requirements engineer if any of them caused or can cause serious defects in the project's software. Conclusion/Contribution: For the three projects, none of the sampled ambiguities reviewed by each chief requirements engineer caused expensive damage because all of the project's requirements engineers seem to have subconsciously disambiguated the ambiguities in the same way. The first main conclusion is that persistent ambiguities remain undetected during requirements engineering and the subsequent development. The second main conclusion is that a serious requirements engineering process is sufficient to cause all project stakeholders to disambiguate, consciously or not, all ambiguities, persistent or not, in a requirements specification the same way; thus, ambiguities, while present in the specification, do not cause defects in the downstream software. The third main conclusion is that the identification of persistent ambiguities in a requirements specification is potentially an effective and efficient strategy for minimizing damage caused by ambiguity precisely because of its focus on ambiguities that remain undetected due to lack of awareness. Further study is necessary to determine what factors are involved in persistent ambiguity and its prevalence, as well as its potential impacts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Improving the success rate of applying the extract method refactoring,"Context: Most modern programming environments support refactorings. Although refactorings are relevant to improve the quality of software source code, they unfortunately suffer from severe usability issues. In particular, the extract method refactoring, one of the most prominent refactorings, has a failure rate of 49% when users attempt to use it. Objective: Our main objective is to improve the success rate of applying the extract method refactoring. Methods: First, to understand the cause of refactoring failure, we conducted a partial replication of Vakilian's ICSE '14 study about usability issues of refactoring using IntelliJ IDEA. Second, we designed and implemented TOAD, a tool that proposes alternative text selection for source code refactoring for the Pharo programming language. Third, we evaluated TOAD using a controlled experiment against the standard Pharo code refactoring tool. Seven professional software engineers complemented with three undergrad students participated in our experiments. Conclusion: The causes we identified of failed extract method refactoring attempts match Vakilian's work. TOAD significantly reduces the number of failed attempts to run the extract method refactoring at a lower cognitive load cost. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,The Prevalence of Students and Teachers' Ideas about Global Warming and the Use of Renewable Energy Technology,"This study aims to explore the prevalence of students' and teachers' ideas about global warming and the use of renewable energy technology in Gorontalo, Indonesia. Employing a non-experimental quantitative approach, the data were collected from 1522 respondents and analyzed with the WINSTEPS 3.73 Rasch software. This study reports that 97.6% and 76.08% of the respondents respectively understand the concepts of global warming and renewable energy from the internet (45%) and formal education (<40%). Respondents' level/status of education, gender, and home-town cause some differences in their ideas prevalence. High school students consider that utilizing renewable energy is not crucial; they also do not concern about global warming effects and the environment. Teachers and university students do not believe that using renewable energy can produce sustainable energy; they also question the safety of renewable energy technology. These findings indicate the needs for a renewable energy literacy program in formal education in Indonesia. (C) 2020 L&II Scientific Publishing. LLC.

However, solar trackers are vulnerable to failure or collapse, due to aerodynamic loads. This study analyses a dual-axis tracking model, using finite elements numerical modelling, to assess its structural stability and fatigue under static and cyclic loads. A rectangular solar tracker, with an area of 27.4 m(2) is investigated, using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 software. The results demonstrate that the maximum von Mises stress obtained is 92.51 MPa, which is less than the yield stress (200 MPa), and that the resulting safety value is 2.16. The maximum settlement obtained is 19 mm. In addition, the maximum usage fatigue factor obtained is 0.046. The study therefore concludes that the solar tracker structure satisfies the design requirements of the stability and fatigue criteria. Moreover, it concludes the ground concerned is stable, and exhibits only a slight amount of settlement that falls within the acceptable range, according to geotechnical engineering design.",Tracking systems; Photovoltaic; Finite element; Stability; Fatigue; Settlement,"AL-Rashidi, A",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE,10.21660/2020.73.46434,"[AL-Rashidi, Abdulla] Publ Author Appl Educ & Training, Dept Civil Engn, Kuwait, Kuwait",GEOMATE INT SOC,English,2186-2982,
WoS,CHARACTERISTICS OF OUTDOOR THERMAL COMFORT INDEX (OCTI) AT MANDEH TOURISM SITE,"Tourism is one of the fast growing business sectors today. Outdoor Thermal Comfort Index (OCTI) is useful information for tourists. The study was conducted at the Mandeh tourist area. OCTI is calculated based on climate data for the 1979-2015 period. RayMan software is used to calculate OCTI expressed in Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET). Calculation results show that the characteristics of the annual OCTI in Mandeh are dominated by the Slightly Warm category (98%) and Comfortable (2%). Characteristics of daily OCTI: morning (00 utc) and evening (18 utc) are dominated by the Comfortable (90%) and Warm (10%) categories. During the day (06 utc) the Slightly warm category (60%) and Comfortable (90%). Towards night (12 utc), a more diverse OCTI category emerged: Comfortable (7%), Slightly Warm (31%), Warm (41%), Hot (20%), and Very Hot (1%). The unique characteristics of OCTI at this time are thought to be because the location of the data sample taken is in a bay, where the PET value is not only influenced by surface air temperature at the location but also the presence of ocean-land interactions which causes the PET value to be unique at that time. During 1979-2015, there was a shift in PET, where the trend in the Slightly Warm category continued to increase and the Comfortable category declined. For tourists, the characteristics of OCTI can be used as a guide when the right time for a vacation and for tourism businesses and local governments as a guide for tourism development in Mandeh.",Tourism; Outdoor thermal comfort index; PET; Mandeh,"Wilis, R; Nugroho, S; Barlian, E; Syah, N",2020.0,Journal,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE,10.21660/2020.73.ICGeo47,"[Wilis, Ratna] Padang State Univ, Doctoral Program Environm Sci, Padang, Indonesia; [Wilis, Ratna; Barlian, Eri; Syah, Nurhasan] Padang State Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Geog, Padang, Indonesia; [Nugroho, Sugeng] BMKG, Padang Pariaman Climatol Stn, Jakarta, Indonesia",GEOMATE INT SOC,English,2186-2982,
WoS,Moderators of treatment efficacy in individualized metacognitive training for psychosis (MCT plus ),"Background and objectives: Individualized Metacognitive Training (MCT + ) is a manualized intervention designed to improve delusional severity by reducing delusion-associated cognitive biases such as jumping-to-conclusions. Increased interest in personalized medicine stipulates the identification of patients who are more likely to benefit from specialized interventions. The present study aimed to explore baseline moderators of MCT + efficacy on delusions and overall positive symptoms in psychosis. Methods: We analyzed data from a randomized rater-blind controlled trial, in which 92 patients with psychotic disorders and current or past delusions were randomly assigned to either MCT + or CogPack (R), a cognitive remediation software. Baseline moderator variables consisted of jumping-to-conclusions, cognitive insight, quality of life, self-esteem, selective attention, and patients' attitudes towards their symptoms. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to investigate specific moderators of MCT + efficacy. Results: In MCT + relative to CogPack, presence of a jumping-to-conclusions bias, a lowered decision threshold, and low self-esteem were associated with larger improvements in delusional severity and/or overall positive symptoms over time. Subjective reasoning style and insight, as well as subjective attitudes towards psychosis, did not moderate the treatment efficacy of MCT + relative to CogPack. Limitations: Participation of both treatment groups in group MCT as a part of standard care, possibly leading to additional effects on delusional severity. Conclusions: Patients with low self-esteem and those who are prone to jumping-to-conclusions seem to particularly benefit from MCT +. Our results can help inform clinical practice as they provide specific criteria for selecting patients for whom MCT + is most appropriate.",Schizophrenia; Metacognition; Moderation; Jumping-to-conclusions; Self-esteem; Efficacy,"Leanza, L; Studerus, E; Bozikas, VP; Moritz, S; Andreou, C",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY,10.1016/j.jbtep.2020.101547,"[Leanza, Letizia; Andreou, Christina] Univ Basel, Psychiat Hosp, Ctr Psychot Disorders, Basel, Switzerland; [Leanza, Letizia] Univ Basel, Dept Psychol, Div Clin Psychol & Epidemiol, Basel, Switzerland; [Studerus, Erich] Univ Basel, Dept Psychol, Div Personal & Dev Psychol, Basel, Switzerland; [Bozikas, Vasilis P.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat 2, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Moritz, Steffen] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Hamburg, Germany",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0005-7916,

WoS,MOVA/MOSS: Two integrated software solutions for comprehensive Structural Health Monitoring of structures,"Recent ground-breaking advances in sensing technologies, data processing, and structural identification have made Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) occupy a central place in Structural Engineering. Although the technological transfer to the industry is still in the early development stages, there is clear evidence that SHM-enabled condition-based maintenance of structures will soon supersede traditional periodic maintenance strategies. Among the existing solutions, ambient vibration-based SHM has become particularly popular owing to its minimum intrusiveness and global damage assessment capabilities. Nevertheless, it is well documented that local pathologies with limited impact over the stiffness of structures can be hardly detected by such techniques. As a solution, recent studies advocate the use of integrated monitoring systems, where data from heterogeneous sensor networks are simultaneously processed to achieve a comprehensive structural assessment. Despite the great advances of these systems reported by researchers, practitioners still find many difficulties to bring them to practice. In this light, this paper reports the development of two novel software solutions for long-term SHM of structures, MOVA and MOSS, that are intended to bridge this gap while also introducing new methodological and scientific advances. The developed software enables the online system identification and damage detection of structures, including vibration-based SHM and data fusion of heterogeneous sensing systems with an innovative automated anomaly detection algorithm. A case study of a permanent static/dynamic/environmental monitoring system installed in a monumental masonry palace, the Consoli Palace in Gubbio (Italy), is presented to illustrate the capabilities of MOVA/MOSS.

WoS,A 3-D Strong-Coupled Electromagnetic-Thermal Model for HTS Bulk and Its Uses to Study the Dynamic Characteristics of a Linear HTS Maglev Bearing,"Thermal effect will greatly affect the engineering performance of high-temperature superconductors (HTSs) due to its strong dependence of electromagnetic parameters upon the local temperature. To advance the understanding of such thermal effects, a validated 3-D strong-coupled electromagnetic-thermal model for HTS bulk was established in commercial finite-element software COMSOL, which ensures the easy access and universality of the model. J(c)(B,T) was employed to reflect both magnetic field and thermal field dependences of HTS in this model. In addition, the thermal transient equation and convective boundary condition were employed with experimentally measured HTS thermal conductivity and heat capacity to describe the thermal flux exchange between HTS and cryogenic medium. As an example of application, the established electromagnetic-thermal model was tailored to study the dynamic characteristics of a linear HTS magnetic levitation (maglev) bearing. The methodologies to numerically study the dynamic response of the linear HTS maglev bearing under free vibration state and typical operating excitations, e.g., earthquake, track irregularity, and crosswind, were put forward in this article. The influences of field cooling height, preload, and ambient temperature, were also studied, and promising methods to improve the system stability were put forward according to the obtained conclusions. The above-mentioned results are reasonable and keep in concert with former experimental and theoretical studies. Moreover, some results which are inaccessible in the 2-D models, for instance, the thermal field distribution inside HTS bulk, can also be obtained due to the versatility of the 3-D model. To conclude, the established HTS electromagnetic-thermal model could serve as a flexible and extensible simulation tool to study various applications of HTS bulk. Besides the application in linear HTS maglev bearing, which was systematically studied in this article, other potential applications, such as thermal analysis of HTS bulk in pulse magnetization process and HTS bulk-based electrical machines, can also be expected in future work.",Dynamic characteristics; high-temperature superconductors (HTSs); magnetic levitation (maglev); permanent magnet (PM); strong-coupled multiphysical model,"Yang, WJ; Queval, L; Ma, GT; Ye, CQ; Li, G; Gong, TY",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY,10.1109/TASC.2020.2982879,"[Yang, Wenjiao; Ma, Guangtong; Ye, Changqing; Li, Gang; Gong, Tianyong] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Tract Power, Appl Superconduct Lab, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China; [Queval, Loic] UPMC, CNRS, UMR 8507, Grp Elect Engn Paris,CentraleSupelec,UPSud, Gif Sur Yvette 91192, France",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,English,1051-8223,
WoS,Efficient Algorithms for Delay-Aware NFV-Enabled Multicasting in Mobile Edge Clouds With Resource Sharing,"Stringent delay requirements of many mobile applications have led to the development of mobile edge clouds, to offer low latency network services at the network edges. Most conventional network services are implemented via hardware-based network functions, including firewalls and load balancers, to guarantee service security and performance. However, implementing hardware-based network functions usually incurs both a high capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX). Network Function Virtualization (NFV) exhibits a potential to reduce CAPEX and OPEX significantly, by deploying software-based network functions in virtual machines (VMs) on edge-clouds. We consider a fundamental problem of NFV-enabled multicasting in a mobile edge cloud, where each multicast request has both service function chain and end-to-end delay requirements. Specifically, each multicast request requires chaining of a sequence of network functions (referred to as a service function chain) from a source to a set of destinations within specified end-to-end delay requirements. We devise an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for a single multicast request admission if its delay requirement is negligible; otherwise, we propose an efficient heuristic. Furthermore, we also consider admissions of a given set of the delay-aware NFV-enabled multicast requests, for which we devise an efficient heuristic such that the system throughput is maximized, while the implementation cost of admitted requests is minimized. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in a real test-bed, and experimental results show that our algorithms outperform other similar approaches reported in literature.",Multicast communication; Delays; Multicast algorithms; Approximation algorithms; Cloud computing; Optical switches; Network function virtualization; Mobile edge clouds; network function virtualization; multicasting; approximation algorithms; algorithm design,"Ren, HZ; Xu, ZC; Liang, WF; Xia, QF; Zhou, P; Rana, OF; Galis, A; Wu, GW",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS,10.1109/TPDS.2020.2983918,"[Ren, Haozhe; Xu, Zichuan; Xia, Qiufen; Wu, Guowei] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Software, Key Lab Ubiquitous Network & Serv Software Liaoni, Dalian 116620, Peoples R China; [Liang, Weifa] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Comp Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Zhou, Pan] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Rana, Omer F.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales; [Galis, Alex] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,English,1045-9219,
WoS,An Event-Driven Approach to Serverless Seismic Imaging in the Cloud,"Adapting the cloud for high-performance computing (HPC) is a challenging task, as software for HPC applications hinges on fast network connections and is sensitive to hardware failures. Using cloud infrastructure to recreate conventional HPC clusters is therefore in many cases an infeasible solution for migrating HPC applications to the cloud. As an alternative to the generic lift and shift approach, we consider the specific application of seismic imaging and demonstrate a serverless and event-driven approach for running large-scale instances of this problem in the cloud. Instead of permanently running compute instances, our workflow is based on a serverless architecture with high throughput batch computing and event-driven computations, in which computational resources are only running as long as they are utilized. We demonstrate that this approach is very flexible and allows for resilient and nested levels of parallelization, including domain decomposition for solving the underlying partial differential equations. While the event-driven approach introduces some overhead as computational resources are repeatedly restarted, it inherently provides resilience to instance shut-downs and allows a significant reduction of cost by avoiding idle instances, thus making the cloud a viable alternative to on-premise clusters for large-scale seismic imaging.",Cloud computing; Imaging; Mathematical model; Computational modeling; Numerical models; Propagation; Benchmark testing,"Witte, PA; Louboutin, M; Modzelewski, H; Jones, C; Selvage, J; Herrmann, FJ",2020.0,Journal,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS,10.1109/TPDS.2020.2982626,"[Witte, Philipp A.; Louboutin, Mathias; Herrmann, Felix J.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Computat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA; [Modzelewski, Henryk] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Jones, Charles; Selvage, James] Osokey Ltd, Henley On Thames RG9 1AY, England",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,English,1045-9219,

Since the nanoparticles stability is an important issue, this article is aiming to study the long-term stability associated with the development of an immunosensor for clinical diagnosis. Here, we assessed two previous methods commonly described in the literature to prevent the formation of aggregate by studying pH and Tween (R) 20 (polysorbates) addition as surfactant. AuNPs were characterized through ultraviolet- visible (UV-Vis), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and through analysis in the ImageJ software. We found that the Tween (R) 20 provided more than stable condition in aqueous solution in comparison to pH dependence. The fabricated AuNPs were further used to detect dengue virus and demonstrating that its use at pH 7.2 did not maintain reproducibility in the detection of dengue virus after one year. Unlike, the Tween (R) 20 modified AuNPs that detected dengue virus soon after the synthesis and over the course of one year demonstrating the high sensitivity of immunosensor.

WoS,Wear Behavior of the Human Enamel Antagonist to Different Glazed Zirconia,"In this study, the wear behavior of glazed zirconia was investigated to the antagonist with human enamel after simulated mastication. Twenty Y-TZP specimens were divided into 4 groups: untreated zirconia (Z), glazed zirconia with IPS e.max Ceram (GZE), glazed zirconia with VITA AKZENT (R) Plus (GZV), and glazed zirconia with glass (GZG). Glazing glass was mainly composed of SiO2, B2O3, Al2O3, Na2O and K2O (nearly 91 wt%). The surface roughness of the specimens was evaluated using roughness profiler. The maxillary premolar teeth were selected as the antagonist. The wear of human enamel against human enamel was used as a control. Five-disc specimens per group were subjected to chewing stimulation CS-4 (SD Mechatronic GmbH, Germany) for 240,000 cycles against human enamel. The wear loss of antagonistic teeth was calculated using a three-dimensional profiling system and the volume loss of the tooth was scanned using a 3D scanner. 3D data obtained before and after testing were overlapped using 3D software (Dentacian Software, EZplant, Korea). The wear loss of glazed zirconia GZE, GZV and GZG groups showed significantly lower than that of human enamel. Whereas, the zirconia (Z) group exhibits significantly lower volume loss than glazed zirconia and enamel. These results show that the wear of the glazing glass is comparable to other commercial glazing materials.

WoS,Voltage stability assessment and enhancement of power grid with increasing wind energy penetration,"This paper presents the voltage stability assessment of power system with increasing wind energy penetration. The effects of increasing Doubly-Fed Induction Generator-based Wind Energy Conversion System (DFIG-WECS) penetration in the power system have been investigated in this work. Active Power-Voltage (PV) analysis was employed to determine the voltage stability limits in terms of the maximum loadability limit within which stable operation of the grid can be guaranteed as the wind energy penetration increases. The analyses in this work were carried out both for normal and contingency operations of the grid. IEEE 14-bus test system was used as the study case. Simulations were carried out using DigSilent PowerFactory software and results analyses were done using MATLAB. Furthermore, the effects of integrating DFIG-WECS on the loading of essential power system equipment are investigated. The results show that the maximum loadability limit of the study system increases with increasing DFIG-WECS power penetration up to 100%.

WoS,An integrated scheme for a directional relay in the presence of a series-compensated line,"This paper presents an integrated method to identify the fault direction in the presence of a series compensator via also identifying the power flow direction. The presented method relies on monitoring both measured angle of the positive-sequence (PS) currents and magnitude of PS voltage. The change of PS voltage magnitude is used to detect the current inversion case. The presented criteria depend on the power flow direction before the fault occurrence. Therefore, a power flow direction identification method is presented using only the change of the phase angle of the PS current. Different system configurations are investigated to test the reliability of the proposed protection scheme (PPS). The power and protection systems' configurations contain different capacitor ratios leading to current and voltage inversion scenarios, reversing the power flow direction and single-pole tripping.

Therefore, in this paper, a new strategy is presented using CSD with PIR-CB to mitigate the level of switching surge during energization/re-energization of Shunt-Compensated Transmission Line (SCTL). The proposed methodology requires lineside voltage measurement during the dead time of CB. The performance of the proposed methodology has been evaluated by modelling an existing Indian 400 kV, 400-km long SCTL using PSCAD/EMTDC software package. Moreover, its performance remains unaffected during wide variation in the length of the line, level of compensation, type of fault, duration of fault, fault inception angle, fault location, short circuit capacity of source, and inclusion/removal of Switching Arrestor (SA). At the end, comparative evaluation of the proposed methodology with the reported methodology clearly shows its effectiveness in terms of reduction in the level of the switching surge considering Mechanical Operating Time (MOT) scatter of the CB.

In this system, STATCOM has been used as a parallel compensator for improving reactive power of the wind farm, and HVDC is employed to improve damping of transmission line connected to the power system. The proposed method is based on two internal and external control loops. The internal control loop is used to apply the switching signals suitable for the rotor-side converter in DFIG, HVDC's converter, and the STATCOM inverter.

The algorithm is independent of fault impedance and knowing of faulty phases is not required.

WoS,"Two decades of oligotrophication: Evidence for a phytoplankton community shift in the coastal lagoon of Thau (Mediterranean Sea, France)","Mediterranean costal lagoons have been exposed to anthropic eutrophication for decades. Thau lagoon is one of the largest among them and provides many ecosystem services including shellfish farming. Considerable efforts were made between the 1970s and the late 2000s to improve the wastewater treatment systems in the lagoon watershed. A decrease in nutrient inputs to Thau lagoon was subsequently observed, evidence for the start of a recovery process in Thau lagoon, following oligotrophication. This decrease has significant consequences for ecosystem communities, above all primary producers. In our study, we characterised and quantified long-term changes by analysing long monitoring time-series (1998-2016) of phytoplankton biomass, abundance and composition of the taxa, nutrients and climate conditions, using univariate and multivariate statistics. Our results revealed that two decades of mitigation actions in the Thau lagoon watershed have led to a significant progressive reduction in nutrient concentrations and in phytoplankton biomass (-60%), associated with a decrease in diatom abundance (-66%), particularly affecting Skeletonema spp. The changes were associated with a community shift characterised by a shift in phytoplankton taxonomic dominance from Skeletonema-Chaetoceros to Chaetoceros-Pseudo-nitzschia. The median proportion of dinoflagellates relative to diatoms increased, although the total dinoflagellate abundance did not change significantly. We hypothesise that the shift in phytoplankton communities is the result of the mixed effects of the reduction in nutrient inputs and of climatic-related variables. Finally, we present a conceptual scheme of the main drivers of phytoplankton community structure to clarify the ecosystem functioning of a Mediterranean lagoon used for shellfish farming, under oligotrophication and climate change.",Eutrophication; Oligotrophication; Nutrients; Recovery; Phytoplankton community shift; Mediterranean coastal lagoon,"Derolez, V; Soudant, D; Malet, N; Chiantella, C; Richard, M; Abadie, E; Aliaume, C; Bec, B",2020.0,Journal,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106810,"[Derolez, Valerie; Chiantella, Claude; Richard, Marion; Abadie, Eric] Univ Montpellier, IRD, IFREMER, CNRS,MARBEC, F-34203 Sete, France; [Soudant, Dominique] Ifremer VIGIES, F-44311 Nantes 03, France; [Malet, Nathalie] Ifremer LERPAC CO, F-20600 Bastia, France; [Aliaume, Catherine; Bec, Beatrice] Univ Montpellier, IFREMER, CNRS, MARBEC,IRD, F-34095 Montpellier, France",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0272-7714,
WoS,MGMS2: Membrane glycolipid mass spectrum simulator for polymicrobial samples,"Rationale Polymicrobial samples present unique challenges for mass spectrometric identification. A recently developed glycolipid technology has the potential to accurately identify individual bacterial species from polymicrobial samples. In order to develop and validate bacterial identification algorithms (e.g. machine learning) using this glycolipid technology, generating a large number of various polymicrobial samples can be beneficial, but it is costly and labor-intensive. Here, we propose an alternative cost-effective approach that generates realisticin silicopolymicrobial glycolipid mass spectra. Methods We introduce MGMS2 (membrane glycolipid mass spectrum simulator) as a simulation software package that generatesin silicopolymicrobial membrane glycolipid matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra. Unlike currently available simulation algorithms for polymicrobial mass spectra, the proposed algorithm considers errors inm/zvalues and variances of intensity values, occasions of missing signature ions, and noise peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first stand-alone bacterial membrane glycolipid mass spectral simulator. MGMS2 software and its manual are freely available as an R package. An interactive MGSM2 app that helps users explore various simulation parameter options is also available. Results We demonstrated the performance of MGSM2 using six microbes. The software generatedin silicoglycolipid mass spectra that are similar to real polymicrobial glycolipid mass spectra. The maximum correlation betweenin silicomass spectra generated by MGMS2 and the real polymicrobial mass spectrum was about 87%.

WoS,A multimodal imaging study of brain structural correlates of schizotypy dimensions using the MSS,"Schizotypy is a multidimensional construct of subclinical schizophrenia-like behavioural traits and cognition. The recently developed multidimensional schizotypy scale (MSS) provides an improved psychometric assess-ment of the three main dimensions (positive, negative, and disorganised). We tested the hypothesis that the three dimensions are related to brain structural variation in the precuneus and fronto-thalamo-striatal system in a new non-clinical healthy cohort to support a dimensional model of the psychosis spectrum. We analysed data from 104 subjects with Multidimensional Schizotypy Scale (MSS) phenotyping and 3 Tesla magnetic resonance images using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) applying CAT12 software, and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) with TBSS in FSL to test for correlations with MSS scores. MSS subscales and total score were negatively associated with GMV in brain areas including the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and lateral prefrontal and orbital cortex. MSS schizotypy was associated with white matter integrity in anterior thalamic radiation, un-cinate fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Our findings provide first direct evidence for an asso-ciation of schizotypy (as a psychosis risk phenotype) and the fronto-thalamo-striatal system, in both grey and white matter with regionally diverging effects across single dimensions.

Despite the large number of traditional detection solutions that exist currently, DDoS attacks continue to grow in frequency, volume, and severity. This paper brings an analysis of the problem and suggests the implementation of four machine learning algorithms (SVM, MLP, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) with the purpose of classifying DDoS attacks in an SDN simulated environment (Mininet 2.2.2). With this goal, the DDoS attacks were simulated using the Scapy tool with a list of valid IPs, acquiring, as a result, the best accuracy with the Random Forest algorithm and the best processing time with the Decision Tree algorithm.

WoS,A trust management framework for software-defined network applications,"The emergence of software-defined network (SDN) has brought unprecedented innovation to current networks. SDN's two most notable features are decoupling and programmability. Decoupling makes network management centralized in a control plane. Meanwhile, having benefitted from the programmable characteristic of SDN, new functions of networking can be easily realized. However, these features also introduce new security issues to SDN. Through the programming interface provided by SDN, software engineers can easily develop network applications to generate networking policies for SDN's control planes for the purpose of guiding network routing. However, it is hard to guarantee the security and quality of these new applications. Malicious or low-quality applications could damage a whole network. To solve this problem, we propose a novel trust management framework for SDN applications in this paper. It can evaluate applications' trust values based on their impact on the network performance (such as time delay, packet loss rate, throughput, etc). These trust values further play a decisive role for managing and selecting applications in SDN.

In this study, the cDNA and genomic sequences of prkaca in tilapia hybrids (Oreochromis mossambicus x Oreochromis hornorum) were cloned and analysed. The results showed the prkaca gene consists of 11 exons and 10 introns, and its protein contains 351 amino acid residues and is clustered with Oreochromis niloticus, Maylandia zebra and Haplochromis burtoni first in a phylogenetic tree. Amino acid alignment indicates that prkaca shares the highest identity (100%) to Oreochromis niloticus, Maylandia zebra and Haplochromis burtoni. Two CpG islands of prkaca were found by MethPrimer software, and 32 CG sites were found in the proximal promoter. The methylation level of prkaca in the hybrids (0.31%) was significantly lower than that of their parents (0.94% and 3.43%) in kidney tissue (P < 0.05). The gene expression levels and DNA methylation levels of prkaca in muscle and kidney tissues of the tilapia hybrids were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR and showed a negative correlation under saline-alkali stress.

WoS,Pooled genetic analysis identifies variants that confer enhanced susceptibility to PCOS in Indian ethnicity,"Background: PCOS is a common endocrine disorder that is characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation and is the leading cause of female infertility. It is a heterogeneous disorder with the involvement of multiple gene and environmental interactions. This study identified variants that are known to confer susceptibility identified by Genome wide association studies (GWAS) in other ethnicities and replicated the same in individuals with PCOS of Indian ethnicity. Methods: Study subjects (n = 600) were recruited. Blood samples, demographic and clinical details were collected after obtaining informed consent. Fifteen variants were selected from GWA studies from other ethnicities and genotyped in half of the recruited samples (n = 300) using MassARRAYiPLEX (TM). Replication of significant variants generated from preliminary data was carried out by PCR and direct sequencing in remainder of the samples (n = 300). Insilco analysis for significant variants was performed using software namely CADD, GWAVA, FATHMM-MKL. Relevant statistics were used to ascertain significance. Results: The mean age of patients and controls was 24.26 +/- 3.22 and 30.19 +/- 11.21 years respectively. Of the 15 variants, 3 variants (rs13405728 in LHCGR; rs13429458 in THADA and rs2209972 IDE genes) were found to be associated with PCOS. The association was successfully replicated in an independent cohort. Insilico analysis categorized two variants (rs13429458-THADA and rs2209972-IDE genes) as deleterious. Conclusion: We demonstrate the association of variants in genes namely LHCGR, THADA and IDE with an in-creased risk of PCOS.

WoS,Assessing socio-environmental sustainability at the level of irrigation and drainage network,"Assessing pre- vs. post environmental and social effects of present irrigation projects is vital to provide sustainable socio-environmental roadmaps for the upcoming similar development projects. Such sustainability was assessed for the first time in the present study at a 20-year old irrigation and drainage network (TIDN) area in the north of Iran covering about 70 thousands ha. A 32-year period data on groundwater level and surface- and groundwater quality as well as data on harvested area and crop production was analyzed to evaluate environmental sustainability. Inverse distance weighting (IDW) method was used to prepare the zoning maps and to analyze the descriptive data. Social response to the TIDN was assessed using a cross-sectional survey through completing a questionnaire. The raw data obtained from the questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS software. During the operation of the TIDN, the cropping area increased gradually from about 34,000 ha to about 53,000 ha. In this period, the average yield of early- and late-matured rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties, predominant crops grown in the area, increased steadily from about 5300 to 6700 kg ha(-1). Groundwater table depth declined gradually with an annual reduction of 7.5 cm mainly due to agricultural intensification. Groundwater quality parameters such as electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and magnesium decreased substantially especially in the semi-deep wells, while nitrate concentration showed a little increase without human effects. The TIDN project improved rural sustainability, hope feeling, security feeling, tourism development, cultural development, trust, social solidarity, social participation and life quality. The results indicate that similar comprehensive analyses can provide an important contribution to assess socio- environmental sustainability in irrigated catchments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Up to lowest 100 frequencies of rectangular plates using Jacobi polynomials and TSNDT,"This paper finds up to lowest 100 free vibration frequencies of isotropic and linearly elastic plates with thickness to side length ratio varying from 0.001 to 0.5 by using the Ritz method, a third-order shear and normal deformable plate theory (TSNDT), and weighted Jacobi polynomials as admissible functions that are mutually orthogonal and exactly satisfy essential boundary conditions. The numerical method is stable even for 18th degree polynomials as basis functions. It is shown that this approach requires fewer degrees of freedom than those in the traditional finite element method (FEM) to find converged lowest 100 frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes. No shear correction factor is employed in the TSNDT. The presently computed results agree well with those from either analytical or numerical solutions of the corresponding 3-dimensional linearly elastic problems obtained with the commercial FE software, Abaqus.

WoS,Study on the forest road pavements reinforced with geogrids by using the 2D FEM method,"The forest road pavements ensure the transportation of wood from the primary platform to the public road. The traffic has seen a rapid development in terms of transportation capacity. Thus, the forest road pavements are subjected to increasing traffic pressures. To respond, the researchers come up with the optimisation of the road pavement by using geogrids. The main purpose of this study is to present the behaviour of forest pavements reinforced with geogrids under the traffic load. The calculation of the stress-strain state was performed by using the finite element method. Therefore, within its first part, the paper presents the results similarity for the calculation of forest road pavements by using softwares such as Calderom 2000, ANSYS and Rubicon ToolBox. The second part approaches the consolidation of road pavements with geogrids to reduce the elastic vertical deformations of pavements. Findings of this study revealed that the 2D FEM method and ANSYS software offer similar results when compared to classical software. The geogrids located at various heights of the pavement produced different vertical elastic deformations and the increase of their modulus of elasticity did not seem to be cost-effective. However, when doubled, the average elastic deformation was found of about 2.49%.",2D FEM; geogrid; pavement; strain; elastic deformation; ANSYS,"Bratu, CA; Ciobanu, VD; Derczeni, RA; Salca, EA",2020.0,Journal,ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN,10.1080/14680629.2019.1566085,"[Bratu, Constantin-Alexandru; Ciobanu, Valentina Doina; Derczeni, Rudolf Alexandru] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Silviculture & Forest Engn, Brasov, Romania; [Salca, Emilia-Adela] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Wood Engn, Brasov, Romania",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,English,1468-0629,
WoS,Early versus delayed removal of indwelling urinary catheter after elective cesarean delivery: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background:Timing of removal of the indwelling urinary catheter after elective cesarean delivery (CD) is controversial. Early removal could be associated with fewer urinary symptoms. Objective:This review aims to evaluate the evidence from published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) about the outcomes of early versus delayed removal of indwelling urinary catheter after elective cesarean delivery (CD). Data sources:Electronic databases were searched using the following MeSH terms (early Or Late Or immediate OR delayed removal) AND (Urinary catheter) AND (cesarean section OR cesarean delivery OR CS) Methods of study selection:All RCTs assessing the timing of removal of urinary catheter were considered for this meta-analysis. One hundred seventy-two studies were identified of which three studies deemed eligible for this review. Quality and risk of bias assessment were performed for all studies. Data extraction:Two researchers independently extracted the data from the individual articles and entered into RevMan software. The relative risk (RR), the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The extracted outcomes were significant bacteriuria, urinary symptoms (urinary retention necessitating re-catheterization, dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency) postoperative oral rehydration and length of hospital stay. Results:Three RCTs (early removal:n = 298 and delayed removal:n = 311) were included. The pooled estimate showed that early removal significantly reduced dysuria (RR = 0.60, 95% CI [0.38, 0.95],p=.03), urinary frequency (RR = 0.32, 95% CI [0.16, 0.66],p=.002) and significant bacteriuria (RR = 0.49, 95% CI [0.30, 0.83],p=.007) than delayed removal.

WoS,An online stochastic algorithm for a dynamic nurse scheduling problem,"In this paper, we focus on the problem studied in the second international nurse rostering competition: a personalized nurse scheduling problem under uncertainty. The schedules must be computed week by week over a planning horizon of up to eight weeks. We present the work that the authors submitted to this competition and which was awarded the second prize. At each stage, the dynamic algorithm is fed with the staffing demand and nurses preferences for the current week and computes an irrevocable schedule for all nurses without knowledge of future inputs. The challenge is to obtain a feasible and near-optimal schedule at the end of the horizon. The online stochastic algorithm described in this paper draws inspiration from the primal-dual algorithm for online optimization and the sample average approximation, and is built upon an existing static nurse scheduling software. The procedure generates a small set of candidate schedules, rank them according to their performance over a set of test scenarios, and keeps the best one. Numerical results show that this algorithm is very robust, since it has been able to produce feasible and near optimal solutions on most of the proposed instances ranging from 30 to 120 nurses over a horizon of 4 or 8 weeks. Finally, the code of our implementation is open source and available in a public repository. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

WoS,Optimal selection and release problem in software testing process: A continuous time stochastic control approach,"This paper studies a joint selection of test cases and release problem for a software under test with predetermined classes of test cases and release time deadline. The software test manager can make three alternative choices dynamically during software testing progress before the deadline: continue testing and select a class of test cases, release the software, or scrap the software, with the objective of minimizing the cumulative testing cost plus penalty cost after releasing or scrapping the software. We formulate the problem as a continuous time stochastic control model and provide a mathematically rigorous method to establish the concavity of the optimal cost function. Based on this property, we are able to characterize that the optimal release policy has a threshold structure. Moreover, the thresholds are founded to be monotone in the residual time length in the case of homogeneous release cost. Besides, we put forward a method based on low convex envelope and discover that the optimal selection policy also has a threshold or other simple structure, if the running cost or the removal cost is the same for all classes. Finally, we present an approximation algorithm of computing the optimal cost function, by which some numerical examples are studied to justify our theoretical results and the robustness of our policy. We also conduct a case study to compare our dynamic selection and release testing policy with two other commonly used testing policies and find that our policy is the best in most instances.

However, these algorithms are not tuned for the visualization of binary data and none of them consider the hubness of observations for the visualization. In order to address these limitations, here we propose hubViz, a novel tool for hub-centric visualization of binary data. We evaluated the performance of hubViz with its application to the gene expression data measured in multiple brain regions of rats exposed to cocaine, the single-cell RNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with interferon beta, and the literature mining data to investigate relationships among diseases. We further evaluated the performance of hubViz using simulation studies. We showed that hubViz provides effective visual inspection by locating the hub in the center and the contrasting elements in the opposite sides around the center. We believe that hubViz and its software can be powerful tools that can improve visualizations of various genomic data.

The result is an automatically generated peak table that provides integrated peak areas for the inputted samples. The software was tested against a simulated dataset, whereby the number of detected features highly correlated to the number of actual features (r(2) = 0.95). This software has also been developed to include random forests, a discriminant analysis technique that generates prediction models for application to unknown samples with different chemical signatures. In an example dataset described herein, the model achieves 3% classification error with 12 trees and 0% classification error with 48 trees.

WoS,Experimental investigation on the motion response of a novel floating desalination plant for Egypt,"Increasing water demand in remote coastal areas in Egypt has shifted attention to the role of floating desalination plants to alleviate water shortages. A novel mobile floating desalination plant is proposed for Ras Ghareb city in Egypt. The compatibility between floater natural periods and the energy excitation range of waves in deployment area can lead to resonance responses. Therefore, understanding the motions behaviour among waves of such floaters at a particular location is important for its safety, performance and operation. The goal of the present study is to investigate the suitability of proposed concept for Egyptian environment conditions by characterising the behaviour of the plant motion responses during its entire deployment conditions. Based on full scale design of the proposed plant, experimental study over a range of wave heights and frequencies was performed in the present study using a 1:100 scale model test. In order to identify the plant natural frequency and damping ratio, free decay and swinging tests were performed for different load conditions. Different wave heights were tested during the experiments in order to investigate the effect of wave height on the heave and pitch responses at plant natural frequencies. The experimental test results were compared with numerical results from frequency domain program HydroD implemented in Sesam DNV GL software package. Results show that heave and pitch motion responses give the closest agreement between the measurements and numerical predictions over the whole range of wave periods except the peak spike. The proposed cylindrical FDP is compared against a conventional ship FPSO concept widely used for offshore freshwater production and it was concluded that new cylindrical FDP shows better motion responses compared to conventional ship FPSO concept in same wave bands in Egypt.",Offshore platform; Seawater desalination; Dynamic response of offshore structure,"Amin, I; Dai, SS; Oterkus, S; Day, S; Oterkus, E",2020.0,Journal,OCEAN ENGINEERING,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.107535,"[Amin, Islam] Port Said Univ, Dept Naval Architecture & Marine Engn, Port Fouad City, Egypt; [Amin, Islam; Dai, Saishuai; Oterkus, Selda; Day, Sandy; Oterkus, Erkan] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,0029-8018,
WoS,Mapping the spatial distribution of emissions from domestic shipping in Izmir Bay,"The purpose of this study is to determine the risky areas in terms of air pollution from domestic shipping in Izmir Bay with the integration of Geographic Information System (GIS) and emission evaluation methodology. To do this, initially, the emissions as a result of 435 trips of 19 ships engaged in domestic transportation in Izmir Bay were evaluated by the bottom-up method. The spatial distribution map was then compiled using the point density analysis through MapInfo v.16 software as a GIS instrument. The study revealed that annual emissions of PM10,CO2,NOx, SO2, and HC from domestic shipping were 601.5 t, 925.9 t, 62612.1 t, 22.0 t, and 61.2 t, respectively. In addition, the highest emissions as ton per daily trip were recorded in the cruising mode due to longer operation periods compared to the other modes. It was found that the lines between Pasaport, Alsancak and Karsiyaka piers are the most polluted routes due to dense ship traffic. Furthermore, Bostanli and Karsiyaka piers were determined as the points with the lowest air quality due to heavy traffic. We concluded that the ship emissions do not spread homogeneously throughout the region. In order to reduce the emissions in the area, the number of daily voyages and ship size should be optimized for passenger and vehicle density.

WoS,Adequacy evaluation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics methods for simulating the external-flooding scenario,"In modern nuclear risk analysis for external-flooding scenarios, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools are used to simulate the generation, propagation, and interactions of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) with the nuclear Systems, Structures, and Components (SSCs). Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), as a Lagrangian and mesh-free method, is one of the particle-based CFD methods. Since SPH methods can effectively handling large-scale fluid simulations with complex interfacial structures, SPH-based software has been used to simulate the impacts of external flood onto nuclear facilities, and the simulation results have been used to support nuclear safety analysis. However, previous risk analysis assumes that SPH methods and the corresponding simulation packages are applicable to the external-hazards risk analysis, and their simulation uncertainties do not affect the confidence of safety decision. Considering the high consequences to nuclear safety induced by simulation errors, a systematic and complete validation process is needed to evaluate the adequacy of SPH simulations in informing related safety decisions. In this study, a scoping-stage assessment is performed for SPH's adequacy in simulating the real-scale external flooding scenarios, especially in predicting the surface-wave impacts on SSCs at NPP sites. To ensure the completeness and consistency, validation frameworks, Code Scalability Applicability and Uncertainty (CSAU), and its regulatory guide, Evaluation Model Development and Assessment Process (EMDAP) are followed to guide validation activities and to make final code adequacy assessment. First, an external-flooding scenario is designed, and SPH simulations are performed with an SPH-based software named Neutrino. A Phenomenon Identification and Ranking Table (PIRT) is created, and the surface-wave impacts are identified as one of the high-rank phenomena. At the same time, a performance measurement standard is created for measuring the code adequacy in informing safety decisions consistently and transparently. Next, numerical benchmarks are designed for assessing the code adequacy of SPH methods and corresponding software implementations on Neutrino. Next, code accuracy is evaluated by comparing simulation results from Neutrino against experimental measurements in each benchmark. Meanwhile, a scaling analysis is performed to determine a group of dimensionless number for characterizing important physics and to assess the applicability of validation database collected in reduced-scale facility to the prototypic scenario. Finally, results from all activities are brought together to make an adequacy decision. It is found that, based on the current evidence, SPH methods and associated Neutrino software can predict the unbroken surface-wave peak pressure onto stationary rigid with reasonable accuracy if the suggested sizes of particles are used. However, it is suggested by independent reviews that the validity of major assumptions in target applications need to be evaluated with large-scale experiments, and the relevancy of other phenomena like turbulence and air pockets need to be identified with more benchmarks. As for the SPH's adequacy in predicting the impact forces on dynamic rigid, the available evidence is not sufficient to support the decisions.",External flooding; CSAU/EMDAP; Validation; Scaling; SPH,"Lin, LY; Montanari, N; Prescott, S; Sampath, R; Bao, H; Dinh, N",2020.0,Journal,NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN,10.1016/j.nucengdes.2020.110720,"[Lin, Linyu; Dinh, Nam] North Carolina State Univ, 2500 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Montanari, Niels; Sampath, Ram] Centroid LAB Inc, 12777 W Jefferson Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90066 USA; [Prescott, Steven; Bao, Han] Idaho Natl Lab, 2525 Fremont Ave, Idaho Falls, ID 83402 USA",ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,English,0029-5493,
WoS,Parcellation-based modeling of the dorsal premotor area,"Background: The dorsal premotor area (DPM) plays an important role in hand coordination and muscle recruitment for lifting activities. Lesions in the area have demonstrated that the DPM is critical in the integration of movements that require combinations of reaching, grasping, and lifting. While many have looked at its functional connectivity, few studies have shown the full anatomical connectivity of DPM including its connections beyond the motor network. Using region-based fMRI studies, we built a neuroanatomical model to account for these extra-motor connections. Objective: In this study, we performed meta-analysis and tractography with the goal of creating a map of the dorsal premotor network using the Human Connectome Project parcellation scheme nomenclature (i.e. the Glasser Atlas). While there are other possible ways to map this, we feel that it is critical that neuroimaging begin to move towards all of its data expressed in a single nomenclature which can be compared across studies, and a potential framework that we can build upon in future studies. Methods: Thirty region-based fMRI studies were used to generate an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) using BrainMap software (Research Imaging Institute of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio). Cortical parcellations overlapping the ALE were used to construct a preliminary model of the Dorsal Premotor Area. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) based tractography was performed to determine the connectivity between cortical parcellations and connections throughout cortex. The resulting connectivities were described using the cortical parcellation scheme developed by the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Results: Three left hemisphere regions were found to comprise the Dorsal Premotor Area. These included areas 6a, 6d. and 6v, Across mapped brains, these areas showed consistent interconnections between each other. Additionally, ipsilateral connections to the premotor cortex, sensorimotor cortex, superior and inferior parietal lobule, middle and inferior frontal gyrus, and insula were demonstrated. Connections to the contralateral supplementary motor area and premotor cortex were also identified. Conclusions: We describe a preliminary cortical model for the underlying structural connectivity of the Dorsal Premotor Area. Future studies should further characterize the neuroanatomic underpinnings of this network.",Dorsal premotor; PMd; Parcellation; Tractography,"Sheets, JR; Briggs, RG; Bai, MY; Poologaindran, A; Young, IM; Conner, AK; Baker, CM; Glenn, CA; Sughrue, ME",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES,10.1016/j.jns.2020.116907,"[Sheets, John R.; Briggs, Robert G.; Conner, Andrew K.; Baker, Cordell M.; Glenn, Chad A.] Univ Oklahoma, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Oklahoma City, OK USA; [Bai, Michael Y.; Sughrue, Michael E.] Prince Wales Private Hosp, Ctr Minimally Invas Neurosurg, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Poologaindran, Anujan] Univ Cambridge, Brain Mapping Unit, Cambridge, England; [Young, Isabella M.] Cingulum Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia",ELSEVIER,English,0022-510X,
WoS,Sustainability evaluation of biomass direct gasification using chemical looping technology for power generation with and w/o CO2 capture,"Sawdust direct gasification using chemical looping with hematite as an oxygen carrier was investigated in a 10 kW(th) interconnected fluidized bed reactor. This was used to develop a biomass chemical looping gasification combined cycle (BCLGCC) model using Aspen Plus software. A technical analysis of a scaled up, simulated and validated 650 MW power plant using BCLG experimental results and industrial data was conducted. The analysis focused on investigating critical parameters that have a significant effect on syngas quality and quantity, hence optimizing the gasification process to obtain higher energy efficiencies for subsequent power generation. An economic and sustainability assessments comparing BCLGCC with 4 different power generation technologies with and w/o CCS was performed. BCLGCC presents promising economic and environmental results, showing that the efficiencies of the CCS and Non-CCS plants are equal to 36% and 41%, respectively, with a COE (including government renewable energy subsidies) for both CCS and Non-CCS equal to 15.9 cent/kWh and 12.8 cent/kWh, both of which are lower than the average COE in the UK (approximately 17.7 cent/kWh). This highlights the technical and economic potential and feasibility of BCLGCC compared to conventional power generation processes while promoting Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology.

WoS,Energy and exergy analyses of a new integrated thermochemical copper-chlorine cycle for hydrogen production,"This paper presents a thermodynamic study on a newly built lab-scale thermochemical copper-chlorine (Cu-Cl) cycle installed at the Clean Energy Research Laboratory (CERL) at the Ontario Tech University. This study analyzes every component of the system through energy and exergy analysis by considering the heat inputs, outputs and exergy destruction within the various units of the Cu-Cl cycle. The system is modeled and simulated using the Aspen-plus software. The mass, energy and exergy balance equations for each system component are written for analysis and assessment purposes. Based on the analysis, the maximum heat input is required for the hydrolysis reactor while the HCl-condenser-1 is found to reject the maximum heat. The results suggest that the thermolysis reactor experienced the highest exergy destruction. The effect of the flow rates of certain species within the cycle on the performance of various system units, such as heat transfer rates and production flow rates are also investigated.

The radiation attenuation features of these glasses were investigated by determining different factors including mass attenuation coefficient (mu/p), exposure and absorption buildup factors (EBF and EABF), neutron removal cross section (NRCS), and effective atomic number (Z(eff)) for photon, proton, and carbon ion interactions. Geant4 toolkit and Phy-X program were employed for simulations and calculations procedures. The results revealed that NiO content in the studied bioactive glasses has a significant effect on photon interaction and an insignificant effect on the charged particle interactions.

WoS,Effect of in situ SiC and MoSi2 phases on the oxidation behavior of HfB2-based composites,"Monolithic HfB2 and HfB2-15vol%SiC-15vol%MoSi2 composite samples were oxidized by a conventional electric furnace at 1700 degrees C for 5 h. Microstructural and phase analysis of the oxidized samples were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with energydispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Besides, for analyzing the oxidation mechanism of the samples, thermodynamic calculations were also accomplished by HSC software. The changes in weight and thickness of the oxide scale were measured and the oxide growth rate of the oxidized samples was subsequently calculated. The results showed that HfB2-15vol%SiC-15vol%MoSi2 composite was much more resisted than that monolithic HfB2 due to the formation of a thin Si-rich glass layer on the surface of the composite sample. By acting to fill the porosities between HfO2 grains, Si-based glass phase enhanced the oxidation resistance of HfB2-15vol%SiC-15vol%MoSi2 composite. Conversely, the oxidized monolithic HfB2 had only a thick porous oxide layer (HfO2) which led to considerably lower oxidation resistance. On the other side, three layers containing HfO2 and Si-based glass phases were formed on the oxidized HfB2-15vol%SiC-15vol%MoSi2 composite. Moreover, no porosities and no porous layers were also detected on the oxidized composite sample. Consequently, HfB2-15vol%SiC-15vol% MoSi2 composite had a parabolic behavior owing to its diffusion-controlled oxidation under the isothermal oxidation process.",HfB2-SiC-MoSi2 composite; Oxidation behavior; Si-based phase,"Ghadami, S; Taheri-Nassaj, E; Baharvandi, HR; Ghadami, F",2020.0,Journal,CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.116,"[Ghadami, S.; Taheri-Nassaj, E.; Ghadami, F.] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, POB 14115-143, Tehran, Iran; [Baharvandi, H.

WoS,Dynamic levitation behavior of a radial-type SMB under axial load condition,"Due to the external disturbances or the time-variable load, it is necessary to study the dynamic levitation behavior in order to guarantee the stable levitation of superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB). This paper investigates the dynamic levitation behaviors of a radial-type SMB under axial load condition. By adopting the Power-law EJ relation, the simplified H-formulation finite element model of a radial-type SMB was established to calculate the axial dynamic levitation behavior with the aid of the PDE module and ODE module in software COMSOL. The experimental measurements of the axial levitation force were performed in the field cooling condition so as to validate the model. Then, the dynamic levitation behaviors of the radial-type SMB were discussed when the PM rotor suffers from the external disturbances including the axial constant load with different initial velocities and the sinusoidal time-variable loads. The results show that both the load size and the initial velocity drift the work point of PM rotor. And the sinusoidal load leads to a complex time-evolution of the levitation behavior.

WoS,"Role of Bi2O3 in altering the structural, optical, mechanical, radiation shielding and thermoluminescence properties of heavy metal oxide borosilicate glasses","With the main intention of developing a transparent radiation shielding as well as a gamma dosimetric material, a series a heavy metal oxide borosilicate glass of composition (60-x) B2O3- 20SiO(2)- xBi(2)O(3)- 10ZnO- 10BaO with x = 0, 5, 10, 15 mol% was prepared by melt- quench technique. The glasses obtained were all transparent, except Bi-15 sample which is opaque and black in colour. The darkening is due to thermal reduction of Bi3+ ions, which is clearly indicated by absorption band around 377nm. XRD patterns showed the absence of crystalline peaks even in the opaque Bi-15 sample, confirming the glassy nature of all glasses. Furthermore, the structural changes in the glasses were confirmed with density measurement and FTIR studies. The Vickers hardness test done on transparent samples proved their higher mechanical strength, along with the theoretical calculation of elastic constants. The detailed analysis of gamma and neutron radiation shielding parameters for all the glasses was done using Photon Shielding and Dosimetry (PSD) software. The results suggested that the T-ray shielding capacity increased, whereas the neutron attenuation ability decreased with the successive addition of Bi2O3. The opacity of Bi-15 can create problem in certain applications where transparency is needed. In order to assess the possibility of transparent glasses to be used as gamma dosimeter, they were irradiated with gamma rays of 1.25 MeV and thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves were recorded. An interesting behaviour of quenching of TL intensity for initial addition and enhancement of TL intensity for further addition of Bi2O3 was observed.

WoS,Energy management strategies comparison for a parallel full hybrid electric vehicle using Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition combustion,"Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition combustion technology potentials are well known for the capability to drastically reduce the engine-out nitrogen oxides and soot emissions simultaneously. Its implementation in mid-term low-duty diesel engines can be beneficial to meet the upcoming regulations. To explore the potential of this solution, experimental data are used from a compression ignition 1.9 L engine, which is operated under two combustion-modes: Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition and conventional diesel combustion. Meanwhile, also the carbon dioxide emissions limitations must be fulfilled. To achieve this goal, the benefits associated to powertrain electrification in terms of fuel economy, can be joined with the benefits of RCCI combustion. To do so, two different supervisory control strategies are compared: Adaptive Equivalent Minimization Control Strategy and Rule-Based Control strategy, while dynamic programming is used to size the electric grid of the powertrain to provide the best optimal solution in terms of fuel economy and emissions abatement. The analysis of the designed hybrid powertrain is carried out numerically with GT-Suite and Matlab-Simulink software. The results show a great potential of the parallel full-hybrid electric vehicle powertrain equipped with the dual-mode engine to reduce the engine-out emissions, also to increase fuel economy with respect to the homologation fuel consumption of the baseline vehicle. The optimal supervisory control strategy was found to be the emissions-oriented Adaptive Equivalent Minimization Control Strategy, which scores a simultaneous reduction of 12% in fuel consumption, 75% in engine-out nitrogen oxides emissions and 82% in engine-out soot, with respect to the baseline conventional diesel combustion engine vehicle.",RCCI; Energy management; ECMS; Hybrid powertrain; Emissions regulations,"Garcia, A; Carlucci, P; Monsalve-Serrano, J; Valletta, A; Martinez-Boggio, S",2020.0,Journal,APPLIED ENERGY,10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115191,"[Garcia, Antonio; Monsalve-Serrano, Javier; Martinez-Boggio, Santiago] Univ Politecn Valencia, CMT Motores Term, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 45022, Spain; [Carlucci, Paolo; Valletta, Andrea] Univ Salento, Piazza Tancredi 7, I-73100 Lecce, Italy",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0306-2619,

A customized software application (app) installed on a smartphone to receive data from the sensing layer by BLE4.0 can display and analyze real-time wound temperature. Our system had high monitoring sensitivity and stability, good stretchability, excellent reliability and biocompatibility. It was applied to a pig skin wound model to reveal temperature fluctuation during the entire wound regeneration process. As a credible reference and foundation for further early warning of an adverse event, three main phases of temperature fluctuation were found: the rising phase (below 39 degrees C), plateau phase (39-39.5 degrees C), and falling phase (below 39 degrees C), which were accompanied by significant wound biological events, including inflammatory cell infiltration, angiogenesis and wound healing.

WoS,Hypothesis of thermal and mechanical energy storage with unconventional methods,"There is not a real storage market and the range of technical solutions for electrical storage appears to be underdeveloped. The use of electrochemical batteries seems to be the easiest and cheapest way, but some problems related to disposal, average life span and storage capacity, still put a brake on their diffusion. The micro CAES-TES (Compressed Air Energy Storage - Thermal Energy Storage) systems with small renewable energy plants for cogeneration and trigeneration represent an important development perspective thank to the reuse of the heat generated at the stage of air compression (for heating) and air expansion (for cooling). This improves the complexity of the entire system because of the heat exchange and thermal storage units must match the capacities and performances of the air compression/expansion units. The paper presents a new mathematical model for micro CAES-TES systems, implemented in Matlab software environment. The novelty is the use of air compressed energy storage in small and residential applications, a trigeneration due to reuse of heat from air compression and expansion stage, only renewable energy used. By keeping the initial investment low, the analysis is extended to the optimal system configuration and identifies key parameters that have a dominant influence on improving system efficiency and provides useful guidance for CAES-TES system design. The results show that, for an air storage volume of 4 m(3), the optimal configuration is with a compression ratio of 15 splitted in two stages, charging time 5 h, mechanical storage efficiency 48%, compression air flow rate 3.73 kg/hour.

WoS,Assessing the reliability of an automated system for mineral identification using LWIR Hyperspectral Infrared imagery,"Application of hyperspectral infrared imagery for mineral grain identification suffers from a lack of prediction on the irregular grain's surface along with the mineral aggregates. Here, we present an investigation to determine the reliability of automatic mineral identification in the longwave Infrared (LWIR, 7.7-11.8 mu m) with an LWIR-macro lens having a spatial resolution of 100 mu m. We attempt to identify eleven different mineral grains (biotite, epidote, goethite, diopside, smithsonite, tourmaline, kyanite, scheelite, pyrope, olivine, and quartz). A machine learning-based algorithm (implemented by software) compares all of the pixel-spectra to the ASTER spectral library of JPL/NASA using spectral angle mapper (SAM) and normalized cross-correlation (NCC) to create false-color maps. Then a hue-saturation-value (HSV) principle component analysis (PCA) based K-means clustering approach groups the mineral regions in different categories. The results were compared to two different ground truths (GT) (i.e. rigid-GT and observed-GT) for quantitative calculation and as an integrated step for validating our approach.

WoS,Automatic deployment and control of network services in NFV environments,"With the rapid development and deployment of the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology, the number and types of Network Services (NSs) in virtualized environments keep increasing significantly. However, due to the dynamic network and service status, manually customizing an NS in an NFV environment is a professional, time-consuming and error-prone task, and there is an urgent need to develop a new mechanism to automate the deployment and control process of NSs. In this work, we propose a novel Software Defined NS Deployment and Control mechanism (SDNSDC) in NFV environments. By executing the uniquely defined NS deployment and control description files, one can have the orchestrator to generate some specific virtualized middleboxes, based on which the predefined NS functions can be further configured in the NFV network. Finally, a prototype system of the proposed SDNSDC has been implemented based on the Linux container technology. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can efficiently deploy customized network services and accurately control their behaviors.",Network function virtualization; Network services; Deployment and control of network services; Software-defined networks,"Chen, M; Zhang, SK; Deng, H; Chen, B; Xing, CY; Xu, B",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS,10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102677,"[Chen, Ming; Zhang, Shunkang; Deng, Hai; Chen, Bing] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Xing, Changyou; Xu, Bo] Army Engn Univ PLA, Command & Control Engn Coll, Nanjing, Peoples R China",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,1084-8045,
WoS,Optimizing AP and Beacon Placement in WiFi and BLE hybrid localization,"Nowadays, wireless communication techniques, such as WiFi, Bluetooth low energy (BLE), etc., have been pervasive in our daily lives, and not only provide convenient data transmission services, but also enable popular indoor positioning and navigation services. The placement of wireless infrastructures like WiFi access points (APs) and BLE beacons have significant influences on the performance of localization. More importantly, since APs and beacons are probably used for both network access and localization, it is necessary to take into account both coverage and localization when deploying APs and beacons. In addition, there still exist other critical challenges, including optimizing AP and beacon placement in WiFi and BLE hybrid localization and optimizing the placement of extra APs and/or beacons in an existing wireless network, which are essentially NP-complete. This paper tackles these problems of optimizing AP and beacon placement by proposing a heuristic differential evolution algorithm based on the widely used Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). To be specific, the CRLB is leveraged as a metric for localization and meanwhile a coverage degree criterion is defined as a metric for coverage, both of which are incorporated into the evaluation function of the differential evolution algorithm. Furthermore, instead of using the ideal log distance path loss (LDPL) model, the more practical Motley-Keenan model is adopted to reflect the influences of obstacles that are widespread in indoor environments. On these grounds, a software is designed and implemented based on Geotools to optimize AP and beacon placement in an interactive GUI manner. Finally, extensive simulations and field experiments are conducted, and a thorough comparison confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",AP and Beacon; WiFi and BLE Hybrid localization; Coverage; Differential evolution algorithm; Cramer-rao lower bound; Heterogeneous wireless networks,"Tian, Y; Huang, BQ; Jia, B; Zhao, L",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS,10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102673,"[Tian, Yu; Huang, Baoqi; Jia, Bing] Inner Mongolia Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Long] Beihang Univ, Sch Automat Sci & Elect Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,1084-8045,
WoS,Mitigating LFA through segment rerouting in IoT environment with traceroute flow abnormality detection,"The Internet of Things (IoT) provides tremendous smart devices that are always connected to and interacting with the Internet. However, the development of IoT also promotes the threat of network attacks due to the billions of IoT devices vulnerable to hackers. Link-flooding attack (LFA) is a new type of DDoS attack used to flood the crucial network links. In IoT environment, LFA can be more easily launched by large-scale low-rate legitimate data flows with quite a low cost and is difficult to detect. Target areas in an enterprise network can be easily isolated since the crucial links are unavailable. Software defined network (SDN) architecture provides new opportunities to address this network security problem with the separation of data plane and control plane. Recently, segment routing (SR), which is an evolution of source routing, has been viewed as a promising technique for flow rerouting and failure recovery. SR is a lightweight easy-deployed scheme known for its flexibility, scalability, and applicability. Therefore, in this paper, we try to mitigate LFA with segment rerouting within the SDN architecture. With the comprehensive network-wide view of the data flows and links, we first design a monitoring mechanism to detect LFA based on the availability of the crucial links and traceroute flows. We consider the traceroute packet flows as time series with white Gaussian noise. A machine-learning-based auto-regression scheme is proposed to detect the abnormal increase in traceroute packets which indicates the launch of LFA. Then we use segment routing to detour the congested flows and alleviate the burden on the crucial links. Finally. the LFA bots will be identified and the malicious traffic will be blocked. Sufficient evaluations demonstrate that our LFA defense can efficiently detect LFA and preserve the network services, while only introduce a little signaling overhead between the control and data plane.",Machine learning; Internet of things; Link-flooding attack; Segment rerouting; Software-defined network; Traceroute flow,"Xie, LX; Ding, Y; Yang, HY; Hu, Z",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS,10.1016/j.jnca.2020.102690,"[Xie, Lixia; Ding, Ying; Yang, Hongyu; Hu, Ze] Civil Aviat Univ China, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Tianjin 300300, Peoples R China",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,English,1084-8045,
WoS,Experimental investigation and numerical analysis of RC beams shear strengthened with FRP/ECC composite layer,"Five Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams strengthened with Basalt Fiber Reinforced Polymer (BFRP) grid in conjunction with Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) were tested along with one conventional RC beam for reference to investigate their performance improvement, particularly in shear capacity, due to strengthening. The test results highlighted that the failure modes of the tested beams were dominated with shear-compression failure in the shear/bending moment regions and concrete crushing in the compression part of the pure bending zone. A good bonding performance between the BFRP-ECC composite and concrete substrate was exhibited during the testing process, which can effectively suppress the propagation of diagonal cracks in the shear/bending moment regions. The shear capacity of strengthened RC beams was greatly improved with the increase of BFRP grid reinforcement ratio. Moreover, the reinforcement effect of this strengthening technique was much more effective with the increase of shear-span ratio of the tested RC beams. Furthermore, finite element analyses based on ABAQUS/Standard software were conducted to provide analytical estimations of the shear capacity of the strengthened RC beams. The analytical results revealed that the predicted values agree very well with the test data, which can effectively predict the shear capacity of RC beams strengthened with BFRP-ECC composite.",BFRP grid; Engineered cementitious composite; Finite element analysis; Shear capacity; Strengthening,"Zheng, YZ; Wang, WW; Mosalam, KM; Fang, Q; Chen, L; Zhu, ZF",2020.0,Journal,COMPOSITE STRUCTURES,10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112436,"[Zheng, Yu-Zhou; Fang, Qin; Chen, Li] Army Engn Univ PLA, State Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Mitigat Explos &, Nanjing 21000, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yu-Zhou; Fang, Qin; Chen, Li] Army Engn Univ PLA, Sch Field Engn, Nanjing 21000, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yu-Zhou; Wang, Wen-Wei; Zhu, Zhong-Feng] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing 210018, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yu-Zhou; Mosalam, Khalid M.] Pacific Earthquake Engn Res Peer Ctr, Richmond Field Stn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chen, Li] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Nanjing 210018, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,English,0263-8223,

The irregular SRC joints are inevitably appeared in the main plant due to the limitations of power generation technology and equipment. In this paper, quasistatic cyclic tests were carried out on three 1:4 reduced scale irregular external SRC joints to discuss the seismic performance of the joints in the NPP, mainly including the damage pattern, hysteretic behavior, load carrying capacity, stiffness degradation and ductility. In addition, the detailed 3D finite element (FE) models were established, in which the bond-slip behavior between the shaped steel and concrete was considered by using the developed software to add a huge number of non-linear spring elements, and the FE models were verified by the test results.

WoS,Environmental impact assessment of air-permeable plastic runway production in China,"With the rapid development of plastic runways in China, incidents of toxic runways that are detrimental to human health frequently occurred. This phenomenon has resulted in public concern on the safety and cleanliness of plastic runways. To improve the sustainability of these runways, the environmental performance of the produced plastic runways should be evaluated. The critical hotspots for plastic runway studies should be determined, and a cleaner optimization path of critical materials should be explored. In this study, a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) on the air-permeable plastic runway was conducted. The green factory formula was identified, and the environmental impacts of the production process were quantitatively analyzed. Detailed life cycle inventory data were obtained from the on-site survey of typical plastic runway manufacturer enterprises in China. Environmental impacts were calculated using the CML 2001 method built into the GaBi 8.0 software. Results indicated that the 1: 7 ratio of polyurethane adhesive to ethylene-propylene-diene monomer rubber particles was the greenest formula with the least environmental impact. The environmental hotspots were from the front-end of raw material production during the mixing phase and the biomass steam input during the curing phase. The characteristic pollutants generated from mixing phase were CO2, methane, NOx, and VOCs, whereas those from the curing phase were CO2, NOx, SO2, freon, HCl, and NH3. Moreover, methylene diisocyanate (MDI) was the cleaner raw material for air-permeable plastic runway production, because the environmental impact of producing an equal mass of MDI was 39%-89% of that by toluene diisocyanate. Thus, this LCA study presents a strategy for the sustainable improvement of air-permeable plastic runway production and also proposes policy recommendations for decision makers.

A low-cost infrared sensor (around $5) was adapted in a disposable, polystyrene vessel for monitoring the temperature to determine the endpoint of neutralization, redox, and complexation titrations, using a homemade syringe pump to titration control. Open-source software was developed to control the device using the Raspberry Pi platform and to perform automatic endpoint determination. The influence of sample volume, the flow rate of titrant, and sensor distance from the solution were evaluated to lower the variation among measurements. The parameters chosen in this regard were 10 mL of sample, 0.8 mL min(-1) of titrant solution flow rate, and 3 cm of distance from the sensor to the solution. Results for the determination of the acidity of sauces and the ascorbic acid and calcium content of pharmaceutical products were compared with those from official compendia. The performance of the sensor also was compared with an infrared camera. The proposed method agreed with conventional ones to an extent ranging from 93% to 106%.

WoS,Synthesis of putrescine-imprinted double-layer nanofiber membrane by electrospinning for the selective recognition of putrescine,"In this work, we have developed a double-layer nanofiber membrane (NFM) with high selectivity based on molecular imprinting technique by electrospinning methods and applied it in recognizing putrescine. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was used as spinning solution, 1,4-butylene glycol as the imitate template, and ninhydrin as chromogenic agent. The adsorption of the putrescine is corresponded to purple-color stains on the NFM, which is digitizing intuitively by the ImageJ software. By quantifying the gray value of the stains on the NFM, its imprinting efficiency (IE) is estimated. The adsorption performance of the double-layer molecular imprinted NFM was studied in detail, showing higher adsorption capacity (71.912 mg mL(-1)), shorter adsorption equilibrium time of 40 min and higher selectivity to putrescine than our previous works. Furthermore, the material showed remarkable selectivity for putrescine with respect to other three kinds of aliphatic amine in similar molecular structure. The selectivity coefficient (alpha) of putrescine against cadaverine, spermine, and spermidine are calculated to be 1.734, 2.224, and 2.576, respectively. In addition, since PVA is a water-soluble material, the NFM is not reusable. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

WoS,3D printed catalytic converters with enhanced activity for low-temperature methane oxidation in dual-fuel engines,"Catalytic converters with non-linear channel structures were prepared using 3D printing and tested in the oxidation of methane in a simulated dual-fuel engine exhaust stream. The design used a simple repeating angular offset between adjacent layers, which was sufficient to introduce complexity with minimal software programming. All 3D printed substrates were mechanically stable and, following washcoating with a composite catalyst, demonstrated higher catalytic activity in methane oxidation than a commercial honeycomb substrate. The methane conversion at e.g. 510 degrees C was 12.6% on the commercial sample, 72.6% for 90 degrees, 80.1% for both 30 degrees and 45 degrees, and 89.6% for the 60 degrees oriented structures. This enhancement is attributed to the increased turbulence/mass transfer and surface area than are possible using conventional straight-channelled substrates. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis confirmed that the higher methane conversion over 3D printed substrates is due (at least partially) to its higher turbulence kinetic energy.

It was found to be a powerful catalyst for the Sonogashira, Suzuki, and C-N cross-coupling reactions in water as a green solvent without the need for any external base. Fe3O4@PEG/Cu-Co was well characterized with FT-IR, FE-SEM, TEM, VSM, EDX, ICP, UV-visible, CV, and XPS analyses. Optimum ranges of parameters such as time, temperature, and amount of catalyst were investigated by Design-Expert 10.0.7 software for C-C Suzuki, Sonogashira, and C-N cross-coupling reactions to find the optimum conditions. The catalyst was compatible with a variety of aryl halides andN-arenes and gave favorable coupling products with good to high yields for all of them. Hot filtration and Hg poisoning tests involving the nanocatalyst revealed the stability, low metal leaching, and heterogeneous nature of the catalyst. Reaction mechanisms were proposed by study of the UV-visible spectrain situas well as hydroquinone tests during the progress of reactions.In situXPS analysis was also used to study the reaction mechanism. To prove the synergistic performance of Co and Cu in the catalyst, its various homologues were synthesized and applied to a model reaction separately, and then their catalytic activities were investigated.

WoS,"CK2 inhibition, lipophilicity and anticancer activity of newN(1)versus N-2-substituted tetrabromobenzotriazole regioisomers","A new series of antiproliferative casein kinase 2 alpha (CK2 alpha) inhibitors were synthesized incorporating either a hydrophilic group (carboxylic or hydrazide) or a hydrophobic group (ester) atN(1)orN(2)of 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBBt). New compounds were preparedvia N-alkylation of TBBt followed by base-catalysed hydrolysis or hydrazinolysis. All the compounds demonstrated low sub-micromolar inhibition of CK2 alpha and antiproliferative activity against both breast and lung cancer cell lines (MCF-7, and A549, respectively), at low micromolar concentrations withN(2)-regioisomers exhibiting higher activity than their correspondingN(1)-isomers. The most active compound incorporates an acetic acid hydrazide moiety at theN(2)of the TBBt triazole nucleus with IC(50)at 0.131 mu M (CK2 alpha), 9.1 mu M (MCF-7) and 6.3 mu M (A549). It induced apoptosis in the MCF-7 cell line through upregulation of bax (pro-apoptotic gene) four to five times higher than the corresponding ester or acid analogues. Molecular docking suggests that the hydrophilic group atN(2)of the TBBt triazole nucleus provides binding with important residues (Asp175, Lys68 and Trp176) in the ATP binding site of the CK2 alpha enzyme. We are the first to experimentally estimate the lipophilicity of TBBt derivatives. Our study demonstrated that TBBt hydrazides are more lipophilic than their corresponding acids in contrast to the contradicting calculated lipophilicity using four well-known software programs. This may explain the higher anticancer activity of the most active hydrazide over its corresponding acid despite their nearly equipotent enzyme inhibition.",,"El-Kardocy, A; Mostafa, YA; Mohamed, NG; Abo-Zeid, MN; Hassan, NA; Hetta, HF; Abdel-Aal, ABM",2020.0,Journal,NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY,10.1039/d0nj01194k,"[El-Kardocy, Ahmed; Mohamed, Noha G.; Abdel-Aal, Abu-Baker M.] Assiut Univ, Student Res Unit, Fac Pharm, Assiut 71526, Egypt; [Mostafa, Yaser A.; Abdel-Aal, Abu-Baker M.] Assiut Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Organ Chem, Assiut 71526, Egypt; [Abo-Zeid, Mohammad Nabil] Assiut Univ, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Analyt Chem, Assiut 71526, Egypt; [Hassan, Nivin A.] Assiut Univ, South Egypt Canc Inst, Canc Biol Dept, Assiut, Egypt; [Hetta, Helal F.] Assiut Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol & Immunol, Assiut, Egypt; [Hetta, Helal F.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Cincinnati, OH USA",ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,English,1144-0546,
WoS,The Definition of Atomic Scale Strain and Its Application in Identifying the Evolution of Microdefects,"The strain tensors are commonly defined by the local deformation of continuum. Unlike displacement, strain is not a physical quantity that can be measured directly, and it is calculated from a definition that relies on the gradient of the continuous displacement field. At the microscale, it is difficult to define the local deformation according to the position of each atom which is obtained from the adjacent discrete time interval, so there is no universally accepted definition of strain tensors of atomic scale so far, and none of the molecular dynamics software can be used to calculate the atomic strain until now. In order to define the atomic scale strain, a method for calculating the deformation both in the atomic scale and the continuum scale is proposed. In the definition, the discrete deformation gradient is proposed to describe the deformation in the atomic scale and the influence weight function of neighborhood atom is introduced. Then the weighted least squares error optimization model is established to seek the optimal coefficients of the weight function and the optimal local deformation gradient of each atom. After that, the advanced multilayer complex genetic algorithm can be used to calculate the atomic strain. Finally, take NiTi alloy as an example, the molecular dynamics evolution model of deformation and failure of NiTi alloy was established. Then the atomic scale strain nephogram at each time was calculated, and the microdefects such as twins were observed by strain nephogram. Compared with the micro-observation experiment of crack tip of NiTi alloy for three-point bending, the rationality of the atomic scale strain definition method established in this study and its application significance in identifying the evolution of microdefects are verified.",atomic scale strain; discrete deformation gradient; weight function; objective function optimization; evolution of microdefect,"Sheng, Y; Jia, B; Wang, RH; Chen, GP",2020.0,Journal,ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA,10.11900/0412.1961.2019.00343,"[Sheng Ying; Jia Bin; Wang Ruheng; Chen Guoping] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Shock & Vibrat Engn Mat & Struct Key Lab Sichuan, Mianyang 621010, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Sheng Ying; Jia Bin; Wang Ruheng; Chen Guoping] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Mianyang 621010, Sichuan, Peoples R China",SCIENCE PRESS,Chinese,0412-1961,

Bolted shear connector with mechanical coupler is presented in this paper. The connector is assembled from mechanical coupler and rebar anchor, embedded in concrete, and steel bolt, used for connecting steel to concrete members. The behaviour and ultimate resistance of bolted connector with mechanical coupler in wide and narrow members were analysed based on push-out tests and FE analyses conducted in Abaqus software, with focus on concrete edge breakout and bolt shear failure modes. The effect of concrete strength, concrete edge distance and diameter and strength of bolts on failure modes and shear resistance was analysed. It was demonstrated that premature failure by breakout of concrete edge occurs when connectors are located 100 mm or closer from the edge in low-strength and normal-strength reinforced concrete. Furthermore, the paper presents a relatively simple model for hand calculation of concrete edge breakout resistance when bolted connectors with mechanical coupler are used. The model is based on the modification of prediction model used for cast-in and post-installed anchors loaded parallel to the edge, by implementing equivalent influence length of connector with variable diameter.

WoS,Cloud service composition using minimal unsatisfiability and genetic algorithm,"The software-as-a-service layer of cloud computing has evolved much interest among the researchers in the academic and industry worlds. It is based on service-oriented architectures and web service (WS) technology, which are used to offer a remotely accessible application. When a single WS is unable to satisfy all the customer's requirements, a WS composition (WSC) method is applied to connect together various available WSs for building distributed application, using discovery, compatibility checking, selection, and deployment steps. This paper has two-fold contributions: The major one is the proposition of a new algorithm based on minimally unsatisfiable subset formal algorithm to compose WSs. This contribution ensures a faster WSC, which is prominent in an online context. The second contribution is the proposition of a new penalty-based genetic algorithm to identify near-optimal solutions whenever an exact one is not identified using our formal algorithm. Indeed, in some cases, many available WSs provide overlapping/identical functionality; in this context, the choice of participated services is given using quality of service.

These two groups of factors were examined in Schiedam, Netherlands via a mixed-methods approach and analyzed using NVIVO and SPSS software. The results suggest that for cities to be mature enough to introduce DPP, there should be an existing good practice of conventional participatory planning where the concept is extensively practiced, as well as a relatively high trust in the community engagement processes and sufficiently high digital technology literacy among the residents. Thus, maturity levels in cities should be assessed and policies should be developed accordingly to ensure a successful transition toward sustainable smart cities, in light of the findings reported in this study.

WoS,Environmental impact evaluation of an iron and steel plant in China: Normalized data and direct/indirect contribution,"In 2018, 88% of the crude steel manufactured in China was produced by blast furnace - basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. This leads to high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in China's iron and steel industry. In this study, the life cycle assessment of environmental impact in an iron and steel plant was evaluated by using GaBi v.8.7 software. Eight assessment categories were evaluated to determine direct/indirect contribution, and the results of impact categories were further normalized for comparison among different unit processes. The results indicated that the BF alone contributed greatly to various environmental impact categories, or 73% Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP), 54% Eutrophication Potential (EP), and 69% Global Warming Potential (GWP). Different scenario settings were established to reduce nonrenewable fuel consumption and corresponding environmental impacts. The scenario 2 (replacement of coke and anthracite in BF with charcoal) and scenario 3 (increasing electric arc furnace (EAF) route) were able to reduce total environmental impacts by 14% and 25%, respectively, as compared to the scenario 1 (existing conditions). The normalized results of each assessment category scores indicated that the main environmental impacts of production process were Human Toxicity Potential (33%), GWP (30%) and ADP (25%). The EAF route exhibits less environmental impact than BF-BOF route, especially in GWP, ADP, Cumulative Energy Demand and EP. In the future, steel making enterprises in China should be encouraged to shift their process from BF-BOF to EAF route as was done in developed countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

WoS,Discovery of the active compounds of Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma by utilizing the relationship between the individual differences in blood drug concentration and the pharmacological effect in rats,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: This study addresses the rapid discovery of the active compounds (the original constituents and/or metabolites) of a traditional Chinese drug, Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma (SGR). Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to develop a new method to find out the active compounds of traditional drugs in vivo. Materials and methods: A method was established to discover and identify the potential active compounds in drug-containing plasma from rats that were orally administered SGR extract, utilizing the relationship between the individual differences in blood drug concentrations in the rats and the resulting differences in pharmacological effect, and the method was denoted as the RID-PE method. For this method, we used high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector combined with electrospray ionization ion trap time-of-flight multistage mass spectrometry (LC-MSn) to identify the compounds (the original constituents and metabolites) and to determine the peak areas of the compounds in drug-containing plasma following SGR treatment. The anti-inflammatory effect of SGR was evaluated using a carrageenan-induced inflammatory rat model. According to the percent inhibition of paw edema in each model rat (14 rats total) orally administered SGR extract, the plasma samples from the rats were sorted and divided into 7 groups. Each group consisted of two plasma samples, and their percent inhibition of paw edema were similar to each other. We performed an LC-MSn analysis on 3 plasma groups, which showed large differences in the inhibition rates, with percent inhibitions of 92.7%, 72.4% and 38.4%. The correlation coefficients (r) between the peak area of each compound and the pharmacological effect (inhibition ratio) of SGR in the three groups were analyzed using SPSS software. When the correlation coefficients of the compounds are greater than 0.8 (0.8 < r <= 1), these compounds are strongly and positively correlated with anti-inflammatory activity, making them potential anti-inflammatory active compounds. Results: Fifty-eight potential anti-inflammatory compounds (0.8 < r <= 1) from SGR were discovered in model rat plasma using the RID-PE method, 47 of which were considered to be new potentially anti-inflammatory compounds. Among these compounds, four original constituents and 5 isomers of potential anti-inflammatory metabolites were validated to have significant anti-inflammatory effects, and they included astilbin, syringic acid, catechin, coumalic acid, resveratrol-3'-O-glucuronide (RG, isomer of M2 or M3), 3'-O-methyl-(+)-epicatechin-4'-O-glucuronide (CA-1, isomer of M16), 4'-O-methyl-(+)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide (CA-2, isomer of M16), 4'-O-methyl-(+)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide (CA-3, isomer of M16) and 3'-O-methyl-(+)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide (CA-4, isomer of M16). In addition, four isomers (CA-1-CA-4) were reported to have anti-inflammatory effects for the first time, and CA-3 was a new compound. Conclusions: The RID-PE method can be used to discover and identify the active constituents and metabolites of SGR systematically and in vivo. Furthermore, these findings enhance our understanding of the metabolism and effective forms of SGR.",Smilax glabra; Anti-inflammatory; Individual differences in blood drug concentration; RID-PE method; LC-MSn,"Gegentana; Xu, F; Li, FC; Zhang, YF; Shen, SJ; Yang, P; Yang, XX; Shang, MY; Liu, GX; Li, YL; XuanWang; Cai, SQ",2020.0,Journal,JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY,10.1016/j.jep.2020.112886,"[Gegentana; Xu, Feng; Li, Feng-Chun; Zhang, Yi-Fan; Shen, Shu-Jie; Yang, Ping; Yang, Xin-Xin; Shang, Ming-Ying; Liu, Guang-Xue; Li, Yao-Li; Cai, Shao-Qing] Peking Univ, State Key Lab Nat & Biomimet Drugs, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [XuanWang] Peking Univ, Dept Chem Biol, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,English,0378-8741,
WoS,Adaptive radiotherapy based on statistical process control for oropharyngeal cancer,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to quantify dosimetric changes throughout the delivery of oropharyngeal cancer treatment and to investigate the application of statistical process control (SPC) for the management of significant deviations during the course of radiotherapy. Methods Thirteen oropharyngeal cancer patients with daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were retrospectively reviewed. Cone beam computed tomography images of every other fraction were imported to the Velocity software and registered to planning CT using the 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) couch shifts generated during patient setup. Using Velocity Adaptive Monitoring module, the setup-corrected CBCT was matched to planning CT using a deformable registration. Volumes and dose metrics at each fraction were calculated and rated with plan values to evaluate interfractional dosimetric variations using a SPC framework.T-tests between plan and fraction volumes were performed to find statistically insignificant fractions. Average upper and lower process capacity limits (UCL, LCL) of each dose metric were derived from these fractions using conventional SPC guidelines. Results Gross tumor volume (GTV) and organ at risk (OAR) volumes in the first 13 fractions had no significant changes from the pretreatment planning CT. The GTV and the parotid glands subsequently decreased by 10% at the completion of treatment. There were 3-4% increases in parotid mean doses, but no significant differences in dose metrics of GTV and other OARs. The changes were organ and patient dependent. Control charts for various dose metrics were generated to assess the metrics at each fraction for individual patient. Conclusions Daily CBCT could be used to monitor dosimetric variations of targets and OARs resulting from volume changes and tissue deformation in oropharyngeal cancer radiotherapy. Treatment review with the guidance of a SPC tool allows for an objective and consistent clinical decision to apply adaptive radiotherapy.",adaptive radiotherapy; head and neck cancer; oropharyngeal cancer; statistical process control,"Wang, HS; Xue, JY; Chen, T; Qu, TX; Barbee, D; Tam, M; Hu, K",2020.0,JournalEA,JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS,10.1002/acm2.12993,"[Wang, Hesheng; Xue, Jinyu; Chen, Ting; Qu, Tanxia; Barbee, David; Tam, Moses; Hu, Kenneth] NYU Langone Hlth, Dept Radiat Oncol, New York, NY 10016 USA",WILEY,English,1526-9914,

WoS,Exosomal lncRNA H19 promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with Propofol via miR-520a-3p/LIMK1 axis,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Herein, we explored the underlying mechanism by which Propofol inhibited the development of HCC. Methods 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was carried out to detect the viability and proliferation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were performed to detect the expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19, microRNA-520a-3p (miR-520a-3p), LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), metastasis-associated markers (Snail, Twist, Vimentin and E-cadherin) and exosome markers (CD9 and CD81). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the morphology and structure of exosomes. The apoptosis and metastasis were measured by flow cytometry and transwell assays. StarBase software was utilized to predict the targets of H19 and miR-520a-3p. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the interaction between miR-520a-3p and H19 or LIMK1. Nude mice bearing tumors were used to validate the role of exosomal H19. RESULTS The high expression of exosomal H19 accelerated the proliferation and motility while hampering the apoptosis of HCC cells. MiR-520a-3p could bind with H19. Exosomal H19 exacerbated HCC through sponging miR-520a-3p. The 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of LIMK1 could bind to miR-520a-3p. MiR-520a-3p mimic transfection reversed the inhibitory effect of high expression of exosomal LIMK1 on the apoptosis of HCC cells and the promoting effects on the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells. The mRNA and protein levels of LIMK1 were regulated by H19/miR-520a-3p signaling. The high level of exosomal H19 promoted the growth of HCC tumors in vivo. Conclusion Circulating H19 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion and inhibited the apoptosis of HCC cells treated with Propofol through upregulating LIMK1 via sponging miR-520a-3p.",exosome; H19; hepatocellular carcinoma; LIMK1; miR-520a-3p,"Wang, DM; Xing, N; Yang, T; Liu, JQ; Zhao, HP; He, J; Ai, YQ; Yang, JJ",2020.0,JournalEA,CANCER MEDICINE,10.1002/cam4.3313,"[Wang, Dongmei; Xing, Na; Zhao, Huaping; He, Juan; Ai, Yanqiu; Yang, Jianjun] Zhengzhou Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Anesthesiol Pain & Perioperat Med, 1 Jianshe East Rd, Zhengzhou 450052, Peoples R China; [Yang, Tao] Zhengzhou Univ, Affiliated Hosp 5, Dept Anesthesiol, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Junqi] Zhengzhou Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Radiotherapy, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",WILEY,English,2045-7634,

Methods Dental digital models from 64 OSAS patients and 64 control subjects were used to obtain dental arch forms and to compare them between the two groups. Arch forms were extracted from the lower arch models using a professional graphics program and an orthodontic digital template. Through an orthodontic software, inter-molar, inter-premolar, and inter-canine widths were measured for both upper and lower arches. Results The dental arch forms distribution differed between OSAS patients and controls. OSAS patients had reduced inter-canine, inter-premolar, and inter-molar widths for both arches compared to controls.

WoS,"Monochromatic red electroluminescence from a homodinuclear europium(III) complex of a beta-diketone tethered by 2,2 '-bipyrimidine","A new homodinuclear complex [Eu(btfa)(3)](2)bpm (1) was synthesized incorporating 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione (btfa) as the primary and 2,20-bipyrimidine (bpm) as the auxiliary ligand. The complex was characterized by analytical and spectroscopic techniques, with special emphasis on the crystal structure and photoluminescence (PL) properties, both experimentally and theoretically. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals that the two Eu(III) ions in 1 are eight coordinate, where the bpm behaves as a N-4 donor linking the two Eu(III) ions symmetrically. Each Eu(III) ion displays a distorted square antiprismatic (DSAP, D-4d) coordination geometry. Complex 1 displayed bright red emission with (CIE)(x,y) color coordinates = 0.670; 0.330 and an absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 54.4%. The theoretical intensity parameters (Omega(2) and Omega(4)), radiative (A(R)) and non-radiative (A(NR)) decay rates, intrinsic quantum yield (Q(Eu)(Eu)), sensitization efficiency (eta(sen)) and PLQY were assessed using the LUMPAC software and showed very good agreement with the experimental values. Based on these, an energy transfer (ET) mechanism is proposed and discussed. Moreover, 1 was used as an emitter to fabricate single- and double-emitting layer (EML) red-emitting electroluminescent devices.

Methods In this cross-sectional study 410 of Postmenopausal Iranian women in Neyshabur are examined. QOL was assessed using MENQOL questionnaire, and social support was assessed through administration of a modified Sarason's Social Support Questionnaire. The data were analyzed through conduction of a Pearson correlation coefficient and Linear regression analysis using SPSS software package 20. Results It was found that the average age of PMW was 53.92 +/- 3.86 years. The total scores of the QOL ranged from 10 to 30, with a mean of 37.83 (SD = 12.9). Mean scores of Sexual, psychological, physical, and Vasomotor domain of QOL were 12.55 +/- 6.96, 14.66 +/- 2.20, 18.11 +/- 1.85, 12.02 +/- 4.93.

WoS,"High-energy ion (He+, Si++, Ga+, Au++) interactions with PMMA in ion beam lithography","Resist-based ion beam lithography has been studied by exposing different species of ions (He+, Si++, Ga(+)and Au++) on 700 and 2000 angstrom thick poly(methyl methacrylate) (or PMMA) films supported on Si substrates. By comparing the resist sensitivities to different ions and the cross-sectional shapes of the developed features with the simulation outputs from the TRIM (TRansport of Ions in Matter) software, long-chain scissoring in PMMA can be largely attributed to ion-initiated electron cascades (as evaluated by ion energy loss to the electrons) and recoil atom cascades (as evaluated by vacancy distribution in TRIM). The ion-initiated electron cascades contribute more to the resist sensitivity for the lighter ions, while the recoil atom cascades are more important for the heavier ions. A proportional relation between the resist sensitivity and the product of the ion energy loss to electrons and vacancy number is obtained semi-empirically for heavy ions. The He(+)ion is the only ion species that can travel through and therefore expose the entire 2000-angstrom thick PMMA resist film, while the heaviest ion, Au++, provides the highest resist sensitivity. The effective energy and momentum impartment to the resist by the ion, as revealed by recoil atom cascades and vacancy formation, is important to significantly expanding the material types suitable for ion beam lithography.",focused ion beam; ion beam lithography; PMMA; transport of ions in matter simulation,"Zhang, L; Thomas, JP; Guan, XY; Heinig, NF; Leung, KT",2020.0,Journal,NANOTECHNOLOGY,10.1088/1361-6528/ab8d69,"[Leung, Kam Tong] Univ Waterloo, WATLab, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; Univ Waterloo, Dept Chem, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",IOP PUBLISHING LTD,English,0957-4484,
WoS,Treatment and toxic effects of prophylactic cranial irradiation in stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer: A meta-analysis,"Objective To determine the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using meta-analysis. Methods PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were systematically searched for studies published between 1 January 1980 and 31 March 2019. Search terms included non-small cell lung cancer, prophylactic cranial irradiation and clinical trials. The research data extracted from above studies was analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 and Stata12.0 software. The outcomes included development of brain metastases (BMs), overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), BMs for different diagnoses, toxicity, quality of life (QoL). Results Fifteen trials (nine RCTs and six non-RCTs) involving 2418 NSCLC patients met the inclusion criteria. There was a significant reduction in the risk of developing BM in patients who received PCI compared with those who did not (95% CI, 0.20-0.37;P < 0.00001). PCI significantly reduced the BM of squamous cell carcinoma (P = 0.02), but not for adenocarcinoma (P = 0.07) and other pathological types (P = 0.29). There was a significant increase in DFS for the PCI compared to the non-PCI group (P = 0.006); however, OS did not significantly differ (P = 0.15). In addition, fatigue significantly increased in the PCI group (P = 0.0002). Cognitive disturbance showed no significant difference between PCI and non-PCI groups (P = 0.06). Conclusion This study showed that, compared with non-PCI, PCI significantly decreased the incidence of NSCLC BM and improved the DFS of patients, and reduced the BM rate from squamous cell carcinoma. However, it showed no effect on OS and the BM rate of adenocarcinoma and other pathological types of tumors.

WoS,Design and hydraulic performance studies on an axiallead-bismuthpump forGEN-IVreactors,"Lead or lead-alloy-cooled fast reactors (LFRs) have been proved to be the most promising generation IV reactors with high performance in neutron economy, thermal hydraulics and security features. When lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) is used as coolant for LFR, the primary LBE pump is a key conveying equipment in LFRs, because it pumps liquid LBE to remove decay heat produced by core. The hydraulic performance and coolant flow velocity of LBE coolant pump is of great importance for the safety aspects concerning LFRs. This study aims to design an axial LBE pump firstly based on the theory of planar cascade and streamline method, then establishes three-dimensional model of the axial LBE pump and performs the simulation analysis based on Ansys CFX software to study the impact of design parameters on LBE pump hydraulic performance. The results show that the highest flow velocity occurs at the blade of pump and it increases with the rotating speed, while the pump efficiency and pump head appear up-down tendency as the flow rate increasing.

Extensive analysis revealed that the shield is able to improve the quality factor (Q-factor) only of the inductor operated at the lowest frequency (ie, K-band). On the contrary, it has a detrimental effect on theQ-factor of the inductors working at higher frequencies. This is mainly due to induced losses in the PGS itself, which are so high to frustrate the substrate loss reduction. This result gives a different perspective to the adoption of the PGS for CMOS integrated inductors, which is largely recommended to improve inductor performance in the current state of the art.",CMOS technology; electromagnetic simulations; equivalent lumped model; integrated inductor; quality factor; PGS,"Spataro, S; Salerno, N; Papotto, G; Ragonese, E",2020.0,JournalEA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RF AND MICROWAVE COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING,10.1002/mmce.22368,"[Spataro, Simone; Salerno, Nunzio; Ragonese, Egidio] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Ingn Elettr Elettron & Informat DIEE, Vle Doria 6, I-95125 Catania, Italy; [Papotto, Giuseppe] STMicroelectronics, Automot Div Grp ADG, R&D Power & Discretes, Catania, Italy",WILEY,English,1096-4290,
WoS,A nonlinear visco-poroelasticity model for transversely isotropic gels,"A polymeric gel contains a crosslinked polymer network and solvent. Gels can swell or shrink in response to external stimuli. Two kinetic processes are usually involved during the deformation of gels: the viscoelastic and poroelastic responses. Viscoelasticity of gels is generated from the local rearrangement of the polymers, while poroelasticity of gels is generated from the solvent migration. The coupled time-dependent behaviors of gels can be formulated by coupling a rheological spring-dashpot model with a diffusion-deformation model of gels. In this work, we build a general framework of coupled visco-poroelasticity for transversely isotropic gels and study how the mechanical anisotropy could induce anisotropic time-dependent behaviors of gels even though their kinetic properties are isotropic. The constitutive model is implemented into a finite element code in commercial software. Several numerical simulations are performed to investigate the time-dependent deformation and frequency-dependent energy dissipation under different loading directions. The results show that even though the viscoelasticity and the poroelasticity are isotropic, the time-dependent behaviors along different directions are different due to the mechanical anisotropy. The fibers aligned in the transversely isotropic gel enhance the elastic feature of the material, and thus influence the dissipation time scales and the amount of energy loss for both viscoelasticity and poroelasticity.",Gel; Viscoelasticity; Poroelasticity; Transverse isotropy,"He, DJ; Hu, YH",2020.0,JournalEA,MECCANICA,10.1007/s11012-020-01219-w,"[He, Dongjing; Hu, Yuhang] Georgia Inst Technol, George W Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, 801 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Hu, Yuhang] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, 311 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",SPRINGER,English,0025-6455,
WoS,"Evaluation of the effect ofSilybum marianumextract on menopausal symptoms: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial","The tendency to use herbs to manage menopausal symptoms has increased in recent years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect ofSilybum marianum(L.) compared with placebo in women with hot flashes. Eighty women were randomly allocated into two equal groups (S. marianumextract [400 mg/d] or placebo capsules). Hot flashes frequency and severity were evaluated in 12 weeks with the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) and the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS). The data were analyzed in SPSS software usingt-test, Mann-Whitney, chi-square test and repeated measure analysis. Hot flashes frequency and severity decreased from 4.32 +/- 0.20/day to 1.31 +/- 0.15/day and from 5.25 +/- 0.22 to 1.62 +/- 0.08, respectively, during the study in test group (p< .001) which were significantly better than effects of placebo in all steps of study (p< .001). Significant decreases in GCS and HFRDIS scores were also detected inS. marianumgroup compared with placebo after 4, 8 and 12 weeks (p< .001). The results showed thatS. marianumcan decrease frequency and severity of hot flashes significantly. Considering the safety and high consumption of this herbal medicine worldwide, its use in women with menopausal symptoms can be helpful.",herbal medicine; hot flashes; menopause; Milk thistle; Silybum marianum,"Saberi, Z; Gorji, N; Memariani, Z; Moeini, R; Shirafkan, H; Amiri, M",2020.0,JournalEA,PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH,10.1002/ptr.6789,"[Saberi, Zohreh] Babol Univ Med Sci, Sch Persian Med, Dept Persian Med, Babol Sar, Iran; [Gorji, Narjes; Memariani, Zahra; Moeini, Reihaneh] Babol Univ Med Sci, Hlth Res Inst, Tradit Med & Hist Med Sci Res Ctr, Babol Sar, Iran; [Shirafkan, Hoda] Babol Univ Med Sci, Hlth Res Inst, Babol Sar, Iran; [Amiri, Mania] Babol Univ Med Sci, Infertil & Reprod Hlth Res Ctr, Hlth Res Inst & Clin Res, PCOs Clin, Babol Sar, Iran",WILEY,English,0951-418X,
WoS,Theoretical study of excitation energy transfer and nonlinear spectroscopy of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes using the nonperturbative reduced dynamics method,"The highly efficient excitation energy transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes have attracted much recent research interests. Experimentally, spectroscopic studies have provided important information on the energetics and EET dynamics. Theoretically, due to the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex interaction between the pigments and the protein environment, it is impossible to simulate the whole system quantum mechanically. Effective Hamiltonian models are often used, in which the most important degrees of freedom are treated explicitly and all the other degrees of freedom are treated as a thermal bath. However, even with such simplifications, solving the real-time quantum dynamics could still be a difficult task. A particular challenging case in simulating the EET dynamics and related spectroscopic phenomena lies in the so-called intermediate coupling regime, where the intermolecular electronic couplings and the electronic-vibrational couplings are of similar strength. In this article, we review theoretical studies of linear and nonlinear spectroscopic signals of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, using the nonperturbative hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach. Simulations were performed for the EET dynamics, various types of linear spectra, two-dimensional electronic spectra, and pump-probe spectra. Benchmark tests of several approximate methods related to the HEOM approach were also discussed. The results show that the nonperturbative HEOM approach is an effective method in simulating the EET dynamics and spectroscopic signals of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. Important insights into EET pathways, quantum effects including quantum delocalization, and quantum coherence in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes were also obtained through such simulations.

WoS,Fault Ride-Through Capability with Mutual Inductance in Low-Voltage Single-Phase Microgrid,"Improving the microgrid fault ride-through capability and enhancing the transient performance of microgrid operation due to voltage sags is of great importance. This paper investigates the ride-through capability and feasibility of integrating a mutual inductance between the main grid and the microgrid under short circuit condition. The fault ride-through capability of the microgrid DGs is examined by placing the mutual inductance at PCC to suppress the fault current and to maintain the microgrid grid connected. This inductance requires no control to operate in which the sudden current increase is the key point of its operation. The microgrid DGs can operate successfully in grid-connected mode without reactive power support during the voltage sag duration. The effectiveness of the inserted mutual inductance has been validated considering two case scenarios of the microgrid power flow condition. The proposed methodology shows promising results, in which it confirms the applicability of the mutual inductance in riding through the fault current and maintaining the microgrid DG operation in the grid-connected mode. SimPowerSystems and PLECS toolboxes of Matlab/Simulink software are utilized to implement the proposed work.",Fault ride-through capability; mutual inductance; short circuit; single-phase microgrid,"Salem, Q; Alzaareer, K",2020.0,JournalEA,IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH,10.1080/03772063.2020.1800524,"[Salem, Qusay] Ulm Univ, Inst Energy Convers & Storage, Ulm, Germany; [Alzaareer, Khaled] Quebec Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,English,0377-2063,
WoS,Use of Skeletal Muscle Index as a Predictor of Wait-List Mortality in Patients With End-Stage Liver Disease,"The aim of this study is to validate a proposed definition of sarcopenia in predicting wait-list mortality. We retrospectively evaluated 355 adults (age >= 18 years) with cirrhosis listed for first-time LT from January 1, 2010, to April 1, 2018 from our center. Demographic, laboratory, and outcome data were collected in conjunction with computed tomography scans performed within 3 months of listing. Using imaging analysis software, the skeletal muscle index (SMI), which is a marker for sarcopenia-related mortality, was calculated. A survival analysis was performed to evaluate the association of the proposed sarcopenia definition of SMI <50 cm(2)/m(2)for men or <39 cm(2)/m(2)for women with wait-list mortality or delisting. Median SMI was 54.1 cm(2)/m(2)(range, 47-60 cm(2)/m(2)). A total of 61 (17.2%) patients exhibited sarcopenia according to the proposed threshold, and 24.6% (57/232) of men were sarcopenic compared with 3.3% (4/123) of women (P < 0.001). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) SMI was also higher for men (56.6 +/- 9.6 cm(2)/m(2)) than for women (50.7 +/- 8.0 cm(2)/m(2);P < 0.001). Median follow-up time among patients was 2.1 months (0-12 months), and 30 events were observed (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.02;P = 0.41). There was no statistically significant difference in time on the waiting list between patients with and without sarcopenia (P = 0.89) as defined at the threshold. Using the prespecified definitions of sarcopenia based on SMI, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality and delisting from the transplant waiting list between patients with and without sarcopenia in this population. Practice and region-specific patterns for pretransplant selection and median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease at transplant may affect SMI as a predictor of wait-list mortality.",,"Kappus, MR; Wegermann, K; Bozdogan, E; Patel, YA; Janas, G; Shropshire, E; Parish, A; Niedzwiecki, D; Muir, AJ; Bashir, M",2020.0,JournalEA,LIVER TRANSPLANTATION,10.1002/lt.25802,"[Kappus, Matthew R.; Wegermann, Kara; Patel, Yuval A.; Muir, Andrew J.; Bashir, Mustafa] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Bozdogan, Erol; Janas, Gemini; Shropshire, Erin; Bashir, Mustafa] Duke Univ, Dept Radiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Parish, Alice; Niedzwiecki, Donna] Duke Univ, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Muir, Andrew J.] Duke Univ, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Bashir, Mustafa] Duke Univ, Duke Ctr Adv Magnet Resonance Dev, Durham, NC 27710 USA",WILEY,English,1527-6465,
WoS,Multiple Gene Expression Dataset Analysis Reveals Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathway is Strongly Associated With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Pathogenesis,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a complex pulmonary disease that causes airflow obstruction in humans. To identify the core genes in COPD pathogenesis, seven diverse microarray datasets (GSE475, GSE1122, GSE1650, GSE3212, GSE8823, GSE37768, and GSE22148) were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database. All the datasets were analyzed independently with the R/Bioconductor package to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis were performed for the acquired DEGs using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery). Further protein-protein interaction network was constructed for the DEGs and their potential hub genes and sub-networks were identified using Cytoscape software. From the selected seven datasets, 188 overlapped DEGs were perceived eventually based on considering the repetitive genes between at-least one dataset. Gene Ontology analysis reveals that most of the DEGs were significantly enriched in immune response, inflammatory response, extracellular region, lipid binding, cytokine, and chemokine activity. Moreover, genes from the sub-network analysis were again submitted to the DAVID server to validate the results which uncover the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway was significantly enriched and all the genes present in this pathway were likewise detected as hub genes from Cytoscape software. CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL4, TLR7, and SPP1 hub genes in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway were explored in this study as potential biomarker genes associated with COPD pathogenesis.",Toll-like receptor; differentially expressed genes; chemokine receptors; secreted phosphoprotein 1,"Dhamodharan, P; Arumugam, M",2020.0,JournalEA,COPD-JOURNAL OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE,10.1080/15412555.2020.1793314,"[Dhamodharan, Pavithra; Arumugam, Mohanapriya] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Biosci & Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India",TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,English,1541-2555,
