SD,Influence of multiple hypothesis testing on reproducibility in neuroimaging research: A simulation study and Python-based software,"Background Reproducibility of research findings has been recently questioned in many fields of science, including psychology and neurosciences. One factor influencing reproducibility is the simultaneous testing of multiple hypotheses, which entails false positive findings unless the analyzed p-values are carefully corrected. While this multiple testing problem is well known and studied, it continues to be both a theoretical and practical problem. New method Here we assess reproducibility in simulated experiments in the context of multiple testing. We consider methods that control either the family-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR), including techniques based on random field theory (RFT), cluster-mass based permutation testing, and adaptive FDR. Several classical methods are also considered. The performance of these methods is investigated under two different models. Results We found that permutation testing is the most powerful method among the considered approaches to multiple testing, and that grouping hypotheses based on prior knowledge can improve power. We also found that emphasizing primary and follow-up studies equally produced most reproducible outcomes. Comparison with existing method(s) We have extended the use of two-group and separate-classes models for analyzing reproducibility and provide a new open-source software “MultiPy” for multiple hypothesis testing. Conclusions Our simulations suggest that performing strict corrections for multiple testing is not sufficient to improve reproducibility of neuroimaging experiments. The methods are freely available as a Python toolkit “MultiPy” and we aim this study to help in improving statistical data analysis practices and to assist in conducting power and reproducibility analyses for new experiments.",False discovery rate; Family-wise error rate; Multiple hypothesis testing; Neurophysiological data; Python; Reproducibility,"Puoliväli, Tuomas; Palva, Satu; Palva, J.

SD,Python BMDS: A Python interface library and web application for the canonical EPA dose-response modeling software,"Several primary sources of publicly available, quantitative dose-response data from traditional toxicology study designs relevant to predictive toxicology applications are now available, including the redeveloped U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxicity Reference Database (ToxRefDB v2.0), the Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC), and the National Toxicology Program’s Chemical Program’s Chemical Effects in Biological Systems (CEBS). These resources provide effect level information but modeling these data to a curve may be more informative for predictive toxicology applications. Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS) has been recognized broadly and used for regulatory applications at multiple agencies. However, the current BMDS software was not amenable to modeling large datasets. Herein we describe development and use of a Python package that implements a wrapper around BMDS, a software that requires manual input in the dose-response modeling process (i.e., best-fitting model-selection, reporting, and dose-dropping). In the Python BMDS, users can select the BMDS version, customize model recommendation logic, and export summaries of the resultant BMDS output. Further, using the Python interface, a web-based application programming interface (API) has been developed for easy integration into other software systems, pipelines, or databases. Software utility was demonstrated via modeling nearly 28,000 datasets in ToxRefDB v2.0, re-creation of an existing, published large-scale analysis, and demonstration of usage in software such as CEBS and HAWC. Python BMDS enables rapid-batch processing of dose-response datasets using a modeling software with broad acceptance in the toxicology community, thereby providing an important tool for leveraging the publicly available quantitative toxicology data in a reproducible manner.",Benchmark dose modeling; Dose-Response; Software; Systematic review; toxicology,"Pham, Ly Ly; Watford, Sean; Friedman, Katie Paul; Wignall, Jessica; Shapiro, Andrew J.",2019,Journal,Reproductive Toxicology,10.1016/j.reprotox.2019.07.013,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890623819300875,,English,0890-6238,
SD,TaxisPy: A Python-based software for the quantitative analysis of bacterial chemotaxis,"Several species of bacteria are able to modify their swimming behavior in response to chemical attractants or repellents. Methods for the quantitative analysis of bacterial chemotaxis such as quantitative capillary assays are tedious and time-consuming. Computer-based video analysis of swimming bacteria represents a valuable method to directly assess their chemotactic response. Even though multiple studies have used this approach to elucidate various aspects of bacterial chemotaxis, to date, no computer software for such analyses is freely available. Here, we introduce TaxisPy, a Python-based software for the quantitative analysis of bacterial chemotaxis. The software comes with an intuitive graphical user interface and can be accessed easily through Docker on any operating system. Using a video of freely swimming cells as input, TaxisPy estimates the culture's average tumbling frequency over time. We demonstrate the utility of the software by assessing the effect of different concentrations of the attractant shikimate on the swimming behavior of Pseudomonas putida F1 and by capturing the adaptation process that Escherichia coli undergoes after being exposed to l-aspartate.",Cell tracking software; Quantitative chemotaxis; Video analysis software,"Valderrama-Gómez, Miguel Á.; Schomer, Rebecca A.; Savageau, Michael A.; Parales, Rebecca E.",2020,Journal,Journal of Microbiological Methods,10.1016/j.mimet.2020.105918,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701220300865,,English,0167-7012,
SD,Understanding metric-based detectable smells in Python software: A comparative study,"Context Code smells are supposed to cause potential comprehension and maintenance problems in software development. Although code smells are studied in many languages, e.g. Java and C#, there is a lack of technique or tool support addressing code smells in Python. Objective Due to the great differences between Python and static languages, the goal of this study is to define and detect code smells in Python programs and to explore the effects of Python smells on software maintainability. Method In this paper, we introduced ten code smells and established a metric-based detection method with three different filtering strategies to specify metric thresholds (Experience-Based Strategy, Statistics-Based Strategy, and Tuning Machine Strategy). Then, we performed a comparative study to investigate how three detection strategies perform in detecting Python smells and how these smells affect software maintainability with different detection strategies. This study utilized a corpus of 106 Python projects with most stars on GitHub. Results The results showed that: (1) the metric-based detection approach performs well in detecting Python smells and Tuning Machine Strategy achieves the best accuracy; (2) the three detection strategies discover some different smell occurrences, and Long Parameter List and Long Method are more prevalent than other smells; (3) several kinds of code smells are more significantly related to changes or faults in Python modules. Conclusion These findings reveal the key features of Python smells and also provide a guideline for the choice of detection strategy in detecting and analyzing Python smells.",Code smell; Detection strategy; Python; Software maintainability,"Chen, Zhifei; Chen, Lin; Ma, Wanwangying; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Yuming; Xu, Baowen",2018,Journal,Information and Software Technology,10.1016/j.infsof.2017.09.011,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584916301690,,English,0950-5849,
SD,Open-source Python software for analysis of 3D kinematics from quadrupedal animals,"Locomotion is key to survival, yet it can be disturbed by injuries, diseases, and aging. Therefore, it is important for researchers in biology, neuroscience, biomechanics, and further afield. Locomotion is frequently quantified using kinematic data, and quadrupeds including rodents are medical model animals used worldwide. Kinematics typically result from the tracking of some landmarks, often joint centers. Although commercially available systems and software exist for the analysis of these kinematic data, they are expensive, often restricted to use with a given apparatus, and may be inextensible. Therefore, there is a need for an open source tool to analyze kinematic data. We present a Python software to address this need. It uses 2D coordinates from four cameras and DLT coefficients from the calibrated volume to generates 3D coordinates [1]. A method is presented to modify the knee and elbow joint positions in 3D. Then, kinematic features are extracted, and they are sorted in a time series format to plot a summary of a study. In addition, we generate videos from the tracked points, 3D reconstruction of the points, showing joint angles for eight joints, the location of animal on the belt, and the animal's speed on the belt. The software has been evaluated by eight trials to show the importance of the work. The 3D reconstruction error, having an average of 7.36 pixels, was calculated for the markers. The presented program can be used in different fields. It will encourage the researchers to design the studies based on their needs because they can change the setup in any required conditions while they can extract the kinematic data.",3D Reconstruction; Biology; Biomechanics; Kinematics; Neuroscience; Python,"Maghsoudi, Omid Haji; Vahedipour, Annie; Hallowell, Thomas; Spence, Andrew",2019,Journal,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,10.1016/j.bspc.2019.02.024,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809419300692,,English,1746-8094,

Currently, there has been some online word cloud generators available for users with simple requests, such as repeating the exact phrase, or collecting the text data from a web page. Moreover, most current word cloud generators cannot support characters other than English, which are limited in English-speaking users. There are also packages for programming languages (such as Python and R) to generate word clouds, which requires coding and is not user-friendly. This paper is focusing on developing a graphical user interface (GUI) software to generate word cloud maps with easy operations. The Python programming language is involved and some details are discussed. Finally the software is released for further application.",GUI software; Python; Word cloud,"Jin, Yuping",2017,Journal,Procedia Engineering,10.1016/j.proeng.2017.01.223,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705817302230,,English,1877-7058,

SD,NeuroPycon: An open-source python toolbox for fast multi-modal and reproducible brain connectivity pipelines,"Recent years have witnessed a massive push towards reproducible research in neuroscience. Unfortunately, this endeavor is often challenged by the large diversity of tools used, project-specific custom code and the difficulty to track all user-defined parameters. NeuroPycon is an open-source multi-modal brain data analysis toolkit which provides Python-based template pipelines for advanced multi-processing of MEG, EEG, functional and anatomical MRI data, with a focus on connectivity and graph theoretical analyses. Importantly, it provides shareable parameter files to facilitate replication of all analysis steps. NeuroPycon is based on the NiPype framework which facilitates data analyses by wrapping many commonly-used neuroimaging software tools into a common Python environment. In other words, rather than being a brain imaging software with is own implementation of standard algorithms for brain signal processing, NeuroPycon seamlessly integrates existing packages (coded in python, Matlab or other languages) into a unified python framework. Importantly, thanks to the multi-threaded processing and computational efficiency afforded by NiPype, NeuroPycon provides an easy option for fast parallel processing, which critical when handling large sets of multi-dimensional brain data. Moreover, its flexible design allows users to easily configure analysis pipelines by connecting distinct nodes to each other. Each node can be a Python-wrapped module, a user-defined function or a well-established tool (e.g. MNE-Python for MEG analysis, Radatools for graph theoretical metrics, etc.). Last but not least, the ability to use NeuroPycon parameter files to fully describe any pipeline is an important feature for reproducibility, as they can be shared and used for easy replication by others. The current implementation of NeuroPycon contains two complementary packages: The first, called ephypype, includes pipelines for electrophysiology analysis and a command-line interface for on the fly pipeline creation. Current implementations allow for MEG/EEG data import, pre-processing and cleaning by automatic removal of ocular and cardiac artefacts, in addition to sensor or source-level connectivity analyses. The second package, called graphpype, is designed to investigate functional connectivity via a wide range of graph-theoretical metrics, including modular partitions. The present article describes the philosophy, architecture, and functionalities of the toolkit and provides illustrative examples through interactive notebooks. NeuroPycon is available for download via github (https://github.com/neuropycon) and the two principal packages are documented online (https://neuropycon.github.io/ephypype/index.html, and https://neuropycon.github.io/graphpype/index.html). Future developments include fusion of multi-modal data (eg. MEG and fMRI or intracranial EEG and fMRI). We hope that the release of NeuroPycon will attract many users and new contributors, and facilitate the efforts of our community towards open source tool sharing and development, as well as scientific reproducibility.",Brain imaging; Brain networks; Electroencephalography (EEG); Electrophysiology; Functional connectivity; Graph theory; Magnetoencephalography (MEG); MNE; MRI; Multi-modality; Nipype; Pipelines; Python; Reproducible science; Source reconstruction,"Meunier, David; Pascarella, Annalisa; Altukhov, Dmitrii; Jas, Mainak; Combrisson, Etienne; Lajnef, Tarek; Bertrand-Dubois, Daphné; Hadid, Vanessa; Alamian, Golnoush; Alves, Jordan; Barlaam, Fanny; Saive, Anne-Lise; Dehgan, Arthur; Jerbi, Karim",2020,Journal,NeuroImage,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117020,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920305061,,English,1053-8119,
SD,Applied ichnology in sedimentary geology: Python scripts as a method to automatize ichnofabric analysis in marine core images,"Image analysis has been succesfully applied in core research, especially in studies from modern deposits, to enhance the visibility of ichnological features and characterize ichnoassemblages and ichnofabrics. Its application to ichnological research provides useful information for marine core studies, hence sedimentary geology, but also for hydrocarbon exploration. Here we develop a new methodology, using Python programming language, which significantly improve the ichnological analysis. The method automatizes the process of obtaining continuous ichnological information, in this case about the percentage of bioturbation as a key aspect of the ichnofabric approach. The method affords the possibility of automatically generating continuous percentage and other index records using pixel counts in previously treated images. The resulting data sets are easy to correlate with the information usually obtained from cores (e.g., geochemical and mineralogical data). Such an integration of different proxies for to the field of sedimentary geology especially in the use of ichnological analysis, making it easier for the researcher, less time consuming, and more likely to be undertaken. The coding and sharing of open software tools allow for great flexibility, giving researchers in ichnology or related fields the option to implement new features, develop more complex tools to improve the package, and share findings with the scientific community.",Ichnology; Image analysis; Palaeoenvironment; Python,"Casanova-Arenillas, S.; Rodríguez-Tovar, F.

SD,GPUPeP: Parallel Enzymatic Numerical P System simulator with a Python-based interface,"Membrane computing is a computational paradigm inspired by the structure and behavior of a living cell. P Systems are the computing devices that are used to realize membrane computing models. Numerous theoretical studies on many variants of P Systems have shown them to be computationally universal. There is a wide range of applications of P Systems from modeling of biological processes to image processing. Among many variants of P Systems, one of the most important is Enzymatic Numerical P System (ENPS). ENPS is a class of P System in which membranes operate on numerical values. To realize the power of ENPS there are a few simulators developed. Each and every simulator has some advantages as well as some disadvantages. Here, a GPU based simulator using Python as a user interaction language is developed. This tool is a completely parallel variant, compatible with a Python based sequential simulator (PeP) which was the first Python based work for ENPS. The developed simulator uses CUDA to interact with GPU and gives the desired speed up, while processing the membranes.

Building upon our experiences with the well-known jMetal framework, we have developed a new multi-objective optimization software platform aiming not only at replicating the former one in a different programming language, but also at taking advantage of the full feature set of Python, including its facilities for fast prototyping and the large amount of available libraries for data processing, data analysis, data visualization, and high-performance computing. As a result, jMetalPy provides an environment for solving multi-objective optimization problems focused not only on traditional metaheuristics, but also on techniques supporting preference articulation, constrained and dynamic problems, along with a rich set of features related to the automatic generation of statistical data from the results generated, as well as the real-time and interactive visualization of the Pareto front approximations produced by the algorithms. jMetalPy offers additionally support for parallel computing in multicore and cluster systems.

SD,Design of Radial Turbine Parametric Modeller for Turbocharger using Python,"The time taken for CAD modelling a single component and then building the family of that component consumes a lot of time and is a rigorous task. This problem can be solved by applying parametrisation to the component and make it adapt to changes in the design inputs. The Thermodynamically valid model is based on set of numerical relations. This type of approach requires real experimental data to be legitimate. This method of applying experimental data and back-end usage of thermodynamics equations allows us to create a valid model for industrial usage. This is the objective behind designing of turbocharger turbine parametric modeller. The modeller not only gives direct control of the blade geometry but also provides valuable feedback of the design. This has allowed the user to construct a good initial design before refining it with more computationally expensive methods. The modeller is developed using the python API within the framework of the open source software FreeCAD. The approach to construct a variety of turbo machinery turbines is based partially on state-of-art parametrisation techniques and uses fundamental design variables such as Specific speed, Flow Coefficient and Fluid inlet conditions.

This remark is also valid for deeper cracks because in most experiments it is possible to acquire short signals, which ensure a coarse frequency resolution. Therefore, the accurate estimation of frequency by standard methods is impossible. To improve frequency readability, we designed an algorithm that we implemented in the PyFEST application, written in Python programming language. It allows a fast and accurate calculation of harmonic components of a signal. PyFEST is based on an original signal post-processing algorithm, which consists of overlapping spectra for the signal iteratively cropped. The different signal lengths ensure different positions of the spectral lines in the overlapped spectrum. Therefore, adding numerous spectral lines of different positions in the overlapped spectrum we obtain a dense spectrum with significantly increased frequency resolution. From this spectrum, we select the three magnitudes of the individual spectra found in the frequency range of interest. By interpolation, we attain the maximum that has usually an inter-line position representing the estimated frequency. To this frequency, we apply a correction term that is known a priori and so we improve the frequency estimation. To test the reliability of PyFEST, we provide examples for signals generated with known frequencies that have one or more harmonic components. For signals containing one harmonic component the exact frequency was found, while for signals with multiple components the error are less than 0.1%. The frequency change is exactly estimated for both types of signals. Because PyFEST allows observing minor frequency changes, so we succeed to localize the crack position and severity in real beams with high precision.",Algorithm; Damage detection; Discrete Fourier Transform; Frequency estimation; Python language,"Nedelcu, Dorian; Gillich, Gilbert-Rainer",2021,Journal,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing,10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107087,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327020304738,,English,0888-3270,

SD,Automated Planning and Optimization of a Draping Processes Within the CATIA Environment Using a Python Software Tool,"This thesis deals with the challenge of the virtual generation and optimization of complex production processes within the Computer Aided Design (CAD) environment CATIA V5. A flexible robot end-effector –(Modular Gripper) is used for automated draping process which serves as an example application. Previous experiments have shown that manually selecting all process parameters that are needed to adapt the grippers geometry is a very time consuming and inaccurate method. For this reason, a tool was developed that is able to determine or optimize the end-effector specific process parameters offline. Since all existing models are available in the CATIA environment, the goal was to perform this optimization process within the same environment. The software tool is based on a hierarchical architecture where all calculations and logic optimization processes are processed in the programming language Python. All commands in the CATIA environment are performed with the help of small, modularized CATScript programs that are able to interact with main Python algorithms. This work is intended to lead to a virtual optimization process that can be universally applied to complex manufacturing processes.

In a previous investigation, the effects of disturbing oscillations in a two-stage evaporator system were quantified. In the current study, these oscillations were reduced through trajectory optimization using steam consumption as a temporally discretized decision variable, taking advantage of a dynamic process flowsheet model in Aspen Plus Dynamics (APD) employed as if it were a black-box model. The optimization was performed utilizing a Python-APD toolchain with the SciPy implementation of COBYLA. The optimal trajectory was able to successfully reduce the objective function value (including the product stream mass flow variance and a bang-bang penalty on the trajectory itself) to slightly less than 0.3 % of that of the nominal case, in which a time-invariant steam consumption was employed.

However, many real-application, large-scale operators do not lend themselves to explicit matrix representations, usually forcing practitioners to forego the convenient linear-algebra syntax available for their explicit-matrix counterparts. PyLops is an open-source Python library providing a flexible framework for the creation and combination of so-called linear operators, class-based entities that represent matrices and inherit their associated syntax convenience, but do not rely on the creation of explicit matrices. We show that PyLops operators can dramatically reduce the memory load and CPU computations compared to explicit-matrix calculations, while still allowing users to seamlessly use their existing knowledge of compact matrix-based syntax that scales to any problem size because no explicit matrices are required.",Inverse problems; Linear algebra; Linear operator; Optimization; Python,"Ravasi, Matteo; Vasconcelos, Ivan",2020,Journal,SoftwareX,10.1016/j.softx.2019.100361,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711019301086,,English,2352-7110,

SD,Determination of an inflection point for a dosimetric analysis of unflattened beam using the first principle of derivatives by python code programming,"Background Practice of Unflattened or Flattening filter free (FFF) beam has become the high dose standard in radiotherapy (RT), such as stereotactic radio-surgery (SRS) and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). The removal of a flattening filter (FF) from the path of a photon beam alters the characteristics of FFF beam. Since the conventional route for dosimetric analysis of FF beam cannot be applied to FFF beam, the procedure of analyzing beam characteristics for FFF beam based on inflection points (IPs) is used. IP is a point where the concavity change observed corresponds to its change in sign (±) of the second derivative. Aim The objective of the study is to determine IPs for dosimetric analysis of the FFF beam profile. Methods and materials In this study, IPs are determined through the python code programming based on the mathematical first principle of the derivative. They are compared with IPs estimated by the conventional graphical manual method using Microsoft Excel (MS). IPs and their dependent dosimetric parameters determined by both mathematical and graphical manual methods are compared. Result Percentage differences between the IPs determined by both methods, for 6MVFFF inline and crossline beam profile are found to be 2.7% and 0.8% respectively. Similarly, the average penumbra differences for 6MVFFF inline and crossline beam profile are found to be 0.15mm and 0.9mm, respectively. However, differences in the field width between both methods are found insignificant. Conclusion Graphical manual method is very time-consuming, tedious and user dependent.

SD,Fear-based aggression and its relationship to corticosterone responsiveness in three species of python,"It has long been known that even closely related species can vary in their antipredator behavior, and in the last two decades there has been mounting interest in how these differences might relate to the hormonal stress response. We tested the relationship between fear-based aggression, a form of antipredator behavior, and plasma corticosterone levels in three species of python [Children’s Python (Antaresia childreni), Ball Python (Python regius), Bismarck Ring Python (Bothrochilus boa)]. We recorded the amount of striking in response to perturbation before and after a controlled, stressful confinement. We also measured plasma corticosterone levels prior to confinement, after confinement, and after confinement plus an adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) injection, the later to induce a maximal corticosterone response. We performed among species analyses using two mixed models, and we determined between individual variance within each species to estimate repeatability. Bismarck Ring Pythons struck more than either Ball Pythons or Children’s Pythons, and Ball Pythons had a suppressed corticosterone response compared to Children’s and Bismarck Ring Pythons. Thus, mean species fear-based aggression correlated with species level differences in corticosterone profile. We also found evidence suggesting behaviors are repeatable within individuals.

SD,Effects of feeding and digestion on myocardial contractility and expression of calcium-handling proteins in Burmese pythons (Python molurus),"Pythons are important models of studies on postprandial metabolism because their physiological responses are exacerbated when digesting large prey. Prior studies of these animals have shown hypertrophy of the cardiac tissue 2 to 3 days after feeding, coinciding with the peak of the specific dynamic action (SDA), but the consequences of this remodeling in myocardial contractility have not been studied, which is the purpose of this work. Specimens of Python molurus were divided into two groups: a Digesting group (2 days after feeding, at the peak of SDA), and a Fasting group (28 days after feeding). When compared to the Fasting group, the Digesting group showed higher relative ventricular mass and calcium-handling protein expression such as sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), phospholamban (PLB), and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). Digesting pythons also exhibited significant increases in the cardiac contraction force (Fc), rates of force development and relaxation, and cardiac pumping capacity. Therefore, the higher SERCA, PLB and NCX expression levels increased cytosolic Ca2+ transient amplitude, improving myofilament force. These changes are crucial to maintain cardiac output and a relatively high and continuous blood flow required by metabolic expenditure that occurs in postprandial animals.",Cardiac function; NCX; PLB; SERCA; Snake; Specific dynamic action,"da Silva Vasconcelos, Eliton; Kalinin, Ana Lúcia; Cipriano, Rafael Correa; dos Santos Beserra, Samuel; Lopes, André Guelli; da Costa Leite, Cléo Alcântara; Monteiro, Diana Amaral",2020,Journal,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part B: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,10.1016/j.cbpb.2019.110371,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096495919303306,,English,1096-4959,
SD,Conditional density estimation tools in python and R with applications to photometric redshifts and likelihood-free cosmological inference,"It is well known in astronomy that propagating non-Gaussian prediction uncertainty in photometric redshift estimates is key to reducing bias in downstream cosmological analyses. Similarly, likelihood-free inference approaches, which are beginning to emerge as a tool for cosmological analysis, require a characterization of the full uncertainty landscape of the parameters of interest given observed data. However, most machine learning (ML) or training-based methods with open-source software target point prediction or classification, and hence fall short in quantifying uncertainty in complex regression and parameter inference settings such as the applications mentioned above. As an alternative to methods that focus on predicting the response (or parameters) y from features x, we provide nonparametric conditional density estimation (CDE) tools for approximating and validating the entire probability density function (PDF) p(y|x) of y given (i.e., conditional on) x. This density approach offers a more nuanced accounting of uncertainty in situations with, e.g., nonstandard error distributions and multimodal or heteroskedastic response variables that are often present in astronomical data sets. As there is no one-size-fits-all CDE method, and the ultimate choice of model depends on the application and the training sample size, the goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive range of statistical tools and open-source software for nonparametric CDE and method assessment which can accommodate different types of settings – involving, e.g., mixed-type input from multiple sources, functional data, and images – and which in addition can easily be fit to the problem at hand. Specifically, we introduce four CDE software packages in Python and R based on ML prediction methods adapted and optimized for CDE: NNKCDE, RFCDE, FlexCode, and DeepCDE. Furthermore, we present the cdetools package with evaluation metrics. This package includes functions for computing a CDE loss function for tuning and assessing the quality of individual PDFs, together with diagnostic functions that probe the population-level performance of the PDFs. We provide sample code in Python and R as well as examples of applications to photometric redshift estimation and likelihood-free cosmological inference via CDE.",Cosmology: Cosmological parameters; Galaxies: Distances and redshifts; Methods: Data analysis; Nonparametric statistics; Statistical computing; Statistical software,"Dalmasso, N.; Pospisil, T.; Lee, A.

SD,"Sun-basking, a necessity not a leisure: Anthropogenic driven disturbance, changing the basking pattern of the vulnerable Indian rock python in Keoladeo National Park, India","‘Basking’ is the most conspicuous thermoregulatory behavior in many animals that enable them to enhance physiological performance. Several terrestrial poikilothermic ectotherms have adapted to thermoregulate through basking and seek refuge in subterranean burrows in extreme climatic conditions. Particularly in reptiles, selecting appropriate activity times and postural adjustments are critical thermoregulatory mechanisms and have been recognized as a significant element in the process of behavioral thermoregulation. The present study aims to understand the behavioral adaptation, burrow use regime, and basking pattern of the Indian rock python Python molurus in Keoladeo National Park which witnesses annual weather extremes. Further, the study also investigates the effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the behavioral repertoires of the species, including the changes occurring in the pattern of emergence and retreat into the burrow and basking periods of pythons. The estimated minimum population size of python in KNP was 80 ± 10SD individuals. During the active months of November to April, a general pattern of python activity was observed wherein pythons emerged at 09h00 to 10h00, with a peak in mean basking time of 49.3 ± 18.4SD min per day during 12h00 to 13h00 following retreat at 17h00 to 18h00. Also, the emergence timings positively correlated with the sunrise timing and increasing temperature. Whereas, the retreat timings positively correlated with the sunset timing in disturbed burrows with continuous tourist visits, a significant change in the emergence, retreat and basking duration was observed. The time spent for basking significantly varied between disturbed, semi-disturbed and undisturbed burrows across different time-slots. The basking time across all the time intervals of the day around the undisturbed burrows was twofold of the time spent around disturbed burrows. The present study thus highlights the change in basking regime of Indian rock python in disturbed and undisturbed habitats in KNP, during the tourist's season of October to April each year.",Burrow activity; Camera trap; Disturbance; Ecotourism; Thermoregulation,"Mukherjee, Aditi; Kumara, Honnavalli Nagaraj; Bhupathy, Subramanian",2018,Journal,Global Ecology and Conservation,10.1016/j.gecco.2017.e00368,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989417301889,,English,2351-9894,
SD,Python framework for hp-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin methods for two-phase flow in porous media,In this paper we present a framework for solving two-phase flow problems in porous media. The discretization is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin method and includes local grid adaptivity and local choice of polynomial degree. The method is implemented using the new Python frontend Dune-FemPy to the open source framework Dune. The code used for the simulations is made available as Jupyter notebook and can be used through a Docker container. We present a number of time stepping approaches ranging from a classical IMPES method to a fully coupled implicit scheme. The implementation of the discretization is very flexible allowing to test different formulations of the two-phase flow model and adaptation strategies.,Discontinuous Galerkin; Dune; hp-adaptivity; IMPES; Porous media two-phase flow; Python,"Dedner, Andreas; Kane, Birane; Klöfkorn, Robert; Nolte, Martin",2019,Journal,Applied Mathematical Modelling,10.1016/j.apm.2018.10.013,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X18305043,,English,0307-904X,
SD,CUPyDO - An integrated Python environment for coupled fluid-structure simulations,"CUPyDO, a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) tool that couples existing independent fluid and solid solvers into a single synchronization and communication framework based on the Python language is presented. Each coupled solver has to be wrapped in a Python layer in order to embed their functionalities (usually written in a compiled language) into a Python object, that is called and used by the coupler. Thus a staggered strong coupling can be achieved for time-dependent FSI problems such as aeroelastic flutter, vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) or conjugate heat transfer (CHT). The synchronization between the solvers is performed with the predictive block-Gauss-Seidel algorithm with dynamic under-relaxation. The tool is capable of treating non-matching meshes between the fluid and structure domains and is optimized to work in parallel using Message Passing Interface (MPI). The implementation of CUPyDO is described and its capabilities are demonstrated on typical validation cases. The open-source code SU2 is used to solve the fluid equations while the solid equations are solved either by a simple rigid body integrator or by in-house linear/nonlinear Finite Element codes (GetDP/Metafor). First, the modularity of the coupling as well as its ease of use is highlighted and then the accuracy of the results is demonstrated.",Computational aeroelasticity; Coupling environment; CUPyDO; Fluid-structure interaction; Partitioned coupling; Python wrapper,"Thomas, D.; Cerquaglia, M.

SD,Automated rapid & intelligent microplastics mapping by FTIR microscopy: A Python–based workflow,"The analysis of environmental microplastic particles using FTIR microscopy is a challenging task, due to the very high number of individual particles within a single sample. Therefore, automatable, fast and robust approaches are highly requested. Micro particles were commonly enriched on filters, and sub- or the whole filter area was investigated, which took more than 20h and produced millions of data, which had to be evaluated. This paper presents a new approach of such filter area analysis using an intelligent algorithm to measure only those spots on a filter that would produce evaluable FTIR data. Empty spaces or IR absorbers like carbon black particles were not measured which successfully reduced the total analysis time from 50h to 7h. The presented method is based on system independent Python workflow and can easily be implemented on other FTIR systems. •Fast and intelligent FTIR microscopy area mapping without FPA detector•Total time reduction from 50 h to 7 h•Platform independent approach based on Python",Chemometrics; FTIR microscopy; Mapping; Microplasitcs; Python; Rapid and intelligent microplastics mapping (μMAP),"Renner, Gerrit; Schmidt, Torsten C.; Schram, Jürgen",2020,Journal,MethodsX,10.1016/j.mex.2019.11.015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016119303188,,English,2215-0161,
